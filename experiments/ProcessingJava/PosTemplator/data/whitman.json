INSCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\n\nOne's-Self I Sing\n\n  One's-self I sing, a simple separate person,\n  Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.\n\n  Of physiology from top to toe I sing,\n  Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\n      the Form complete is worthier far,\n  The Female equally with the Male I sing.\n\n  Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\n  Cheerful, for freest action form'd under the laws divine,\n  The Modern Man I sing.\n\n\n\n\nAs I Ponder'd in Silence\n\n  As I ponder'd in silence,\n  Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\n  A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\n  Terrible in beauty, age, and power,\n  The genius of poets of old lands,\n  As to me directing like flame its eyes,\n  With finger pointing to many immortal songs,\n  And menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\n  Know'st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?\n  And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\n  The making of perfect soldiers.\n\n  Be it so, then I answer'd,\n  I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\n  Waged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\n      and retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,\n  (Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\n      field the world,\n  For life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\n  Lo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\n  I above all promote brave soldiers.\n\n\n\n\nIn Cabin'd Ships at Sea\n\n  In cabin'd ships at sea,\n  The boundless blue on every side expanding,\n  With whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\n  Or some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,\n  Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\n  She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\n      many a star at night,\n  By sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\n  In full rapport at last.\n\n  Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts,\n  Here not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\n  The sky o'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\n  We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\n  The tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\n      briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\n  The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\n  The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\n  And this is ocean's poem.\n\n  Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\n  You not a reminiscence of the land alone,\n  You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos'd I know not\n      whither, yet ever full of faith,\n  Consort to every ship that sails, sail you!\n  Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\n      here in every leaf;)\n  Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\n      imperious waves,\n  Chant on, sail on, bear o'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\n  This song for mariners and all their ships.\n\n\n\n\nTo Foreign Lands\n\n  I heard that you ask'd for something to prove this puzzle the New World,\n  And to define America, her athletic Democracy,\n  Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\n\n\n\n\nTo a Historian\n\n  You who celebrate bygones,\n  Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life\n      that has exhibited itself,\n  Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,\n      rulers and priests,\n  I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself\n      in his own rights,\n  Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself,\n      (the great pride of man in himself,)\n  Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,\n  I project the history of the future.\n\n\n\n\nTo Thee Old Cause\n\n  To thee old cause!\n  Thou peerless, passionate, good cause,\n  Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\n  Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\n  After a strange sad war, great war for thee,\n  (I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\n      really fought, for thee,)\n  These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\n\n  (A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\n  Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)\n\n  Thou orb of many orbs!\n  Thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\n  Around the idea of thee the war revolving,\n  With all its angry and vehement play of causes,\n  (With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)\n  These recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,\n  Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\n  As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\n  Around the idea of thee.\n\n\n\n\nEidolons\n\n       I met a seer,\n  Passing the hues and objects of the world,\n  The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,\n       To glean eidolons.\n\n       Put in thy chants said he,\n  No more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,\n  Put first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,\n       That of eidolons.\n\n       Ever the dim beginning,\n  Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,\n  Ever the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)\n       Eidolons! eidolons!\n\n       Ever the mutable,\n  Ever materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,\n  Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,\n       Issuing eidolons.\n\n       Lo, I or you,\n  Or woman, man, or state, known or unknown,\n  We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,\n       But really build eidolons.\n\n       The ostent evanescent,\n  The substance of an artist's mood or savan's studies long,\n  Or warrior's, martyr's, hero's toils,\n       To fashion his eidolon.\n\n       Of every human life,\n  (The units gather'd, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)\n  The whole or large or small summ'd, added up,\n       In its eidolon.\n\n       The old, old urge,\n  Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,\n  From science and the modern still impell'd,\n       The old, old urge, eidolons.\n\n       The present now and here,\n  America's busy, teeming, intricate whirl,\n  Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,\n       To-day's eidolons.\n\n       These with the past,\n  Of vanish'd lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,\n  Old conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors' voyages,\n       Joining eidolons.\n\n       Densities, growth, facades,\n  Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,\n  Far-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,\n       Eidolons everlasting.\n\n       Exalte, rapt, ecstatic,\n  The visible but their womb of birth,\n  Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,\n       The mighty earth-eidolon.\n\n       All space, all time,\n  (The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\n  Swelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)\n       Fill'd with eidolons only.\n\n       The noiseless myriads,\n  The infinite oceans where the rivers empty,\n  The separate countless free identities, like eyesight,\n       The true realities, eidolons.\n\n       Not this the world,\n  Nor these the universes, they the universes,\n  Purport and end, ever the permanent life of life,\n       Eidolons, eidolons.\n\n       Beyond thy lectures learn'd professor,\n  Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen, beyond all mathematics,\n  Beyond the doctor's surgery, anatomy, beyond the chemist with his chemistry,\n       The entities of entities, eidolons.\n\n       Unfix'd yet fix'd,\n  Ever shall be, ever have been and are,\n  Sweeping the present to the infinite future,\n       Eidolons, eidolons, eidolons.\n\n       The prophet and the bard,\n  Shall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,\n  Shall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,\n       God and eidolons.\n\n       And thee my soul,\n  Joys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,\n  Thy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,\n       Thy mates, eidolons.\n\n       Thy body permanent,\n  The body lurking there within thy body,\n  The only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,\n       An image, an eidolon.\n\n       Thy very songs not in thy songs,\n  No special strains to sing, none for itself,\n  But from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,\n       A round full-orb'd eidolon.\n\n\n\n\nFor Him I Sing\n\n  For him I sing,\n  I raise the present on the past,\n  (As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)\n  With time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,\n  To make himself by them the law unto himself.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I Read the Book\n\n  When I read the book, the biography famous,\n  And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man's life?\n  And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?\n  (As if any man really knew aught of my life,\n  Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,\n  Only a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections\n  I seek for my own use to trace out here.)\n\n\n\n\nBeginning My Studies\n\n  Beginning my studies the first step pleas'd me so much,\n  The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\n  The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\n  The first step I say awed me and pleas'd me so much,\n  I have hardly gone and hardly wish'd to go any farther,\n  But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\n\n\n\n\nBeginners\n\n  How they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)\n  How dear and dreadful they are to the earth,\n  How they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox\n      appears their age,\n  How people respond to them, yet know them not,\n  How there is something relentless in their fate all times,\n  How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\n  And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same\n      great purchase.\n\n\n\n\nTo the States\n\n  To the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist\n      much, obey little,\n  Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\n  Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever\n      afterward resumes its liberty.\n\n\n\n\nOn Journeys Through the States\n\n  On journeys through the States we start,\n  (Ay through the world, urged by these songs,\n  Sailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)\n  We willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.\n\n  We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,\n  And have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the\n      seasons, and effuse as much?\n\n  We dwell a while in every city and town,\n  We pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the\n      Mississippi, and the Southern States,\n  We confer on equal terms with each of the States,\n  We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,\n  We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the\n      body and the soul,\n  Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,\n  And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,\n  And may be just as much as the seasons.\n\n\n\n\nTo a Certain Cantatrice\n\n  Here, take this gift,\n  I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,\n  One who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the\n      progress and freedom of the race,\n  Some brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;\n  But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.\n\n\n\n\nMe Imperturbe\n\n  Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,\n  Master of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,\n  Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,\n  Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less\n      important than I thought,\n  Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,\n      or far north or inland,\n  A river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these\n      States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,\n  Me wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,\n  To confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as\n      the trees and animals do.\n\n\n\n\nSavantism\n\n  Thither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and\n      nestling close, always obligated,\n  Thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,\n      establishments, even the most minute,\n  Thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;\n  Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,\n  As a father to his father going takes his children along with him.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ship Starting\n\n  Lo, the unbounded sea,\n  On its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even\n      her moonsails.\n  The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately--\n      below emulous waves press forward,\n  They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.\n\n\n\n\nI Hear America Singing\n\n  I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\n  Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,\n  The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\n  The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,\n  The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand\n      singing on the steamboat deck,\n  The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as\n      he stands,\n  The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morning,\n      or at noon intermission or at sundown,\n  The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,\n      or of the girl sewing or washing,\n  Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\n  The day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young\n      fellows, robust, friendly,\n  Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Place Is Besieged?\n\n  What place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\n  Lo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,\n  And with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,\n  And artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.\n\n\n\n\nStill Though the One I Sing\n\n  Still though the one I sing,\n  (One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,\n  I leave in him revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O\n      quenchless, indispensable fire!)\n\n\n\n\nShut Not Your Doors\n\n  Shut not your doors to me proud libraries,\n  For that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, yet\n      needed most, I bring,\n  Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made,\n  The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing,\n  A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt by the intellect,\n  But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.\n\n\n\n\nPoets to Come\n\n  Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!\n  Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,\n  But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than\n      before known,\n  Arouse! for you must justify me.\n\n  I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,\n  I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.\n\n  I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a\n      casual look upon you and then averts his face,\n  Leaving it to you to prove and define it,\n  Expecting the main things from you.\n\n\n\n\nTo You\n\n  Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why\n      should you not speak to me?\n  And why should I not speak to you?\n\n\n\n\nThou Reader\n\n  Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I,\n  Therefore for thee the following chants.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\nStarting from Paumanok\n\n       1\n  Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,\n  Well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,\n  After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,\n  Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,\n  Or a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner\n      in California,\n  Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my drink from\n      the spring,\n  Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,\n  Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,\n  Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of\n      mighty Niagara,\n  Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and\n      strong-breasted bull,\n  Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow,\n      my amaze,\n  Having studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the\n      mountain-hawk,\n  And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush from the\n      swamp-cedars,\n  Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.\n\n       2\n  Victory, union, faith, identity, time,\n  The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,\n  Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.\n  This then is life,\n  Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.\n\n  How curious! how real!\n  Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.\n\n  See revolving the globe,\n  The ancestor-continents away group'd together,\n  The present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus\n      between.\n\n  See, vast trackless spaces,\n  As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,\n  Countless masses debouch upon them,\n  They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.\n\n  See, projected through time,\n  For me an audience interminable.\n\n  With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,\n  Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,\n  One generation playing its part and passing on,\n  Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,\n  With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,\n  With eyes retrospective towards me.\n\n       3\n  Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!\n  Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!\n  For you a programme of chants.\n\n  Chants of the prairies,\n  Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea,\n  Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,\n  Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence equidistant,\n  Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.\n\n       4\n  Take my leaves America, take them South and take them North,\n  Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own off-spring,\n  Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,\n  And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect\n      lovingly with you.\n\n  I conn'd old times,\n  I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,\n  Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.\n\n  In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?\n  Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.\n\n       5\n  Dead poets, philosophs, priests,\n  Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,\n  Language-shapers on other shores,\n  Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,\n  I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left\n      wafted hither,\n  I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)\n  Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more\n      than it deserves,\n  Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,\n  I stand in my place with my own day here.\n\n  Here lands female and male,\n  Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of\n      materials,\n  Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow'd,\n  The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms,\n  The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,\n  Yes here comes my mistress the soul.\n\n       6\n  The soul,\n  Forever and forever--longer than soil is brown and solid--longer\n      than water ebbs and flows.\n  I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the\n      most spiritual poems,\n  And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,\n  For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and\n      of immortality.\n\n  I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any\n      circumstances be subjected to another State,\n  And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by\n      night between all the States, and between any two of them,\n  And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of\n      weapons with menacing points,\n  And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;\n  And a song make I of the One form'd out of all,\n  The fang'd and glittering One whose head is over all,\n  Resolute warlike One including and over all,\n  (However high the head of any else that head is over all.)\n\n  I will acknowledge contemporary lands,\n  I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously\n      every city large and small,\n  And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism\n      upon land and sea,\n  And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.\n\n  I will sing the song of companionship,\n  I will show what alone must finally compact these,\n  I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,\n      indicating it in me,\n  I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were\n      threatening to consume me,\n  I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,\n  I will give them complete abandonment,\n  I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,\n  For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?\n  And who but I should be the poet of comrades?\n\n       7\n  I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,\n  I advance from the people in their own spirit,\n  Here is what sings unrestricted faith.\n\n  Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,\n  I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,\n  I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is--and I say\n      there is in fact no evil,\n  (Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or\n      to me, as any thing else.)\n\n  I too, following many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a religion, I\n      descend into the arena,\n  (It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the\n      winner's pealing shouts,\n  Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)\n\n  Each is not for its own sake,\n  I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's sake.\n\n  I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,\n  None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,\n  None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain\n      the future is.\n\n  I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be\n      their religion,\n  Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur;\n  (Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,\n  Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)\n\n       8\n  What are you doing young man?\n  Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?\n  These ostensible realities, politics, points?\n  Your ambition or business whatever it may be?\n\n  It is well--against such I say not a word, I am their poet also,\n  But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion's sake,\n  For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential\n      life of the earth,\n  Any more than such are to religion.\n\n       9\n  What do you seek so pensive and silent?\n  What do you need camerado?\n  Dear son do you think it is love?\n\n  Listen dear son--listen America, daughter or son,\n  It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it\n      satisfies, it is great,\n  But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coincide,\n  It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps and\n      provides for all.\n\n       10\n  Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,\n  The following chants each for its kind I sing.\n\n  My comrade!\n  For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising\n      inclusive and more resplendent,\n  The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Religion.\n\n  Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,\n  Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,\n  Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me,\n  Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we\n      know not of,\n  Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,\n  These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.\n\n  Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me,\n  Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,\n  Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world,\n  After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.\n\n  O such themes--equalities! O divine average!\n  Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or setting,\n  Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,\n  I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and\n      cheerfully pass them forward.\n\n       11\n  As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,\n  I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in\n      the briers hatching her brood.\n\n  I have seen the he-bird also,\n  I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and\n      joyfully singing.\n\n  And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for was\n      not there only,\n  Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,\n  But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,\n  A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.\n\n       12\n  Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and\n      joyfully singing.\n\n  Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,\n  For those who belong here and those to come,\n  I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger\n      and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.\n\n  I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,\n  And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes,\n      and carry you with me the same as any.\n\n  I will make the true poem of riches,\n  To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward\n      and is not dropt by death;\n  I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the\n      bard of personality,\n  And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of\n      the other,\n  And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am determin'd\n      to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious,\n  And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and\n      can be none in the future,\n  And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn'd to\n      beautiful results,\n  And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death,\n  And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are\n      compact,\n  And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each\n      as profound as any.\n\n  I will not make poems with reference to parts,\n  But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,\n  And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to\n      all days,\n  And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has\n      reference to the soul,\n  Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find there\n      is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul.\n\n       13\n  Was somebody asking to see the soul?\n  See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts,\n      the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.\n\n  All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;\n  How can the real body ever die and be buried?\n\n  Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,\n  Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and\n      pass to fitting spheres,\n  Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the\n      moment of death.\n\n  Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the\n      meaning, the main concern,\n  Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's substance and\n      life return in the body and the soul,\n  Indifferently before death and after death.\n\n  Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and\n      includes and is the soul;\n  Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part\n      of it!\n\n       14\n  Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!\n\n  Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?\n  Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?\n  Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,\n  Exulting words, words to Democracy's lands.\n\n  Interlink'd, food-yielding lands!\n  Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar, rice!\n  Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the apple\n      and the grape!\n  Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! land of\n      those sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!\n  Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!\n  Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where the south-west\n      Colorado winds!\n  Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!\n  Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!\n  Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and\n      Connecticut!\n  Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!\n  Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land!\n  Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate ones!\n  The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony-limb'd!\n  The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and\n      the inexperienced sisters!\n  Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the diverse! the\n      compact!\n  The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!\n  O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at any\n      rate include you all with perfect love!\n  I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner than another!\n  O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with\n      irrepressible love,\n  Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,\n  Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on\n      Paumanok's sands,\n  Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in every town,\n  Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,\n  Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,\n  Of and through the States as during life, each man and woman my neighbor,\n  The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him and her,\n  The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with any of them,\n  Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house of adobie,\n  Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland,\n  Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice welcome to me,\n  Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the\n      Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,\n  Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every\n      new brother,\n  Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they\n      unite with the old ones,\n  Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal,\n      coming personally to you now,\n  Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.\n\n       15\n  With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on.\n  For your life adhere to me,\n  (I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give\n      myself really to you, but what of that?\n  Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)\n\n  No dainty dolce affettuoso I,\n  Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,\n  To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,\n  For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.\n\n       16\n  On my way a moment I pause,\n  Here for you! and here for America!\n  Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I\n      harbinge glad and sublime,\n  And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.\n\n  The red aborigines,\n  Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds\n      and animals in the woods, syllabled to us for names,\n  Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee,\n      Kaqueta, Oronoco,\n  Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla,\n  Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging the\n      water and the land with names.\n\n       17\n  Expanding and swift, henceforth,\n  Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and audacious,\n  A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and branching,\n  A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with new contests,\n  New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.\n\n  These, my voice announcing--I will sleep no more but arise,\n  You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you,\n      fathomless, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms.\n\n       18\n  See, steamers steaming through my poems,\n  See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing,\n  See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flat-boat,\n      the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village,\n  See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern Sea,\n      how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their own shores,\n  See, pastures and forests in my poems--see, animals wild and tame--see,\n      beyond the Kaw, countless herds of buffalo feeding on short curly grass,\n  See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets,\n      with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,\n  See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press--see, the electric\n      telegraph stretching across the continent,\n  See, through Atlantica's depths pulses American Europe reaching,\n      pulses of Europe duly return'd,\n  See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing\n      the steam-whistle,\n  See, ploughmen ploughing farms--see, miners digging mines--see,\n      the numberless factories,\n  See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools--see from among them\n      superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in\n      working dresses,\n  See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me\n      well-belov'd, close-held by day and night,\n  Hear the loud echoes of my songs there--read the hints come at last.\n\n       19\n  O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.\n  O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!\n  O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!\n  O now I triumph--and you shall also;\n  O hand in hand--O wholesome pleasure--O one more desirer and lover!\n  O to haste firm holding--to haste, haste on with me.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n\nSong of Myself\n\n       1\n  I celebrate myself, and sing myself,\n  And what I assume you shall assume,\n  For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\n\n  I loafe and invite my soul,\n  I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.\n\n  My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,\n  Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their\n      parents the same,\n  I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,\n  Hoping to cease not till death.\n\n  Creeds and schools in abeyance,\n  Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,\n  I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,\n  Nature without check with original energy.\n\n       2\n  Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with\n      perfumes,\n  I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,\n  The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\n\n  The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the\n      distillation, it is odorless,\n  It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,\n  I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,\n  I am mad for it to be in contact with me.\n\n  The smoke of my own breath,\n  Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,\n  My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing\n      of blood and air through my lungs,\n  The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and\n      dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,\n\n  The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of\n      the wind,\n  A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\n  The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,\n  The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields\n      and hill-sides,\n  The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising\n      from bed and meeting the sun.\n\n  Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?\n  Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?\n  Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\n\n  Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of\n      all poems,\n  You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions\n      of suns left,)\n  You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through\n      the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\n  You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\n  You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\n\n       3\n  I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\n      beginning and the end,\n  But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\n\n  There was never any more inception than there is now,\n  Nor any more youth or age than there is now,\n  And will never be any more perfection than there is now,\n  Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\n\n  Urge and urge and urge,\n  Always the procreant urge of the world.\n\n  Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and\n      increase, always sex,\n  Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\n  To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.\n\n  Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\n      entretied, braced in the beams,\n  Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\n  I and this mystery here we stand.\n\n  Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.\n\n  Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\n  Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\n\n  Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\n  Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they\n      discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\n\n  Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,\n  Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be\n      less familiar than the rest.\n\n  I am satisfied--I see, dance, laugh, sing;\n  As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,\n      and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,\n  Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house with\n      their plenty,\n  Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\n  That they turn from gazing after and down the road,\n  And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\n  Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?\n\n       4\n  Trippers and askers surround me,\n  People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and\n      city I live in, or the nation,\n  The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\n  My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\n  The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\n  The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss\n      or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\n  Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,\n      the fitful events;\n  These come to me days and nights and go from me again,\n  But they are not the Me myself.\n\n  Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\n  Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\n  Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\n  Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\n  Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\n\n  Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with\n      linguists and contenders,\n  I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\n\n       5\n  I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\n  And you must not be abased to the other.\n\n  Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\n  Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not\n      even the best,\n  Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\n\n  I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\n  How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,\n  And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue\n      to my bare-stript heart,\n  And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.\n\n  Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass\n      all the argument of the earth,\n  And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\n  And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\n  And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women\n      my sisters and lovers,\n  And that a kelson of the creation is love,\n  And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\n  And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\n  And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and\n      poke-weed.\n\n       6\n  A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\n  How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.\n\n  I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green\n      stuff woven.\n\n  Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\n  A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\n  Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see\n      and remark, and say Whose?\n\n  Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\n\n  Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\n  And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\n  Growing among black folks as among white,\n  Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I\n      receive them the same.\n\n  And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\n  Tenderly will I use you curling grass,\n  It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\n  It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\n  It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out\n      of their mothers' laps,\n  And here you are the mothers' laps.\n\n  This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,\n  Darker than the colorless beards of old men,\n  Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\n  O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\n  And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\n\n  I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\n  And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken\n      soon out of their laps.\n\n  What do you think has become of the young and old men?\n  And what do you think has become of the women and children?\n\n  They are alive and well somewhere,\n  The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\n  And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the\n      end to arrest it,\n  And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.\n\n  All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\n  And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\n\n       7\n  Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?\n  I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\n\n  I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and\n      am not contain'd between my hat and boots,\n  And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,\n  The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\n\n  I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\n  I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\n      fathomless as myself,\n  (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\n\n  Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\n  For me those that have been boys and that love women,\n  For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\n  For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\n      mothers of mothers,\n  For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\n  For me children and the begetters of children.\n\n  Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\n  I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\n  And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\n\n       8\n  The little one sleeps in its cradle,\n  I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\n      with my hand.\n\n  The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\n  I peeringly view them from the top.\n\n  The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\n  I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\n      has fallen.\n\n  The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\n      the promenaders,\n  The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\n      clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\n  The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\n  The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,\n  The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\n  The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\n  The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\n      passage to the centre of the crowd,\n  The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\n  What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or in fits,\n  What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\n      give birth to babes,\n  What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\n      restrain'd by decorum,\n  Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\n      rejections with convex lips,\n  I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\n\n       9\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\n  The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\n  The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\n\n  I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\n  I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n       10\n  Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\n  Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\n  In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\n  Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,\n  Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\n  The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\n  My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\n\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\n  I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\n  I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\n      the bride was a red girl,\n  Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\n      they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\n      hanging from their shoulders,\n  On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\n      beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\n  She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\n      descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.\n\n  The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\n  I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\n  Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\n  And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\n  And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd feet,\n  And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some\n      coarse clean clothes,\n  And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\n  And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\n  He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,\n  I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.\n\n       11\n  Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\n  Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\n  Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\n\n  She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\n  She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\n\n  Which of the young men does she like the best?\n  Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\n  Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,\n  You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\n  Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\n  The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\n  The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long hair,\n  Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.\n\n  An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,\n  It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\n  The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\n      sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\n  They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\n  They do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n       12\n  The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\n      at the stall in the market,\n  I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\n  Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\n  Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\n      the fire.\n\n  From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,\n  The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\n  Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\n  They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n       13\n  The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\n      underneath on its tied-over chain,\n  The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\n      tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,\n  His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\n      his hip-band,\n  His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\n      away from his forehead,\n  The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\n      his polish'd and perfect limbs.\n\n  I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\n  I go with the team also.\n\n  In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\n      forward sluing,\n  To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\n  Absorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\n  Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\n      is that you express in your eyes?\n  It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\n  My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\n      day-long ramble,\n  They rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\n  I believe in those wing'd purposes,\n  And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\n  And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\n  And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\n  And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\n  And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n       14\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\n  Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\n  The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\n  Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\n  The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\n      chickadee, the prairie-dog,\n  The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\n  The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\n  I see in them and myself the same old law.\n\n  The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\n  They scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\n  I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,\n  Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\n  Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\n      mauls, and the drivers of horses,\n  I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\n  What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\n  Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\n  Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\n  Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,\n  Scattering it freely forever.\n\n       15\n  The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\n  The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\n      whistles its wild ascending lisp,\n  The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,\n  The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,\n  The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,\n  The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\n  The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,\n  The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,\n  The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and\n      looks at the oats and rye,\n  The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,\n  (He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's\n      bed-room;)\n  The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,\n  He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;\n  The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,\n  What is removed drops horribly in a pail;\n  The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by\n      the bar-room stove,\n  The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat,\n      the gate-keeper marks who pass,\n  The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do\n      not know him;)\n  The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\n  The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their\n      rifles, some sit on logs,\n  Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;\n  The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\n  As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them\n      from his saddle,\n  The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\n      partners, the dancers bow to each other,\n  The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to the\n      musical rain,\n  The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\n  The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering moccasins and\n      bead-bags for sale,\n  The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut\n      eyes bent sideways,\n  As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for\n      the shore-going passengers,\n  The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it\n      off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,\n  The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne\n      her first child,\n  The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the\n      factory or mill,\n  The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter's lead\n      flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering\n      with blue and gold,\n  The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his\n      desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\n  The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,\n  The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\n  The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white\n      sails sparkle!)\n  The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\n  The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling\n      about the odd cent;)\n  The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock\n      moves slowly,\n  The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,\n  The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and\n      pimpled neck,\n  The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to\n      each other,\n  (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\n  The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great\n      Secretaries,\n  On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,\n  The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,\n  The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,\n  As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the\n      jingling of loose change,\n  The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\n      roof, the masons are calling for mortar,\n  In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;\n  Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd, it\n      is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)\n  Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows,\n      and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\n  Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in\n      the frozen surface,\n  The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep\n      with his axe,\n  Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,\n  Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\n      those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\n  Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,\n  Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons\n      around them,\n  In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after\n      their day's sport,\n  The city sleeps and the country sleeps,\n  The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\n  The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;\n  And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\n  And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\n  And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n       16\n  I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\n  Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,\n  Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\n  Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff\n      that is fine,\n  One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the\n      largest the same,\n  A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and\n      hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\n  A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest\n      joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\n  A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\n      leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\n  A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;\n  At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen\n      off Newfoundland,\n  At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,\n  At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the\n      Texan ranch,\n  Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving\n      their big proportions,)\n  Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands\n      and welcome to drink and meat,\n  A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\n  A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\n  Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\n  A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\n  Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\n\n  I resist any thing better than my own diversity,\n  Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,\n  And am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n\n  (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\n  The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,\n  The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n       17\n  These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they\n      are not original with me,\n  If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,\n  If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,\n  If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.\n\n  This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,\n  This the common air that bathes the globe.\n\n       18\n  With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\n  I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for\n      conquer'd and slain persons.\n\n  Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?\n  I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit\n      in which they are won.\n\n  I beat and pound for the dead,\n  I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\n\n  Vivas to those who have fail'd!\n  And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\n  And to those themselves who sank in the sea!\n  And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!\n  And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!\n\n       19\n  This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\n  It is for the wicked just same as the righteous, I make appointments\n      with all,\n  I will not have a single person slighted or left away,\n  The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\n  The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\n  There shall be no difference between them and the rest.\n\n  This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,\n  This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\n  This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\n  This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\n  Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?\n  Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the\n      side of a rock has.\n\n  Do you take it I would astonish?\n  Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\n      through the woods?\n  Do I astonish more than they?\n\n  This hour I tell things in confidence,\n  I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n       20\n  Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\n  How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\n\n  What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\n\n  All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\n  Else it were time lost listening to me.\n\n  I do not snivel that snivel the world over,\n  That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\n\n  Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity\n      goes to the fourth-remov'd,\n  I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\n\n  Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\n  Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with\n      doctors and calculated close,\n  I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\n\n  In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\n  And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\n\n  I know I am solid and sound,\n  To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\n  All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\n\n  I know I am deathless,\n  I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,\n  I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt\n      stick at night.\n\n  I know I am august,\n  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\n  I see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n  (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by,\n      after all.)\n\n  I exist as I am, that is enough,\n  If no other in the world be aware I sit content,\n  And if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\n  One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,\n  And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten\n      million years,\n  I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\n  My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,\n  I laugh at what you call dissolution,\n  And I know the amplitude of time.\n\n       21\n  I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\n  The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,\n  The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate\n      into new tongue.\n\n  I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\n  And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\n  And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\n  I chant the chant of dilation or pride,\n  We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\n  I show that size is only development.\n\n  Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?\n  It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\n      still pass on.\n\n  I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\n  I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\n  Press close bare-bosom'd night--press close magnetic nourishing night!\n  Night of south winds--night of the large few stars!\n  Still nodding night--mad naked summer night.\n\n  Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!\n  Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\n  Earth of departed sunset--earth of the mountains misty-topt!\n  Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\n  Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\n  Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\n  Far-swooping elbow'd earth--rich apple-blossom'd earth!\n  Smile, for your lover comes.\n\n  Prodigal, you have given me love--therefore I to you give love!\n  O unspeakable passionate love.\n\n       22\n  You sea! I resign myself to you also--I guess what you mean,\n  I behold from the beach your crooked fingers,\n  I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\n  We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,\n  Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\n  Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\n  Sea of stretch'd ground-swells,\n  Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\n  Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready graves,\n  Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\n  I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\n  Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\n  Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.\n\n  I am he attesting sympathy,\n  (Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that\n      supports them?)\n\n  I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet\n      of wickedness also.\n\n  What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\n  Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,\n  My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,\n  I moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\n  Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\n  Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and rectified?\n\n  I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance,\n  Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\n  Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\n  This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\n  There is no better than it and now.\n\n  What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such wonder,\n  The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\n\n       23\n  Endless unfolding of words of ages!\n  And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\n  A word of the faith that never balks,\n  Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.\n\n  It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\n  That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\n  I accept Reality and dare not question it,\n  Materialism first and last imbuing.\n\n  Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\n  Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\n  This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of\n      the old cartouches,\n  These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.\n  This is the geologist, this works with the scalper, and this is a\n      mathematician.\n\n  Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!\n  Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\n  I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\n  Less the reminders of properties told my words,\n  And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\n  And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and\n      women fully equipt,\n  And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that\n      plot and conspire.\n\n       24\n  Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\n  Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,\n  No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\n  No more modest than immodest.\n\n  Unscrew the locks from the doors!\n  Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\n  Whoever degrades another degrades me,\n  And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\n  Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current\n      and index.\n\n  I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\n  By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their\n      counterpart of on the same terms.\n\n  Through me many long dumb voices,\n  Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,\n  Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\n  Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\n  And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the\n      father-stuff,\n  And of the rights of them the others are down upon,\n  Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\n  Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\n  Through me forbidden voices,\n  Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,\n  Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.\n\n  I do not press my fingers across my mouth,\n  I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\n  Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\n  I believe in the flesh and the appetites,\n  Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me\n      is a miracle.\n\n  Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am\n      touch'd from,\n  The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\n  This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\n  If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of\n      my own body, or any part of it,\n  Translucent mould of me it shall be you!\n  Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\n  Firm masculine colter it shall be you!\n  Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\n  You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\n  Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\n  My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\n  Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded\n      duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\n  Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\n  Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\n  Sun so generous it shall be you!\n  Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\n  You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\n  Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\n  Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my\n      winding paths, it shall be you!\n  Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd,\n      it shall be you.\n\n  I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\n  Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\n  I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,\n  Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\n      friendship I take again.\n\n  That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\n  A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics\n      of books.\n\n  To behold the day-break!\n  The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\n  The air tastes good to my palate.\n\n  Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising\n      freshly exuding,\n  Scooting obliquely high and low.\n\n  Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\n  Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\n  The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\n  The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\n  The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n       25\n  Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\n  If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\n\n  We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\n  We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\n\n  My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\n  With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\n\n  Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\n  It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\n  Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?\n\n  Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\n      articulation,\n  Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\n  Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,\n  The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\n  I underlying causes to balance them at last,\n  My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\n  Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\n      of this day.)\n\n  My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\n  Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\n  I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\n\n  Writing and talk do not prove me,\n  I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\n  With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n       26\n  Now I will do nothing but listen,\n  To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\n\n  I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,\n      clack of sticks cooking my meals,\n  I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\n  I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\n  Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\n  Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of\n      work-people at their meals,\n  The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\n  The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing\n      a death-sentence,\n  The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the\n      refrain of the anchor-lifters,\n  The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking\n      engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd lights,\n  The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\n  The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and two,\n  (They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\n\n  I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)\n  I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\n  It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\n  I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\n  Ah this indeed is music--this suits me.\n\n  A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\n  The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\n  I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\n  The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\n  It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd them,\n  It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent waves,\n  I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\n  Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\n  At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\n  And that we call Being.\n\n       27\n  To be in any form, what is that?\n  (Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\n  If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\n\n  Mine is no callous shell,\n  I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\n  They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\n  I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\n  To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.\n\n       28\n  Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\n  Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,\n  Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\n  My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\n      different from myself,\n  On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\n  Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\n  Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\n  Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,\n  Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\n  Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\n  Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\n  They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\n  No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\n  Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\n  Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\n  The sentries desert every other part of me,\n  They have left me helpless to a red marauder,\n  They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\n\n  I am given up by traitors,\n  I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\n      greatest traitor,\n  I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\n\n  You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\n  Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n       29\n  Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch!\n  Did it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\n  Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\n  Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\n  Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\n  Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n       30\n  All truths wait in all things,\n  They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\n  They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\n  The insignificant is as big to me as any,\n  (What is less or more than a touch?)\n\n  Logic and sermons never convince,\n  The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n  (Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\n  Only what nobody denies is so.)\n\n  A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\n  I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\n  And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\n  And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\n  And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\n      becomes omnific,\n  And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n       31\n  I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,\n  And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\n      of the wren,\n  And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\n  And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\n  And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\n  And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,\n  And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\n\n  I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\n      grains, esculent roots,\n  And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\n  And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\n  But call any thing back again when I desire it.\n\n  In vain the speeding or shyness,\n  In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\n  In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,\n  In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\n  In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\n  In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\n  In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\n  In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\n  In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,\n  I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\n       32\n  I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\n      self-contain'd,\n  I stand and look at them long and long.\n\n  They do not sweat and whine about their condition,\n  They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\n  They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\n  Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\n      owning things,\n  Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\n      years ago,\n  Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\n  So they show their relations to me and I accept them,\n  They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their\n      possession.\n\n  I wonder where they get those tokens,\n  Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\n\n  Myself moving forward then and now and forever,\n  Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,\n  Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\n  Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\n  Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\n  A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\n  Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\n  Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\n  Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\n\n  His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\n  His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\n\n  I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\n  Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\n  Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n       33\n  Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,\n  What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,\n  What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,\n  And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\n  My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\n  I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\n  I am afoot with my vision.\n\n  By the city's quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumber-men,\n  Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\n  Weeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,\n      crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\n  Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\n  Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\n      shallow river,\n  Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\n      buck turns furiously at the hunter,\n  Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\n      otter is feeding on fish,\n  Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\n  Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\n      beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\n  Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over\n      the rice in its low moist field,\n  Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and\n      slender shoots from the gutters,\n  Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the\n      delicate blue-flower flax,\n  Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\n      the rest,\n  Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\n  Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\n      scragged limbs,\n  Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\n  Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\n  Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\n      goldbug drops through the dark,\n  Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\n      the meadow,\n  Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\n      shuddering of their hides,\n  Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle\n      the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\n  Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\n  Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\n  Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\n      myself and looking composedly down,)\n  Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\n      hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\n  Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\n  Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\n  Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\n  Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,\n  Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\n  Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\n  Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\n  Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\n  Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\n  Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\n      base-ball,\n  At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\n      bull-dances, drinking, laughter,\n  At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the\n      juice through a straw,\n  At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\n  At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;\n  Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\n      screams, weeps,\n  Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are\n      scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\n  Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to\n      the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\n  Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\n  Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\n  Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\n      far and near,\n  Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\n      swan is curving and winding,\n  Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\n      near-human laugh,\n  Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\n      high weeds,\n  Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\n      their heads out,\n  Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,\n  Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\n  Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\n      night and feeds upon small crabs,\n  Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\n  Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\n      the well,\n  Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\n  Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\n  Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the\n      office or public hall;\n  Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with\n      the new and old,\n  Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\n  Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\n  Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,\n  Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,\n      impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;\n  Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\n      flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\n  Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds,\n      or down a lane or along the beach,\n  My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\n  Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me\n      he rides at the drape of the day,)\n  Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the\n      moccasin print,\n  By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\n  Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\n  Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\n  Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\n  Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\n  Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\n  Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\n  Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\n  Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\n      diameter of eighty thousand miles,\n  Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\n  Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\n  Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\n  Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,\n  I tread day and night such roads.\n\n  I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\n  And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.\n\n  I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\n  My course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\n  I help myself to material and immaterial,\n  No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\n  I anchor my ship for a little while only,\n  My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\n\n  I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\n      pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\n  I ascend to the foretruck,\n  I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,\n  We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\n  Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\n  The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\n      plain in all directions,\n  The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\n      fancies toward them,\n  We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\n      be engaged,\n  We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\n      feet and caution,\n  Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,\n  The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\n      of the globe.\n\n  I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\n  I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\n  I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\n  My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\n  They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.\n\n  I understand the large hearts of heroes,\n  The courage of present times and all times,\n  How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\n      steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\n  How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\n      days and faithful of nights,\n  And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\n      not desert you;\n  How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and\n      would not give it up,\n  How he saved the drifting company at last,\n  How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the\n      side of their prepared graves,\n  How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\n      sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;\n  All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\n  I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.\n\n  The disdain and calmness of martyrs,\n  The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\n      children gazing on,\n  The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\n      blowing, cover'd with sweat,\n  The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\n      buckshot and the bullets,\n  All these I feel or am.\n\n  I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\n  Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\n  I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the\n      ooze of my skin,\n  I fall on the weeds and stones,\n  The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\n  Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\n  Agonies are one of my changes of garments,\n  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\n      wounded person,\n  My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\n  I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,\n  Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,\n  Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\n  I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\n  They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\n\n  I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\n  Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\n  White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\n      of their fire-caps,\n  The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\n  Distant and dead resuscitate,\n  They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\n\n  I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,\n  I am there again.\n\n  Again the long roll of the drummers,\n  Again the attacking cannon, mortars,\n  Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\n\n  I take part, I see and hear the whole,\n  The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\n  The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\n  Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\n  The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\n  The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\n  Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\n      with his hand,\n  He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\n\n       34\n  Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n  (I tell not the fall of Alamo,\n  Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\n  The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n  'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\n      young men.\n\n  Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for\n      breastworks,\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\n      number, was the price they took in advance,\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and\n      seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war.\n\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers,\n  Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\n  Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\n  Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\n\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\n      massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\n  The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.\n\n  None obey'd the command to kneel,\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\n  A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\n      lay together,\n  The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\n  Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,\n  These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of muskets,\n  A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more\n      came to release him,\n  The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.\n\n  At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\n       35\n  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\n  List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me.\n\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\n  His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\n      and never was, and never will be;\n  Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.\n\n  We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,\n  My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.\n\n  We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\n  Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\n  Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\n      and five feet of water reported,\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\n\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\n  Our frigate takes fire,\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\n  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\n  We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\n      of the fighting.\n\n  Only three guns are in use,\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main-mast,\n  Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and\n      clear his decks.\n\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\n      the main-top,\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\n  Not a moment's cease,\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\n\n  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\n\n  Serene stands the little captain,\n  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\n\n       36\n  Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\n      one we have conquer'd,\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\n      countenance white as a sheet,\n  Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\n      curl'd whiskers,\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\n  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\n  Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\n      upon the masts and spars,\n  Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\n  Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\n  A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\n  Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\n      the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\n  The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\n  Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\n      dull, tapering groan,\n  These so, these irretrievable.\n\n       37\n  You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\n  In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!\n  Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,\n  See myself in prison shaped like another man,\n  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.\n\n  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\n  It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.\n\n  Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him\n      and walk by his side,\n  (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\n      on my twitching lips.)\n\n  Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\n      and sentenced.\n\n  Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\n  My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\n\n  Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\n  I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\n\n       38\n  Enough! enough! enough!\n  Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!\n  Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\n  I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\n\n  That I could forget the mockers and insults!\n  That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\n      bludgeons and hammers!\n  That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\n      bloody crowning.\n\n  I remember now,\n  I resume the overstaid fraction,\n  The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\n  Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\n\n  I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average\n      unending procession,\n  Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\n  Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\n  The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\n\n  Eleves, I salute you! come forward!\n  Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.\n\n       39\n  The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\n  Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\n\n  Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?\n  Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\n  The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\n  Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\n  They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.\n\n  Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd\n      head, laughter, and naivete,\n  Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,\n  They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\n  They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of\n      the glance of his eyes.\n\n       40\n  Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie over!\n  You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\n\n  Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\n  Say, old top-knot, what do you want?\n\n  Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\n  And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\n  And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.\n\n  Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\n  When I give I give myself.\n\n  You there, impotent, loose in the knees,\n  Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,\n  Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,\n  I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,\n  And any thing I have I bestow.\n\n  I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\n  You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.\n\n  To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\n  On his right cheek I put the family kiss,\n  And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\n  On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.\n  (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)\n\n  To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.\n  Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\n  Let the physician and the priest go home.\n\n  I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\n  O despairer, here is my neck,\n  By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.\n\n  I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\n  Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,\n  Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\n  Sleep--I and they keep guard all night,\n  Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\n  I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\n  And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\n\n       41\n  I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\n  And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\n  I heard what was said of the universe,\n  Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;\n  It is middling well as far as it goes--but is that all?\n\n  Magnifying and applying come I,\n  Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\n  Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\n  Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\n  Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\n  In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix\n      engraved,\n  With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,\n  Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\n  Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n  (They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and fly\n      and sing for themselves,)\n  Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,\n      bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\n  Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\n  Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves\n      driving the mallet and chisel,\n  Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or\n      a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,\n  Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me\n      than the gods of the antique wars,\n  Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\n  Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white\n      foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\n  By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for\n      every person born,\n  Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels\n      with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,\n  The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,\n  Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his\n      brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\n  What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and\n      not filling the square rod then,\n  The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,\n  Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,\n  The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of\n      the supremes,\n  The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the\n      best, and be as prodigious;\n  By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\n  Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the shadows.\n\n\n      42\n  A call in the midst of the crowd,\n  My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\n\n  Come my children,\n  Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,\n  Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude on\n      the reeds within.\n\n  Easily written loose-finger'd chords--I feel the thrum of your\n      climax and close.\n\n  My head slues round on my neck,\n  Music rolls, but not from the organ,\n  Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\n\n  Ever the hard unsunk ground,\n  Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever\n      the air and the ceaseless tides,\n  Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\n  Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that\n      breath of itches and thirsts,\n  Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides\n      and bring him forth,\n  Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\n  Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\n\n  Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\n  To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\n  Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,\n  Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment\n      receiving,\n  A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\n  This is the city and I am one of the citizens,\n  Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets,\n      newspapers, schools,\n  The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,\n      stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\n\n  The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd coats\n  I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)\n  I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest\n      is deathless with me,\n  What I do and say the same waits for them,\n  Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.\n\n  I know perfectly well my own egotism,\n  Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\n  And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\n  Not words of routine this song of mine,\n  But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\n  This printed and bound book--but the printer and the\n      printing-office boy?\n  The well-taken photographs--but your wife or friend close and solid\n      in your arms?\n  The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets--but\n      the pluck of the captain and engineers?\n  In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture--but the host and\n      hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\n  The sky up there--yet here or next door, or across the way?\n  The saints and sages in history--but you yourself?\n  Sermons, creeds, theology--but the fathomless human brain,\n  And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n       43\n  I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\n  My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\n  Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,\n  Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,\n  Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,\n  Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in\n      the circle of obis,\n  Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\n  Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and\n      austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\n  Drinking mead from the skull-cap, to Shastas and Vedas admirant,\n      minding the Koran,\n  Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife,\n      beating the serpent-skin drum,\n  Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing\n      assuredly that he is divine,\n  To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting\n      patiently in a pew,\n  Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till\n      my spirit arouses me,\n  Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,\n  Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\n  One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like\n      man leaving charges before a journey.\n\n  Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\n  Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical,\n  I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair\n      and unbelief.\n\n  How the flukes splash!\n  How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!\n\n  Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\n  I take my place among you as much as among any,\n  The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\n  And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely\n      the same.\n\n  I do not know what is untried and afterward,\n  But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\n\n  Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd, not\n      single one can it fall.\n\n  It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried,\n  Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\n  Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew back\n      and was never seen again,\n  Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with\n      bitterness worse than gall,\n  Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\n  Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish koboo\n      call'd the ordure of humanity,\n  Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,\n  Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,\n  Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads\n      that inhabit them,\n  Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n       44\n  It is time to explain myself--let us stand up.\n\n  What is known I strip away,\n  I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\n  The clock indicates the moment--but what does eternity indicate?\n\n  We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\n  There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\n\n  Births have brought us richness and variety,\n  And other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\n  I do not call one greater and one smaller,\n  That which fills its period and place is equal to any.\n\n  Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?\n  I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\n  All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\n  (What have I to do with lamentation?)\n\n  I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things to be.\n\n  My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\n  On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,\n  All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.\n\n  Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\n  Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,\n  I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,\n  And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\n  Long I was hugg'd close--long and long.\n\n  Immense have been the preparations for me,\n  Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\n\n  Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,\n  For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\n  They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\n  Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\n  My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\n\n  For it the nebula cohered to an orb,\n  The long slow strata piled to rest it on,\n  Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,\n  Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it\n      with care.\n\n  All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,\n  Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n\n      45\n  O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!\n  O manhood, balanced, florid and full.\n\n  My lovers suffocate me,\n  Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\n  Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,\n  Crying by day, Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and\n      chirping over my head,\n  Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\n  Lighting on every moment of my life,\n  Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\n  Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.\n\n  Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!\n\n  Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows\n      after and out of itself,\n  And the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\n  I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\n  And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of\n      the farther systems.\n\n  Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\n  Outward and outward and forever outward.\n\n  My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\n  He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\n  And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.\n\n  There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\n  If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\n      were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\n      not avail the long run,\n  We should surely bring up again where we now stand,\n  And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\n\n  A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do\n      not hazard the span or make it impatient,\n  They are but parts, any thing is but a part.\n\n  See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\n  Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\n\n  My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\n  The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\n  The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.\n\n       46\n  I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and\n      never will be measured.\n\n  I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\n  My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,\n  No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\n  I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\n  I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\n  But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\n  My left hand hooking you round the waist,\n  My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.\n\n  Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\n  You must travel it for yourself.\n\n  It is not far, it is within reach,\n  Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,\n  Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\n  Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,\n  Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\n  If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand\n      on my hip,\n  And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\n  For after we start we never lie by again.\n\n  This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded heaven,\n  And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs,\n      and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we\n      be fill'd and satisfied then?\n  And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.\n\n  You are also asking me questions and I hear you,\n  I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\n\n  Sit a while dear son,\n  Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\n  But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you\n      with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.\n\n  Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,\n  Now I wash the gum from your eyes,\n  You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every\n      moment of your life.\n\n  Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\n  Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,\n  To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout,\n      and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n       47\n  I am the teacher of athletes,\n  He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,\n  He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\n\n  The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power,\n      but in his own right,\n  Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\n  Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\n  Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,\n  First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a\n      skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,\n  Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over\n      all latherers,\n  And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.\n\n  I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\n  I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\n  My words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\n  I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while\n      I wait for a boat,\n  (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,\n  Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)\n\n  I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,\n  And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her\n      who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\n  If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,\n  The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves key,\n  The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\n\n  No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,\n  But roughs and little children better than they.\n\n  The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\n  The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with\n      him all day,\n  The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,\n  In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen\n      and love them.\n\n  The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,\n  On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,\n  On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\n  My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his blanket,\n  The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\n  The young mother and old mother comprehend me,\n  The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,\n  They and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n       48\n  I have said that the soul is not more than the body,\n  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\n  And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,\n  And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own\n      funeral drest in his shroud,\n  And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,\n  And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the\n      learning of all times,\n  And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it\n      may become a hero,\n  And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,\n  And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed\n      before a million universes.\n\n  And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\n  For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,\n  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and\n      about death.)\n\n  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\n  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\n\n  Why should I wish to see God better than this day?\n  I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,\n  In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,\n  I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd\n      by God's name,\n  And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,\n  Others will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n       49\n  And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to\n      try to alarm me.\n\n  To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\n  I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\n  I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\n  And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\n\n  And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not\n      offend me,\n  I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\n  I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of melons.\n\n  And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,\n  (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\n  I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\n  O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,\n  If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\n  Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\n  Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,\n  Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay\n      in the muck,\n  Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\n  I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\n  I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,\n  And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\n\n       50\n  There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.\n\n  Wrench'd and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes,\n  I sleep--I sleep long.\n\n  I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,\n  It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\n\n  Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\n  To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\n\n  Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.\n\n  Do you see O my brothers and sisters?\n  It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal\n      life--it is Happiness.\n\n       51\n  The past and present wilt--I have fill'd them, emptied them.\n  And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\n\n  Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?\n  Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\n  (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)\n\n  Do I contradict myself?\n  Very well then I contradict myself,\n  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\n  I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\n\n  Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?\n  Who wishes to walk with me?\n\n  Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?\n\n       52\n  The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab\n      and my loitering.\n\n  I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\n  I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\n  The last scud of day holds back for me,\n  It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds,\n  It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\n\n  I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\n  I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\n\n  I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\n  If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n\n  You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\n  But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\n  And filter and fibre your blood.\n\n  Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\n  Missing me one place search another,\n  I stop somewhere waiting for you.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.  CHILDREN OF ADAM\n\n\nTo the Garden the World\n\n  To the garden the world anew ascending,\n  Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,\n  The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,\n  Curious here behold my resurrection after slumber,\n  The revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again,\n  Amorous, mature, all beautiful to me, all wondrous,\n  My limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them, for\n      reasons, most wondrous,\n  Existing I peer and penetrate still,\n  Content with the present, content with the past,\n  By my side or back of me Eve following,\n  Or in front, and I following her just the same.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Pent-Up Aching Rivers\n\n  From pent-up aching rivers,\n  From that of myself without which I were nothing,\n  From what I am determin'd to make illustrious, even if I stand sole\n      among men,\n  From my own voice resonant, singing the phallus,\n  Singing the song of procreation,\n  Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people,\n  Singing the muscular urge and the blending,\n  Singing the bedfellow's song, (O resistless yearning!\n  O for any and each the body correlative attracting!\n  O for you whoever you are your correlative body! O it, more than all\n      else, you delighting!)\n  From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day,\n  From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,\n  Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it\n      many a long year,\n  Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,\n  Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,\n  Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems informing,\n  Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,\n  Of the wet of woods, of the lapping of waves,\n  Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land, I them chanting,\n  The overture lightly sounding, the strain anticipating,\n  The welcome nearness, the sight of the perfect body,\n  The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his back\n      lying and floating,\n  The female form approaching, I pensive, love-flesh tremulous aching,\n  The divine list for myself or you or for any one making,\n  The face, the limbs, the index from head to foot, and what it arouses,\n  The mystic deliria, the madness amorous, the utter abandonment,\n  (Hark close and still what I now whisper to you,\n  I love you, O you entirely possess me,\n  O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off, free and lawless,\n  Two hawks in the air, two fishes swimming in the sea not more\n      lawless than we;)\n  The furious storm through me careering, I passionately trembling.\n  The oath of the inseparableness of two together, of the woman that\n      loves me and whom I love more than my life, that oath swearing,\n  (O I willingly stake all for you,\n  O let me be lost if it must be so!\n  O you and I! what is it to us what the rest do or think?\n  What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other and exhaust\n      each other if it must be so;)\n  From the master, the pilot I yield the vessel to,\n  The general commanding me, commanding all, from him permission taking,\n  From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter'd too long as it is,)\n  From sex, from the warp and from the woof,\n  From privacy, from frequent repinings alone,\n  From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near,\n  From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers\n      through my hair and beard,\n  From the long sustain'd kiss upon the mouth or bosom,\n  From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting\n      with excess,\n  From what the divine husband knows, from the work of fatherhood,\n  From exultation, victory and relief, from the bedfellow's embrace in\n      the night,\n  From the act-poems of eyes, hands, hips and bosoms,\n  From the cling of the trembling arm,\n  From the bending curve and the clinch,\n  From side by side the pliant coverlet off-throwing,\n  From the one so unwilling to have me leave, and me just as unwilling\n      to leave,\n  (Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)\n  From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,\n  From the night a moment I emerging flitting out,\n  Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for,\n  And you stalwart loins.\n\n\n\n\nI Sing the Body Electric\n\n       1\n  I sing the body electric,\n  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,\n  They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,\n  And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.\n\n  Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?\n  And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?\n  And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?\n  And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?\n\n       2\n  The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself\n      balks account,\n  That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\n\n  The expression of the face balks account,\n  But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,\n  It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of\n      his hips and wrists,\n  It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist\n      and knees, dress does not hide him,\n  The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,\n  To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,\n  You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\n\n  The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the\n      folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the\n      contour of their shape downwards,\n  The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through\n      the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls\n      silently to and from the heave of the water,\n  The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the\n      horse-man in his saddle,\n  Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\n  The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open\n      dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,\n  The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the garden or\n      cow-yard,\n  The young fellow hosing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six\n      horses through the crowd,\n  The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,\n      good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,\n  The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\n  The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\n  The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine\n      muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\n  The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes\n      suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,\n  The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd\n      neck and the counting;\n  Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's\n      breast with the little child,\n  Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with\n      the firemen, and pause, listen, count.\n\n       3\n  I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,\n  And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.\n\n  This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,\n  The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and\n      beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness\n      and breadth of his manners,\n  These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,\n  He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were\n      massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,\n  They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,\n  They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,\n  He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the\n      clear-brown skin of his face,\n  He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, he\n      had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had\n      fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,\n  When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,\n      you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,\n  You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit\n      by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.\n\n       4\n  I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,\n  To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\n  To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\n  To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly\n      round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?\n  I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.\n\n  There is something in staying close to men and women and looking\n      on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,\n  All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.\n\n       5\n  This is the female form,\n  A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,\n  It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,\n  I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor,\n      all falls aside but myself and it,\n  Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what\n      was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed,\n  Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response\n      likewise ungovernable,\n  Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all\n      diffused, mine too diffused,\n  Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling\n      and deliciously aching,\n  Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of\n      love, white-blow and delirious nice,\n  Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,\n  Undulating into the willing and yielding day,\n  Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.\n\n  This the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,\n  This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the\n      outlet again.\n\n  Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the\n      exit of the rest,\n  You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\n\n  The female contains all qualities and tempers them,\n  She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,\n  She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,\n  She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\n\n  As I see my soul reflected in Nature,\n  As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,\n      sanity, beauty,\n  See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.\n\n       6\n  The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,\n  He too is all qualities, he is action and power,\n  The flush of the known universe is in him,\n  Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,\n  The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is\n      utmost become him well, pride is for him,\n  The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\n  Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to\n      the test of himself,\n  Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes\n      soundings at last only here,\n  (Where else does he strike soundings except here?)\n\n  The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred,\n  No matter who it is, it is sacred--is it the meanest one in the\n      laborers' gang?\n  Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?\n  Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as\n      much as you,\n  Each has his or her place in the procession.\n\n  (All is a procession,\n  The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)\n\n  Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?\n  Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has\n      no right to a sight?\n  Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and\n      the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,\n  For you only, and not for him and her?\n\n       7\n  A man's body at auction,\n  (For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)\n  I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.\n\n  Gentlemen look on this wonder,\n  Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,\n  For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one\n      animal or plant,\n  For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.\n\n  In this head the all-baffling brain,\n  In it and below it the makings of heroes.\n\n  Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in\n      tendon and nerve,\n  They shall be stript that you may see them.\n\n  Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,\n  Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby,\n      good-sized arms and legs,\n  And wonders within there yet.\n\n  Within there runs blood,\n  The same old blood! the same red-running blood!\n  There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires,\n      reachings, aspirations,\n  (Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in\n      parlors and lecture-rooms?)\n\n  This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be\n      fathers in their turns,\n  In him the start of populous states and rich republics,\n  Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.\n\n  How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring\n      through the centuries?\n  (Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace\n      back through the centuries?)\n\n       8\n  A woman's body at auction,\n  She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,\n  She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.\n\n  Have you ever loved the body of a woman?\n  Have you ever loved the body of a man?\n  Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations\n      and times all over the earth?\n\n  If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,\n  And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,\n  And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more\n      beautiful than the most beautiful face.\n\n  Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool\n      that corrupted her own live body?\n  For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.\n\n       9\n  O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and\n      women, nor the likes of the parts of you,\n  I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of\n      the soul, (and that they are the soul,)\n  I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and\n      that they are my poems,\n  Man's, woman's, child, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's,\n      father's, young man's, young woman's poems,\n  Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,\n  Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or\n      sleeping of the lids,\n  Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges,\n  Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,\n  Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue,\n  Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the\n      ample side-round of the chest,\n  Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,\n  Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger,\n      finger-joints, finger-nails,\n  Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side,\n  Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,\n  Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round,\n      man-balls, man-root,\n  Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,\n  Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg,\n  Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;\n  All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your\n      body or of any one's body, male or female,\n  The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,\n  The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,\n  Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,\n  Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman,\n  The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping,\n      love-looks, love-perturbations and risings,\n  The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,\n  Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,\n  Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening,\n  The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,\n  The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair,\n  The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked\n      meat of the body,\n  The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out,\n  The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward\n      toward the knees,\n  The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the\n      marrow in the bones,\n  The exquisite realization of health;\n  O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul,\n  O I say now these are the soul!\n\n\n\n\nA Woman Waits for Me\n\n  A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking,\n  Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the\n      right man were lacking.\n\n  Sex contains all, bodies, souls,\n  Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,\n  Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,\n  All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves,\n      beauties, delights of the earth,\n  All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,\n  These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.\n\n  Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,\n  Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.\n\n  Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,\n  I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that\n      are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,\n  I see that they understand me and do not deny me,\n  I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of\n      those women.\n\n  They are not one jot less than I am,\n  They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,\n  Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,\n  They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike,\n      retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,\n  They are ultimate in their own right--they are calm, clear,\n      well-possess'd of themselves.\n\n  I draw you close to me, you women,\n  I cannot let you go, I would do you good,\n  I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for\n      others' sakes,\n  Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,\n  They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.\n\n  It is I, you women, I make my way,\n  I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,\n  I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,\n  I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I\n      press with slow rude muscle,\n  I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,\n  I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.\n\n  Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,\n  In you I wrap a thousand onward years,\n  On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,\n  The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls,\n      new artists, musicians, and singers,\n  The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,\n  I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,\n  I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you\n      inter-penetrate now,\n  I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I\n      count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,\n  I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death,\n      immortality, I plant so lovingly now.\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous Me\n\n  Spontaneous me, Nature,\n  The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am happy with,\n  The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,\n  The hillside whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain ash,\n  The same late in autumn, the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple, and\n      light and dark green,\n  The rich coverlet of the grass, animals and birds, the private\n      untrimm'd bank, the primitive apples, the pebble-stones,\n  Beautiful dripping fragments, the negligent list of one after\n      another as I happen to call them to me or think of them,\n  The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,)\n  The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me,\n  This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and that all\n      men carry,\n  (Know once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like me, are\n      our lusty lurking masculine poems,)\n  Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding, love-climbers,\n      and the climbing sap,\n  Arms and hands of love, lips of love, phallic thumb of love, breasts\n      of love, bellies press'd and glued together with love,\n  Earth of chaste love, life that is only life after love,\n  The body of my love, the body of the woman I love, the body of the\n      man, the body of the earth,\n  Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west,\n  The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and down, that gripes the\n      full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes\n      his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is\n      satisfied;\n  The wet of woods through the early hours,\n  Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with\n      an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,\n  The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage-plant, mint, birch-bark,\n  The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what\n      he was dreaming,\n  The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and\n      content to the ground,\n  The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,\n  The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any\n      one,\n  The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged\n      feelers may be intimate where they are,\n  The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the bashful\n      withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and\n      edge themselves,\n  The limpid liquid within the young man,\n  The vex'd corrosion so pensive and so painful,\n  The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,\n  The like of the same I feel, the like of the same in others,\n  The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that\n      flushes and flushes,\n  The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to\n      repress what would master him,\n  The mystic amorous night, the strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats,\n  The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers,\n      the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry;\n  The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,\n  The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the\n      sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,\n  The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen'd\n      long-round walnuts,\n  The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,\n  The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent,\n      while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent,\n  The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity,\n  The oath of procreation I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh daughters,\n  The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate\n      what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through,\n  The wholesome relief, repose, content,\n  And this bunch pluck'd at random from myself,\n  It has done its work--I toss it carelessly to fall where it may.\n\n\n\n\nOne Hour to Madness and Joy\n\n  One hour to madness and joy! O furious! O confine me not!\n  (What is this that frees me so in storms?\n  What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?)\n  O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!\n  O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath them to you my children,\n  I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)\n\n  O to be yielded to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me\n      in defiance of the world!\n  O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!\n  O to draw you to me, to plant on you for the first time the lips of\n      a determin'd man.\n\n  O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep and dark pool, all\n      untied and illumin'd!\n  O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!\n  To be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions, I from mine and\n      you from yours!\n  To find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of Nature!\n  To have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!\n  To have the feeling to-day or any day I am sufficient as I am.\n\n  O something unprov'd! something in a trance!\n  To escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!\n  To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!\n  To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!\n  To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!\n  To rise thither with my inebriate soul!\n  To be lost if it must be so!\n  To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!\n  With one brief hour of madness and joy.\n\n\n\n\nOut of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd\n\n  Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,\n  Whispering I love you, before long I die,\n  I have travel'd a long way merely to look on you to touch you,\n  For I could not die till I once look'd on you,\n  For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.\n\n  Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe,\n  Return in peace to the ocean my love,\n  I too am part of that ocean my love, we are not so much separated,\n  Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect!\n  But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,\n  As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever;\n  Be not impatient--a little space--know you I salute the air, the\n      ocean and the land,\n  Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love.\n\n\n\n\nAges and Ages Returning at Intervals\n\n  Ages and ages returning at intervals,\n  Undestroy'd, wandering immortal,\n  Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly sweet,\n  I, chanter of Adamic songs,\n  Through the new garden the West, the great cities calling,\n  Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these, offering myself,\n  Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex,\n  Offspring of my loins.\n\n\n\n\nWe Two, How Long We Were Fool'd\n\n  We two, how long we were fool'd,\n  Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,\n  We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,\n  We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,\n  We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,\n  We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,\n  We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any,\n  We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,\n  We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes mornings\n      and evenings,\n  We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,\n  We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down,\n  We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic\n      and stellar, we are as two comets,\n  We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods, we spring on prey,\n  We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead,\n  We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling\n      over each other and interwetting each other,\n  We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious, impervious,\n  We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and influence\n      of the globe,\n  We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two,\n  We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.\n\n\n\n\nO Hymen! O Hymenee!\n\n  O hymen! O hymenee! why do you tantalize me thus?\n  O why sting me for a swift moment only?\n  Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?\n  Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would\n      soon certainly kill me?\n\n\n\n\nI Am He That Aches with Love\n\n  I am he that aches with amorous love;\n  Does the earth gravitate? does not all matter, aching, attract all matter?\n  So the body of me to all I meet or know.\n\n\n\n\nNative Moments\n\n  Native moments--when you come upon me--ah you are here now,\n  Give me now libidinous joys only,\n  Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank,\n  To-day I go consort with Nature's darlings, to-night too,\n  I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight\n      orgies of young men,\n  I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers,\n  The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person\n      for my dearest friend,\n  He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn'd by\n      others for deeds done,\n  I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my companions?\n  O you shunn'd persons, I at least do not shun you,\n  I come forthwith in your midst, I will be your poet,\n  I will be more to you than to any of the rest.\n\n\n\n\nOnce I Pass'd Through a Populous City\n\n  Once I pass'd through a populous city imprinting my brain for future\n      use with its shows, architecture, customs, traditions,\n  Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met\n      there who detain'd me for love of me,\n  Day by day and night by night we were together--all else has long\n      been forgotten by me,\n  I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me,\n  Again we wander, we love, we separate again,\n  Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,\n  I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.\n\n\n\n\nI Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ\n\n  I heard you solemn-sweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn I\n      pass'd the church,\n  Winds of autumn, as I walk'd the woods at dusk I heard your long-\n      stretch'd sighs up above so mournful,\n  I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera, I heard the\n      soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;\n  Heart of my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one of the\n      wrists around my head,\n  Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last\n      night under my ear.\n\n\n\n\nFacing West from California's Shores\n\n  Facing west from California's shores,\n  Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,\n  I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,\n      the land of migrations, look afar,\n  Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;\n  For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,\n  From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,\n  From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,\n  Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,\n  Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,\n  (But where is what I started for so long ago?\n  And why is it yet unfound?)\n\n\n\n\nAs Adam Early in the Morning\n\n  As Adam early in the morning,\n  Walking forth from the bower refresh'd with sleep,\n  Behold me where I pass, hear my voice, approach,\n  Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass,\n  Be not afraid of my body.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V.  CALAMUS\n\n\nIn Paths Untrodden\n\n  In paths untrodden,\n  In the growth by margins of pond-waters,\n  Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,\n  From all the standards hitherto publish'd, from the pleasures,\n      profits, conformities,\n  Which too long I was offering to feed my soul,\n  Clear to me now standards not yet publish'd, clear to me that my soul,\n  That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades,\n  Here by myself away from the clank of the world,\n  Tallying and talk'd to here by tongues aromatic,\n  No longer abash'd, (for in this secluded spot I can respond as I\n      would not dare elsewhere,)\n  Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains\n      all the rest,\n  Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of manly attachment,\n  Projecting them along that substantial life,\n  Bequeathing hence types of athletic love,\n  Afternoon this delicious Ninth-month in my forty-first year,\n  I proceed for all who are or have been young men,\n  To tell the secret my nights and days,\n  To celebrate the need of comrades.\n\n\n\n\nScented Herbage of My Breast\n\n  Scented herbage of my breast,\n  Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best afterwards,\n  Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death,\n  Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you\n      delicate leaves,\n  Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired you\n      shall emerge again;\n  O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale\n      your faint odor, but I believe a few will;\n  O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell in\n      your own way of the heart that is under you,\n  O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you are\n      not happiness,\n  You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me,\n  Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots, you make me\n      think of death,\n  Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful\n      except death and love?)\n  O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers,\n      I think it must be for death,\n  For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers,\n  Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,\n  (I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)\n  Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as\n      you mean,\n  Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast!\n  Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!\n  Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!\n  Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!\n  Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I have\n      long enough stifled and choked;\n  Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not,\n  I will say what I have to say by itself,\n  I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a\n      call only their call,\n  I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,\n  I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will\n      through the States,\n  Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,\n  Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,\n  Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and\n      are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,\n  Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,\n  For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,\n  That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that\n      they are mainly for you,\n  That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,\n  That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,\n  That you will one day perhaps take control of all,\n  That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,\n  That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,\n  But you will last very long.\n\n\n\n\nWhoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand\n\n  Whoever you are holding me now in hand,\n  Without one thing all will be useless,\n  I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,\n  I am not what you supposed, but far different.\n\n  Who is he that would become my follower?\n  Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?\n\n  The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,\n  You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your\n      sole and exclusive standard,\n  Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,\n  The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives\n      around you would have to be abandon'd,\n  Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let\n      go your hand from my shoulders,\n  Put me down and depart on your way.\n\n  Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,\n  Or back of a rock in the open air,\n  (For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,\n  And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)\n  But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any\n      person for miles around approach unawares,\n  Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or\n      some quiet island,\n  Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,\n  With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's kiss,\n  For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.\n\n  Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,\n  Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,\n  Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;\n  For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,\n  And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.\n\n  But these leaves conning you con at peril,\n  For these leaves and me you will not understand,\n  They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will\n      certainly elude you.\n  Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!\n  Already you see I have escaped from you.\n\n  For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,\n  Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,\n  Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,\n  Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few)\n      prove victorious,\n  Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil,\n      perhaps more,\n  For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times\n      and not hit, that which I hinted at;\n  Therefore release me and depart on your way.\n\n\n\n\nFor You, O Democracy\n\n  Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,\n  I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,\n  I will make divine magnetic lands,\n       With the love of comrades,\n         With the life-long love of comrades.\n\n  I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America,\n      and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,\n  I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's necks,\n       By the love of comrades,\n         By the manly love of comrades.\n\n  For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!\n  For you, for you I am trilling these songs.\n\n\n\n\nThese I Singing in Spring\n\n  These I singing in spring collect for lovers,\n  (For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy?\n  And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)\n  Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass the gates,\n  Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,\n  Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown there,\n      pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,\n  (Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and\n      partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)\n  Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I\n      think where I go,\n  Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,\n  Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,\n  Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,\n  They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a\n      great crowd, and I in the middle,\n  Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,\n  Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,\n  Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,\n  Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a live-oak in\n      Florida as it hung trailing down,\n  Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,\n  And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,\n  (O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again\n      never to separate from me,\n  And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this\n      calamus-root shall,\n  Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)\n  And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,\n  And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,\n  These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,\n  Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,\n  Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each;\n  But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,\n  I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable\n      of loving.\n\n\n\n\nNot Heaving from My Ribb'd Breast Only\n\n  Not heaving from my ribb'd breast only,\n  Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself,\n  Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs,\n  Not in many an oath and promise broken,\n  Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition,\n  Not in the subtle nourishment of the air,\n  Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists,\n  Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease,\n  Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only,\n  Not in cries, laughter, defiancies, thrown from me when alone far in\n      the wilds,\n  Not in husky pantings through clinch'd teeth,\n  Not in sounded and resounded words, chattering words, echoes, dead words,\n  Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,\n  Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day,\n  Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you\n      continually--not there,\n  Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!\n  Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs.\n\n\n\n\nOf the Terrible Doubt of Appearances\n\n  Of the terrible doubt of appearances,\n  Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,\n  That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,\n  That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,\n  May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills,\n      shining and flowing waters,\n  The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these\n      are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real\n      something has yet to be known,\n  (How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me!\n  How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them,)\n  May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem)\n      as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they\n      would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely\n      changed points of view;\n  To me these and the like of these are curiously answer'd by my\n      lovers, my dear friends,\n  When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me\n      by the hand,\n  When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason\n      hold not, surround us and pervade us,\n  Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am silent, I\n      require nothing further,\n  I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity\n      beyond the grave,\n  But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,\n  He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.\n\n\n\n\nThe Base of All Metaphysics\n\n  And now gentlemen,\n  A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,\n  As base and finale too for all metaphysics.\n\n  (So to the students the old professor,\n  At the close of his crowded course.)\n\n  Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems,\n  Kant having studied and stated, Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,\n  Stated the lore of Plato, and Socrates greater than Plato,\n  And greater than Socrates sought and stated, Christ divine having\n      studied long,\n  I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems,\n  See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see,\n  Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ the divine I see,\n  The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to friend,\n  Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and parents,\n  Of city for city and land for land.\n\n\n\n\nRecorders Ages Hence\n\n  Recorders ages hence,\n  Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I\n      will tell you what to say of me,\n  Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,\n  The friend the lover's portrait, of whom his friend his lover was fondest,\n  Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love\n      within him, and freely pour'd it forth,\n  Who often walk'd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,\n  Who pensive away from one he lov'd often lay sleepless and\n      dissatisfied at night,\n  Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might\n      secretly be indifferent to him,\n  Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on hills,\n      he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain apart from other men,\n  Who oft as he saunter'd the streets curv'd with his arm the shoulder\n      of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon him also.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I Heard at the Close of the Day\n\n  When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd\n      with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for\n      me that follow'd,\n  And else when I carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, still\n      I was not happy,\n  But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,\n      refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,\n  When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the\n      morning light,\n  When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,\n      laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,\n  And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way\n      coming, O then I was happy,\n  O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food\n      nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,\n  And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came\n      my friend,\n  And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly\n      continually up the shores,\n  I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me\n      whispering to congratulate me,\n  For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in\n      the cool night,\n  In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,\n  And his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night I was happy.\n\n\n\n\nAre You the New Person Drawn Toward Me?\n\n  Are you the new person drawn toward me?\n  To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose;\n  Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?\n  Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?\n  Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd satisfaction?\n  Do you think I am trusty and faithful?\n  Do you see no further than this facade, this smooth and tolerant\n      manner of me?\n  Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man?\n  Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?\n\n\n\n\nRoots and Leaves Themselves Alone\n\n  Roots and leaves themselves alone are these,\n  Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond-side,\n  Breast-sorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter\n      than vines,\n  Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the\n      sun is risen,\n  Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living\n      sea, to you O sailors!\n  Frost-mellow'd berries and Third-month twigs offer'd fresh to young\n      persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,\n  Love-buds put before you and within you whoever you are,\n  Buds to be unfolded on the old terms,\n  If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring\n      form, color, perfume, to you,\n  If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers,\n      fruits, tall branches and trees.\n\n\n\n\nNot Heat Flames Up and Consumes\n\n  Not heat flames up and consumes,\n  Not sea-waves hurry in and out,\n  Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly\n      along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,\n  Waited, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;\n  Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consuming,\n      burning for his love whom I love,\n  O none more than I hurrying in and out;\n  Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the same,\n  O nor down-balls nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds,\n      are borne through the open air,\n  Any more than my soul is borne through the open air,\n  Wafted in all directions O love, for friendship, for you.\n\n\n\n\nTrickle Drops\n\n  Trickle drops! my blue veins leaving!\n  O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,\n  Candid from me falling, drip, bleeding drops,\n  From wounds made to free you whence you were prison'd,\n  From my face, from my forehead and lips,\n  From my breast, from within where I was conceal'd, press forth red\n      drops, confession drops,\n  Stain every page, stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops,\n  Let them know your scarlet heat, let them glisten,\n  Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet,\n  Glow upon all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops,\n  Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.\n\n\n\n\nCity of Orgies\n\n  City of orgies, walks and joys,\n  City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make\n  Not the pageants of you, not your shifting tableaus, your\n      spectacles, repay me,\n  Not the interminable rows of your houses, nor the ships at the wharves,\n  Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows with\n      goods in them,\n  Nor to converse with learn'd persons, or bear my share in the soiree\n      or feast;\n  Not those, but as I pass O Manhattan, your frequent and swift flash\n      of eyes offering me love,\n  Offering response to my own--these repay me,\n  Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me.\n\n\n\n\nBehold This Swarthy Face\n\n  Behold this swarthy face, these gray eyes,\n  This beard, the white wool unclipt upon my neck,\n  My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm;\n  Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly\n      on the lips with robust love,\n  And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship's deck give a\n      kiss in return,\n  We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea,\n  We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.\n\n\n\n\nI Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing\n\n  I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,\n  All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,\n  Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green,\n  And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,\n  But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there\n      without its friend near, for I knew I could not,\n  And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and\n      twined around it a little moss,\n  And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,\n  It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,\n  (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)\n  Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;\n  For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana\n      solitary in a wide in a wide flat space,\n  Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,\n  I know very well I could not.\n\n\n\n\nTo a Stranger\n\n  Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,\n  You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me\n      as of a dream,)\n  I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,\n  All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate,\n      chaste, matured,\n  You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,\n  I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours\n      only nor left my body mine only,\n  You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you\n      take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,\n  I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or\n      wake at night alone,\n  I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,\n  I am to see to it that I do not lose you.\n\n\n\n\nThis Moment Yearning and Thoughtful\n\n  This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,\n  It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful,\n  It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy,\n      France, Spain,\n  Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects,\n  And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become\n      attached to them as I do to men in my own lands,\n  O I know we should be brethren and lovers,\n  I know I should be happy with them.\n\n\n\n\nI Hear It Was Charged Against Me\n\n  I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions,\n  But really I am neither for nor against institutions,\n  (What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the\n      destruction of them?)\n  Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these\n      States inland and seaboard,\n  And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large\n      that dents the water,\n  Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,\n  The institution of the dear love of comrades.\n\n\n\n\nThe Prairie-Grass Dividing\n\n  The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,\n  I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,\n  Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,\n  Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,\n  Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,\n  Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and\n      command, leading not following,\n  Those with a never-quell'd audacity, those with sweet and lusty\n      flesh clear of taint,\n  Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,\n      as to say Who are you?\n  Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain'd, never obedient,\n  Those of inland America.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I Peruse the Conquer'd Fame\n\n  When I peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes and the victories of\n      mighty generals, I do not envy the generals,\n  Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house,\n  But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,\n  How together through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long\n      and long,\n  Through youth and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how\n      affectionate and faithful they were,\n  Then I am pensive--I hastily walk away fill'd with the bitterest envy.\n\n\n\n\nWe Two Boys Together Clinging\n\n  We two boys together clinging,\n  One the other never leaving,\n  Up and down the roads going, North and South excursions making,\n  Power enjoying, elbows stretching, fingers clutching,\n  Arm'd and fearless, eating, drinking, sleeping, loving.\n  No law less than ourselves owning, sailing, soldiering, thieving,\n      threatening,\n  Misers, menials, priests alarming, air breathing, water drinking, on\n      the turf or the sea-beach dancing,\n  Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chasing,\n  Fulfilling our foray.\n\n\n\n\nA Promise to California\n\n  A promise to California,\n  Or inland to the great pastoral Plains, and on to Puget sound and Oregon;\n  Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,\n      to teach robust American love,\n  For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you,\n      inland, and along the Western sea;\n  For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea, and I will also.\n\n\n\n\nHere the Frailest Leaves of Me\n\n  Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting,\n  Here I shade and hide my thoughts, I myself do not expose them,\n  And yet they expose me more than all my other poems.\n\n\n\n\nNo Labor-Saving Machine\n\n  No labor-saving machine,\n  Nor discovery have I made,\n  Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found\n      hospital or library,\n  Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America,\n  Nor literary success nor intellect; nor book for the book-shelf,\n  But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave,\n  For comrades and lovers.\n\n\n\n\nA Glimpse\n\n  A glimpse through an interstice caught,\n  Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove\n      late of a winter night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,\n  Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and\n      seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,\n  A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and\n      oath and smutty jest,\n  There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,\n      perhaps not a word.\n\n\n\n\nA Leaf for Hand in Hand\n\n  A leaf for hand in hand;\n  You natural persons old and young!\n  You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of\n      the Mississippi!\n  You friendly boatmen and mechanics! you roughs!\n  You twain! and all processions moving along the streets!\n  I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to\n      walk hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\nEarth, My Likeness\n\n  Earth, my likeness,\n  Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric there,\n  I now suspect that is not all;\n  I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth,\n  For an athlete is enamour'd of me, and I of him,\n  But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible\n      to burst forth,\n  I dare not tell it in words, not even in these songs.\n\n\n\n\nI Dream'd in a Dream\n\n  I dream'd in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the\n      whole of the rest of the earth,\n  I dream'd that was the new city of Friends,\n  Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest,\n  It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,\n  And in all their looks and words.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Think You I Take My Pen in Hand?\n\n  What think you I take my pen in hand to record?\n  The battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw pass the\n      offing to-day under full sail?\n  The splendors of the past day? or the splendor of the night that\n      envelops me?\n  Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me? --no;\n  But merely of two simple men I saw to-day on the pier in the midst\n      of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends,\n  The one to remain hung on the other's neck and passionately kiss'd him,\n  While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms.\n\n\n\n\nTo the East and to the West\n\n  To the East and to the West,\n  To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania,\n  To the Kanadian of the north, to the Southerner I love,\n  These with perfect trust to depict you as myself, the germs are in all men,\n  I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb\n      friendship, exalte, previously unknown,\n  Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in all men.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes with One I Love\n\n  Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse\n      unreturn'd love,\n  But now I think there is no unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one\n      way or another,\n  (I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd,\n  Yet out of that I have written these songs.)\n\n\n\n\nTo a Western Boy\n\n  Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine;\n  Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins,\n  If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers,\n  Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine?\n\n\n\n\nFast Anchor'd Eternal O Love!\n\n  Fast-anchor'd eternal O love! O woman I love!\n  O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of you!\n  Then separate, as disembodied or another born,\n  Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,\n  I ascend, I float in the regions of your love O man,\n  O sharer of my roving life.\n\n\n\n\nAmong the Multitude\n\n  Among the men and women the multitude,\n  I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,\n  Acknowledging none else, not parent, wife, husband, brother, child,\n      any nearer than I am,\n  Some are baffled, but that one is not--that one knows me.\n\n  Ah lover and perfect equal,\n  I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections,\n  And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you.\n\n\n\n\nO You Whom I Often and Silently Come\n\n  O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you,\n  As I walk by your side or sit near, or remain in the same room with you,\n  Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is\n      playing within me.\n\n\n\n\nThat Shadow My Likeness\n\n  That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood,\n      chattering, chaffering,\n  How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits,\n  How often I question and doubt whether that is really me;\n  But among my lovers and caroling these songs,\n  O I never doubt whether that is really me.\n\n\n\n\nFull of Life Now\n\n  Full of life now, compact, visible,\n  I, forty years old the eighty-third year of the States,\n  To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence,\n  To you yet unborn these, seeking you.\n\n  When you read these I that was visible am become invisible,\n  Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me,\n  Fancying how happy you were if I could be with you and become your comrade;\n  Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now with you.)\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI\n\n\nSalut au Monde!\n\n       1\n  O take my hand Walt Whitman!\n  Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!\n  Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next,\n  Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.\n\n  What widens within you Walt Whitman?\n  What waves and soils exuding?\n  What climes? what persons and cities are here?\n  Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?\n  Who are the girls? who are the married women?\n  Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about\n      each other's necks?\n  What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\n  What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?\n  What myriads of dwellings are they fill'd with dwellers?\n\n       2\n  Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,\n  Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the west,\n  Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\n  Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends,\n  Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings, it\n      does not set for months,\n  Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above\n      the horizon and sinks again,\n  Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,\n  Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\n\n

twos and threes, fasten'd together\n      with wrist-chains and ankle-chains,\n  I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,\n  I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of\n      the Romans,\n  I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful\n      God the Christ,\n  I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars,\n      adages, transmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote three\n      thousand years ago.\n\n       4\n  What do you see Walt Whitman?\n  Who are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?\n  I see a great round wonder rolling through space,\n  I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, graveyards, jails, factories,\n      palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads upon the surface,\n  I see the shaded part on one side where the sleepers are sleeping,\n      and the sunlit part on the other side,\n  I see the curious rapid change of the light and shade,\n  I see distant lands, as

mariners of the world,\n  Some are in storms, some in the night with the watch on the lookout,\n  Some drifting helplessly, some with contagious diseases.\n\n  I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in\n      port, some on their voyages,\n  Some double the cape of Storms, some cape Verde, others capes\n      Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore,\n  Others Dondra head, others pass

in Europe,\n  I see them in Asia and in Africa.\n\n  I see the electric telegraphs of the earth,\n  I see the filaments of the news of the wars, deaths, losses, gains,\n      passions, of my race.\n\n

strong divine young man the Hercules toil'd\n      faithfully and long and then died,\n  I see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate of the\n      beautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd Bacchus,\n  I see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers on\n      his head,\n  I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-belov'd, saying to the people\n      Do not weep for me,\n  This is not my true country, I have lived banish'd from my true\n      country, I now go back there,\n  I return to the celestial sphere where every one goes in his turn.\n\n       7\n  I see the battle-fields of the earth, grass grows upon them and\n      blossoms and corn,\n  I see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.\n\n  I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the unknown\n      events, heroes, records of the earth.\n\n  I see the places of the sagas,\n  I see pine-trees and fir-trees torn by northern blasts,\n  I see granite bowlders and cliffs, I see green meadows and lakes,\n  I see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian warriors,\n  I see them raised high with stones by the marge of restless oceans,\n      that the dead men's spirits when they wearied of their quiet\n      graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the tossing\n      billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity, liberty, action.\n\n  I see the steppes of Asia,\n

   dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks,\n  I see at Memphis mummy-pits containing mummies embalm'd,\n      swathed in linen cloth, lying there many centuries,\n  I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the\n      side-drooping neck, the hands folded across the breast.\n\n  I see all the menials of the earth, laboring,\n  I see all the prisoners in the prisons,\n  I see the defective human bodies of the earth,\n  The blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks, lunatics,\n  The pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-makers of the earth,\n  The helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women.\n\n  I see male and female everywhere,\n  I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs,\n  I see the constructiveness of my race,\n  I see the results of the perseverance and industry of my race,\n  I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, I go among them, I\n      mix indiscriminately,\n  And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.\n\n

VII\n\n\nSong of the Open Road\n\n       1\n  Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\n  Healthy, free, the world before me,\n  The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\n\n  Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\n  Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\n  Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\n  Strong and content I travel the open road.\n\n  The earth, that is sufficient,\n  I do not want the constellations any nearer,\n  I know they are very well where they are,\n  I know they suffice for those who belong to them.\n\n  (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\n  I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\n  I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\n  I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)\n\n       2\n  You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\n      that is here,\n  I believe that much unseen is also here.\n\n  Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\n  The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the\n      illiterate person, are not denied;\n  The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the\n      drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\n  The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\n  The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\n      town, the return back from the town,\n  They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\n  None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\n\n       3\n  You air that serves me with breath to speak!\n  You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\n  You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\n  You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\n  I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.\n\n  You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\n  You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\n      side! you distant ships!\n  You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd facades! you roofs!\n  You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\n  You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\n  You doors and ascending steps! you arches!\n  You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\n  From all that has touch'd you I believe you have imparted to\n      yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\n  From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\n      and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\n\n       4\n  The earth expanding right hand and left hand,\n  The picture alive, every part in its best light,\n  The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is\n      not wanted,\n  The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road.\n\n  O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me?\n  Do you say Venture not--if you leave me you are lost?\n  Do you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied,\n      adhere to me?\n\n  O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,\n  You express me better than I can express myself,\n  You shall be more to me than my poem.\n\n  I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all\n      free poems also,\n  I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,\n  I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever\n      beholds me shall like me,\n  I think whoever I see must be happy.\n\n       5\n  From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines,\n  Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,\n  Listening to others, considering well what they say,\n  Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\n  Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\n      would hold me.\n\n  I inhale great draughts of space,\n  The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\n\n  I am larger, better than I thought,\n  I did not know I held so much goodness.\n\n  All seems beautiful to me,\n  can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me\n      I would do the same to you,\n  I will recruit for myself and you as I go,\n  I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,\n  I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\n  Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,\n  Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\n\n       6\n  Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\n  Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it would not\n      astonish me.\n\n  Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,\n  It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\n\n  Here a great personal deed has room,\n  (Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,\n  Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\n      authority and all argument against it.)\n\n  Here is the test of wisdom,\n  Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,\n  Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not having it,\n  Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\n  Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\n  Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\n      excellence of things;\n  Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\n      it out of the soul.\n\n  Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,\n  They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\n      spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\n\n  Here is realization,\n  Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\n  The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\n      are vacant of them.\n\n  Only the kernel of every object nourishes;\n  Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\n  Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\n\n  Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is apropos;\n  Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\n  Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\n\n       7\n  Here is the efflux of the soul,\n  The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd gates,\n      ever provoking questions,\n  These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\n  Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\n      expands my blood?\n  Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\n  Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\n      thoughts descend upon me?\n  (I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\n      drop fruit as I pass;)\n  What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\n  What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\n  What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\n      and pause?\n  What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's good-will? what\n      gives them to be free to mine?\n\n       8\n  The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\n  I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\n  Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\n\n  Here rises the fluid and attaching character,\n  The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\n      man and woman,\n  (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\n      out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\n      continually out of itself.)\n\n  Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\n      love of young and old,\n  From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\n  Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\n\n       9\n  Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!\n  Traveling with me you find what never tires.\n\n  The earth never tires,\n  The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude\n      and incomprehensible at first,\n  Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop'd,\n  I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\n\n  Allons! we must not stop here,\n  However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling\n      we cannot remain here,\n  However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters we must\n      not anchor here,\n  However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted\n      to receive it but a little while.\n\n       10\n  Allons! the inducements shall be greater,\n  We will sail pathless and wild seas,\n  We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper\n      speeds by under full sail.\n\n  Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,\n  Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;\n  Allons! from all formules!\n  From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.\n\n  The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.\n\n  Allons! yet take warning!\n  He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,\n  None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,\n  Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,\n  Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,\n  No diseas'd person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here.\n\n  (I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,\n  We convince by our presence.)\n\n       11\n  Listen! I will be honest with you,\n  I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,\n  These are the days that must happen to you:\n  You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,\n  You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,\n  You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you hardly\n      settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call'd by an\n      irresistible call to depart,\n  You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those\n      who remain behind you,\n  What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with\n      passionate kisses of parting,\n  You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands\n      toward you.\n\n       12\n  Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!\n  They too are on the road--they are the swift and majestic men--they\n      are the greatest women,\n  Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,\n  Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,\n  Habitues of many distant countries, habitues of far-distant dwellings,\n  Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,\n  Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,\n  Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of\n      children, bearers of children,\n  Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins,\n  Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious\n      years each emerging from that which preceded it,\n  Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases,\n  Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,\n  Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded\n      and well-grain'd manhood,\n  Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,\n  Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,\n  Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe,\n  Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.\n\n       13\n  Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,\n  To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,\n  To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights\n      they tend to,\n  Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,\n  To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,\n  To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it,\n  To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you,\n      however long but it stretches and waits for you,\n  To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,\n  To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without\n      labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one\n      particle of it,\n  To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant\n      villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and\n      the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,\n  To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,\n  To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,\n  To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter\n      them, to gather the love out of their hearts,\n  To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave\n      them behind you,\n  To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for\n      traveling souls.\n\n  All parts away for the progress of souls,\n  All religion, all solid things, arts, governments--all that was or is\n      apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners\n      before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.\n\n  Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of\n      the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance.\n\n  Forever alive, forever forward,\n  Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,\n      dissatisfied,\n  Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,\n  They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go,\n  But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great.\n\n  Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!\n  You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though\n      you built it, or though it has been built for you.\n\n  Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!\n  It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.\n\n  Behold through you as bad as the rest,\n  Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,\n  Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces,\n  Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.\n\n  No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,\n  Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,\n  Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and\n      bland in the parlors,\n  In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,\n  Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom,\n      everywhere,\n  Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the\n      breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,\n  Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers,\n  Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,\n  Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.\n\n       14\n  Allons! through struggles and wars!\n  The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.\n\n  Have the past struggles succeeded?\n  What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?\n  Now understand me well--it is provided in the essence of things that\n      from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth\n      something to make a greater struggle necessary.\n\n  My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,\n  He going with me must go well arm'd,\n  He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies,\n      desertions.\n\n       15\n  Allons! the road is before us!\n  It is safe--I have tried it--my own feet have tried it well--be not\n      detain'd!\n  Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the\n      shelf unopen'd!\n  Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd!\n  Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!\n  Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the\n      court, and the judge expound the law.\n\n  Camerado, I give you my hand!\n  I give you my love more precious than money,\n  I give you myself before preaching or law;\n  Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?\n  Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII\n\n\nCrossing Brooklyn Ferry\n\n       1\n  Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!\n  Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face\n      to face.\n\n  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious\n      you are to me!\n  On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning\n      home, are more curious to me than you suppose,\n  And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more\n      to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\n\n       2\n  The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\n  The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every\n      one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,\n  The similitudes of the past and those of the future,\n  The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on\n      the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\n  The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\n  The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\n  The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\n\n  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\n  Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,\n  Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the\n      heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\n  Others will see the islands large and small;\n  Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half\n      an hour high,\n  A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others\n      will see them,\n  Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the\n      falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\n\n       3\n  It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,\n  I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many\n      generations hence,\n  Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,\n  Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,\n  Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the\n      bright flow, I was refresh'd,\n  Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift\n      current, I stood yet was hurried,\n  Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the\n      thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.\n\n  I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,\n  Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air\n      floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\n  Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left\n      the rest in strong shadow,\n  Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,\n  Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\n  Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\n  Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my\n      head in the sunlit water,\n  Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,\n  Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\n  Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,\n  Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\n  Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\n  The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,\n  The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender\n      serpentine pennants,\n  The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,\n  The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\n  The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\n  The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the\n      frolic-some crests and glistening,\n  The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the\n      granite storehouses by the docks,\n  On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on\n      each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\n  On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning\n      high and glaringly into the night,\n  Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow\n      light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\n\n       4\n  These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\n  I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\n  The men and women I saw were all near to me,\n  Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward\n      to them,\n  (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\n\n       5\n  What is it then between us?\n  What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\n  Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,\n  I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\n  I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the\n      waters around it,\n  I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\n  In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\n  In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\n  I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\n  I too had receiv'd identity by my body,\n  That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I\n      should be of my body.\n\n       6\n  It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\n  The dark threw its patches down upon me also,\n  The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,\n  My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\n  Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\n  I am he who knew what it was to be evil,\n  I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\n  Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,\n  Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\n  Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\n  The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.\n  The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\n\n  Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\n  Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\n  Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as\n      they saw me approaching or passing,\n  Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of\n      their flesh against me as I sat,\n  Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet\n      never told them a word,\n  Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\n  Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\n  The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\n  Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\n       7\n  Closer yet I approach you,\n  What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my\n      stores in advance,\n  I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.\n\n  Who was to know what should come home to me?\n  Who knows but I am enjoying this?\n  Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you\n      now, for all you cannot see me?\n\n       8\n  Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than\n      mast-hemm'd Manhattan?\n  River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?\n  The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the\n      twilight, and the belated lighter?\n  What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I\n      love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?\n  What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that\n      looks in my face?\n  Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\n\n  We understand then do we not?\n  What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\n  What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not\n      accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?\n\n       9\n  Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\n  Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!\n  Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the\n      men and women generations after me!\n  Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\n  Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\n  Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\n  Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\n  Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!\n  Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my\n      nighest name!\n  Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\n  Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one\n      makes it!\n  Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be\n      looking upon you;\n  Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet\n      haste with the hasting current;\n  Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\n  Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all\n      downcast eyes have time to take it from you!\n  Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any\n      one's head, in the sunlit water!\n  Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd\n      schooners, sloops, lighters!\n  Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!\n  Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at\n      nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\n  Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\n  You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\n  About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,\n  Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and\n      sufficient rivers,\n  Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\n  Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\n\n  You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,\n  We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,\n  Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,\n  We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,\n  We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,\n  You furnish your parts toward eternity,\n  Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IX\n\n\nSong of the Answerer\n\n       1\n  Now list to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,\n  To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me.\n\n  A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,\n  How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?\n  Tell him to send me the signs. And I stand before the young man\n      face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his\n      left hand in my right hand,\n  And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that\n      answers for all, and send these signs.\n\n  Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,\n  Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,\n  Him they immerse and he immerses them.\n\n  Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,\n      people, animals,\n  The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so\n      tell I my morning's romanza,)\n  All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,\n  The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,\n  The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he\n      domiciles there,\n  Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,\n      the ships in the offing,\n  The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.\n\n  He puts things in their attitudes,\n  He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,\n  He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and\n      sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest\n      never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.\n\n  He is the Answerer,\n  What can be answer'd he answers, and what cannot be answer'd he\n      shows how it cannot be answer'd.\n\n  A man is a summons and challenge,\n  (It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you\n      hear the ironical echoes?)\n\n  Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,\n      beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,\n  He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and\n      down also.\n\n  Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly\n      and gently and safely by day or by night,\n  He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of\n      hands on the knobs.\n\n  His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\n      universal than he is,\n  The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\n\n  Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\n  He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and\n      any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\n  One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees\n      how they join.\n\n  He says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President\n      at his levee,\n  And he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\n  And both understand him and know that his speech is right.\n\n  He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,\n  He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\n      Here is our equal appearing and new.\n\n  Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\n  And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\n      he has follow'd the sea,\n  And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\n  And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\n  No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\n      follow'd it,\n  No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\n      sisters there.\n\n  The English believe he comes of their English stock,\n  A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,\n      removed from none.\n\n  Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,\n  The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard\n      is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,\n  The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi\n      or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.\n\n  The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,\n  The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see\n      themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,\n  They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.\n\n       2\n  The indications and tally of time,\n  Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,\n  Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,\n  What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company\n      of singers, and their words,\n  The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark,\n      but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,\n  The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\n  His insight and power encircle things and the human race,\n  He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\n\n  The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\n  The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough, but rare\n      has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\n      of poems, the Answerer,\n  (Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd such a\n      day, for all its names.)\n\n  The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\n      names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\n  The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\n      sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\n      weird-singer, or something else.\n\n  All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\n  The words of true poems do not merely please,\n  The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\n  The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\n      and fathers,\n  The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\n\n  Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\n      rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\n  Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\n\n  The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\n  The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\n      these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\n\n  The words of the true poems give you more than poems,\n  They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\n      peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\n  They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\n  They do not seek beauty, they are sought,\n  Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\n      fain, love-sick.\n\n  They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\n  They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\n  Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\n      learn one of the meanings,\n  To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\n      rings and never be quiet again.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK X\n\n\nOur Old

Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering,\n  On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steamboats\n      wooding up,\n  Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys\n      of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke\n      and Delaware,\n  In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks the\n

by hunters,\n      rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his\n      fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--and I, plunging at the\n      hunters, corner'd and desperate,\n  In the

like to you?\n  Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you\n      also be eligible as I am?\n  How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect\n      bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XI\n\n\nA Song of Joys\n\n  O to make the most jubilant song!\n  Full of music--full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!\n  Full of common employments--full of grain and trees.\n\n  O for the voices of animals--O for the swiftness and balance of fishes!\n  O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!\n  O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!\n\n  O the joy of my spirit--it is uncaged--it darts like lightning!\n  It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,\n  I will have thousands of globes and all time.\n\n  O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!\n  To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle, the\n      laughing locomotive!\n  To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.\n\n  O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!\n  The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh\n      stillness of the woods,\n  The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through the forenoon.\n\n  O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!\n  The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool\n      gurgling by the ears and hair.\n\n  O the fireman's joys!\n  I hear the alarm at dead of night,\n  I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!\n  The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.\n\n  O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in\n      perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent.\n\n  O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul is\n      capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods.\n\n  O the mother's joys!\n  The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, the\n      patiently yielded life.\n\n  O the of increase, growth, recuperation,\n  The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.\n\n  O to go back to the place where I was born,\n  To hear the birds sing once more,\n  To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,\n  And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.\n\n  O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast,\n  To continue and be employ'd there all my life,\n  The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at low water,\n  The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;\n  I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,\n  Is the tide out? I Join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,\n  I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man;\n  In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot\n      on the ice--I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,\n  Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,\n      my brood of tough boys accompanying me,\n  My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no\n      one else so well as they love to be with me,\n  By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.\n\n  Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots\n      where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,)\n  O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row\n      just before sunrise toward the buoys,\n  I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are\n      desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert\n      wooden pegs in the 'oints of their pincers,\n\n  I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the shore,\n  There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'd\n      till their color becomes scarlet.\n\n  Another time mackerel-taking,\n  Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the\n      water for miles;\n  Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the\n      brown-faced crew;\n  Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with braced body,\n  My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the\n      coils of slender rope,\n  In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my\n      companions.\n\n  O boating on the rivers,\n  The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,\n  The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft\n      and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,\n  The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook\n      supper at evening.\n\n  (O something pernicious and dread!\n  Something far away from a puny and pious life!\n  Something unproved! something in a trance!\n  Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)\n\n  O to work in mines, or forging iron,\n  Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample\n      and shadow'd space,\n  The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.\n\n  O to resume the joys of the soldier!\n  To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer--to feel his sympathy!\n  To behold his calmness--to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!\n  To go to battle--to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!\n  To hear the crash of artillery--to see the glittering of the bayonets\n      and musket-barrels in the sun!\n\n  To see men fall and die and not complain!\n  To taste the savage taste of blood--to be so devilish!\n  To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.\n\n  O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!\n  I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me,\n  I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There--she blows!\n  Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest--we descend,\n      wild with excitement,\n  I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,\n  We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,\n      lethargic, basking,\n  I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his\n      vigorous arm;\n  O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,\n      running to windward, tows me,\n  Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,\n  I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the wound,\n  Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him fast,\n  As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and\n      narrower, swiftly cutting the water--I see him die,\n  He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then\n      falls flat and still in the bloody foam.\n\n  O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!\n  My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,\n  My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.\n\n  O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!\n  I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,\n  How clear is my mind--how all people draw nigh to me!\n  What attractions are these beyond any before?

out from the\n      ribs and throat,\n  To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,\n  To lead America--to quell America with a great tongue.\n\n  O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity through\n      materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them,\n  My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,\n      reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,\n  The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,\n  My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,\n  Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes\n      which finally see,\n  Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,\n      embraces, procreates.\n\n  O the farmer's joys!\n  Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,\n      Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!\n  To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,\n  To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,\n  To plough land in the spring for maize,\n  To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.\n\n  O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,\n  To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the shore.\n\n  O to realize space!\n  The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,\n  To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying\n      clouds, as one with them.\n\n  O the joy a manly self-hood!\n  To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or unknown,\n  To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,\n  To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,\n  To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,\n  To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth.\n\n  Knowist thou the excellent joys of youth?\n  Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face?\n  Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?\n  Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?\n  Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?\n\n  Yet O my soul supreme!\n  Knowist thou the joys of pensive thought?\n  Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?\n  Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering\n      and the struggle?\n  The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day\n      or night?\n  Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?\n  Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,\n      the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?\n  Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.\n\n  O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,\n  To meet life as a powerful conqueror,\n  No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,\n  To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving\n      my interior soul impregnable,\n  And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.\n\n  For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating--the joy of death!\n  The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,\n      for reasons,\n  Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd\n      to powder, or buried,\n  My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,\n  My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,\n      further offices, eternal uses of the earth.\n\n  O to attract by more than attraction!\n  How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none\n      of the rest,\n  It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws.\n\n  O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!\n  To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!\n  To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!\n  To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with\n      perfect nonchalance!\n  To be indeed a God!\n\n  O to sail to sea in a ship!\n  To leave this steady unendurable land,\n  To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the\n      houses,\n  To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,\n  To sail and sail and sail!\n\n  O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!\n  To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!\n  To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,\n  A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)\n  A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XII\n\n\nSong of the Broad-Axe\n\n       1\n  Weapon shapely, naked, wan,\n  Head from the mother's bowels drawn,\n  Wooded flesh and metal bone, limb only one and lip only one,\n  Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown, helve produced from a little seed sown,\n  Resting the grass amid and upon,\n  To be lean'd and to lean on.\n\n  Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades,\n      sights and sounds.\n  Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music,\n  Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ.\n\n       2\n  Welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind,\n  Welcome are lands of pine and oak,\n  Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig,\n  Welcome are lands of gold,\n  Welcome are lands of wheat and maize, welcome those of the grape,\n  Welcome are lands of sugar and rice,\n  Welcome the cotton-lands, welcome those of the white potato and\n      sweet potato,\n  Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies,\n  Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings,\n  Welcome the measureless grazing-lands, welcome the teeming soil of\n      orchards, flax, honey, hemp;\n  Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced lands,\n  Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands,\n  Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores,\n  Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc,\n  Lands of iron--lands of the make of the axe.\n\n       3\n  The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it,\n  The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear'd for garden,\n  The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lull'd,\n  The walling and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,\n  The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends,\n      and the cutting away of masts,\n  The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion'd houses and barns,\n  The remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men,\n      families, goods,\n  The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,\n  The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it, the outset\n      anywhere,\n  The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,\n  The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;\n  The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,\n  The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men with their clear untrimm'd faces,\n  The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,\n  The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless\n      impatience of restraint,\n  The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the\n      solidification;\n  The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and\n      sloops, the raftsman, the pioneer,\n  Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of\n      snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,\n  The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural\n      life of the woods, the strong day's work,\n  The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the\n      bed of hemlock-boughs and the bear-skin;\n  The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,\n  The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,\n  The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them\n      regular,\n  Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they\n      were prepared,\n  The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their\n      curv'd limbs,\n  Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by\n      posts and braces,\n  The hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,\n  The floor-men forcing the planks close to be nail'd,\n  Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,\n  The echoes resounding through the vacant building:\n  The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way,\n  The six framing-men, two in the middle and two at each end, carefully\n      bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a cross-beam,\n  The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly\n      laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet from front to rear,\n  The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the\n      trowels striking the bricks,\n  The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place,\n      and set with a knock of the trowel-handle,\n  The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the\n      steady replenishing by the hod-men;\n  Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown apprentices,\n  The swing of their axes on the square-hew'd log shaping it toward\n      the shape of a mast,\n  The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,\n  The butter-color'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,\n  The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes,\n  The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats,\n      stays against the sea;\n  The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the\n      close-pack'd square,\n  The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,\n  The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line,\n      the rise and fall of the arms forcing the water,\n  The slender, spasmic, blue-white jets, the bringing to bear of the\n      hooks and ladders and their execution,\n  The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through floors\n      if the fire smoulders under them,\n  The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense shadows;\n  The forger at his forge-furnace and the user of iron after him,\n  The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,\n  The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the\n      edge with his thumb,\n  The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket;\n  The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,\n  The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,\n  The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,\n  The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,\n  The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,\n  The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,\n  The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe\n      thither,\n  The siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty,\n  The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce\n      and parley,\n  The sack of an old city in its time,\n  The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,\n  Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,\n  Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the\n      gripe of brigands,\n  Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,\n  The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,\n  The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,\n  The power of personality just or unjust.\n\n       4\n  Muscle and pluck forever!\n  What invigorates life invigorates death,\n  And the dead advance as much as the living advance,\n  And the future is no more uncertain than the present,\n  For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the\n      delicatesse of the earth and of man,\n  And nothing endures but personal qualities.\n\n  What do you think endures?\n  Do you think a great city endures?\n  Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the\n      best built steamships?\n  Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef-d'oeuvres of engineering,\n      forts, armaments?\n\n  Away! these are not to be cherish'd for themselves,\n  They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for them,\n  The show passes, all does well enough of course,\n  All does very well till one flash of defiance.\n\n  A great city is that which has the greatest men and women,\n  If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the\n      whole world.\n\n       5\n  The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch'd\n      wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce merely,\n  Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers or the\n      anchor-lifters of the departing,\n  Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops\n      selling goods from the rest of the earth,\n  Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place where\n      money is plentiest,\n  Nor the place of the most numerous population.\n\n  Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards,\n  Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them in\n      return and understands them,\n  Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds,\n  Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,\n  Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,\n  Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,\n  Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of\n      elected persons,\n  Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of\n      death pours its sweeping and unript waves,\n  Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside\n      authority,\n  Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President,\n      Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for pay,\n  Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on\n      themselves,\n  Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,\n  Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,\n  Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men,\n  Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;\n  Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,\n  Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,\n  Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,\n  Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,\n  There the great city stands.\n\n       6\n  How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!\n  How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a\n      man's or woman's look!\n\n  All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;\n  A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the universe,\n  When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,\n  The dispute on the soul stops,\n  The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back, or laid away.\n\n  What is your money-making now? what can it do now?\n  What is your respectability now?\n  What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-books, now?\n  Where are your jibes of being now?\n  Where are your cavils about the soul now?\n\n       7\n  A sterile landscape covers the ore, there is as good as the best for\n      all the forbidding appearance,\n  There is the mine, there are the miners,\n  The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accomplish'd, the hammersmen\n      are at hand with their tongs and hammers,\n  What always served and always serves is at hand.\n\n  Than this nothing has better served, it has served all,\n  Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and long ere the Greek,\n  Served in building the buildings that last longer than any,\n  Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindustanee,\n  Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi, served those whose\n      relics remain in Central America,\n  Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars and\n      the druids,\n  Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the\n      snow-cover'd hills of Scandinavia,\n  Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls rough\n      sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, ocean waves,\n  Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the pastoral\n      tribes and nomads,\n  Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,\n  Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia,\n  Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the\n      making of those for war,\n  Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea,\n  For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages,\n  Served not the living only then as now, but served the dead.\n\n       8\n  I see the European headsman,\n  He stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked arms,\n  And leans on a ponderous axe.\n\n  (Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?\n  Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)\n\n  I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,\n  I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,\n  Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers, rejected kings,\n  Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.\n\n  I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,\n  The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out,\n  (Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out.)\n\n  I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,\n  Both blade and helve are clean,\n  They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp no more\n      the necks of queens.\n\n  I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,\n  I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any axe upon it,\n\n  I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race,\n      the newest, largest race.\n\n       9\n  (America! I do not vaunt my love for you,\n  I have what I have.)\n\n  The axe leaps!\n  The solid forest gives fluid utterances,\n  They tumble forth, they rise and form,\n  Hut, tent, landing, survey,\n  Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade,\n  Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, lamb, lath, panel, gable,\n  Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibition-house, library,\n  Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, turret, porch,\n  Hoe, rake, pitchfork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jack-plane, mallet,\n      wedge, rounce,\n  Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor,\n  Work-box, chest, string'd instrument, boat, frame, and what not,\n  Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,\n  Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans or for the poor or sick,\n  Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas.\n\n  The shapes arise!\n  Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users and all that\n      neighbors them,\n  Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kenebec,\n  Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little\n      lakes, or on the Columbia,\n  Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande, friendly\n      gatherings, the characters and fun,\n  Dwellers along the St. Lawrence, or north in Kanada, or down by the\n      Yellowstone, dwellers on coasts and off coasts,\n  Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice.\n\n  The shapes arise!\n  Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets,\n  Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads,\n  Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches,\n  Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake and canal craft, river craft,\n  Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Eastern and Western seas, and in\n      many a bay and by-place,\n  The live-oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the\n      hackmatack-roots for knees,\n  The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the\n      workmen busy outside and inside,\n  The tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze,\n      bolt, line, square, gouge, and bead-plane.\n\n       10\n  The shapes arise!\n  The shape measur'd, saw'd, jack'd, join'd, stain'd,\n  The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud,\n  The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of\n      the bride's bed,\n  The shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath,\n      the shape of the babe's cradle,\n  The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for dancers' feet,\n  The shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the friendly\n      parents and children,\n  The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and\n      woman, the roof over the well-married young man and woman,\n  The roof over the supper joyously cook'd by the chaste wife, and joyously\n      eaten by the chaste husband, content after his day's work.\n\n  The shapes arise!\n  The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, and of him or\n      her seated in the place,\n  The shape of the liquor-bar lean'd against by the young rum-drinker\n      and the old rum-drinker,\n  The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking foot- steps,\n  The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple,\n  The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish winnings and losings,\n  The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and sentenced\n      murderer, the murderer with haggard face and pinion'd arms,\n  The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipp'd\n      crowd, the dangling of the rope.\n\n  The shapes arise!\n  Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances,\n  The door passing the dissever'd friend flush'd and in haste,\n  The door that admits good news and bad news,\n  The door whence the son left home confident and puff'd up,\n  The door he enter'd again from a long and scandalous absence,\n      diseas'd, broken down, without innocence, without means.\n\n       11\n  Her shape arises,\n  She less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,\n  The gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross and soil'd,\n  She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is conceal'd from her,\n  She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor,\n  She is the best belov'd, it is without exception, she has no reason\n      to fear and she does not fear,\n  Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to\n      her as she passes,\n  She is silent, she is possess'd of herself, they do not offend her,\n  She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them, she is strong,\n  She too is a law of Nature--there is no law stronger than she is.\n\n       12\n  The main shapes arise!\n  Shapes of Democracy total, result of centuries,\n  Shapes ever projecting other shapes,\n  Shapes of turbulent manly cities,\n  Shapes of the friends and home-givers of the whole earth,\n  Shapes bracing the earth and braced with the whole earth.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIII\n\n\nSong of the Exposition\n\n       1\n  (Ah little recks the laborer,\n  How near his work is holding him to God,\n  The loving Laborer through space and time.)\n\n  After all not to create only, or found only,\n  But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded,\n  To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free,\n  To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire,\n  Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,\n  To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead,\n  These also are the lessons of our New World;\n  While how little the New after all, how much the Old, Old World!\n\n  Long and long has the grass been growing,\n  Long and long has the rain been falling,\n  Long has the globe been rolling round.\n\n       2\n  Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia,\n  Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,\n  That matter of Troy and Achilles' wrath, and AEneas', Odysseus' wanderings,\n  Placard \"Removed\" and \"To Let\" on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus,\n  Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on jaffa's gate and on\n      Mount Moriah,\n  The same on the walls of your German, French and Spanish castles,\n      and Italian collections,\n  For know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried domain\n      awaits, demands you.\n\n       3\n  Responsive to our summons,\n  Or rather to her long-nurs'd inclination,\n  Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,\n  She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown,\n  I scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance,\n  I mark her step divine, her curious eyes a-turning, rolling,\n  Upon this very scene.\n\n  The dame of dames! can I believe then,\n  Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of them retain her?\n  Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories, poems, old\n      associations, magnetize and hold on to her?\n  But that she's left them all--and here?\n\n  Yes, if you will allow me to say so,\n  I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her,\n  The same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's, heroism's\n      expression,\n  Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of her former themes,\n  Hidden and cover'd by to-day's, foundation of to-day's,\n  Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain,\n  Silent the broken-lipp'd Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those century-\n      baffling tombs,\n  Ended for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors, ended\n      the primitive call of the muses,\n  Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,\n  Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest of the\n      holy Graal,\n  Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,\n  The Crusaders' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise,\n  Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone,\n  Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish'd the turrets that Usk from its\n      waters reflected,\n  Arthur vanish'd with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and\n      Galahad, all gone, dissolv'd utterly like an exhalation;\n  Pass'd! pass'd! for us, forever pass'd, that once so mighty world,\n      now void, inanimate, phantom world,\n  Embroider'd, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous legends, myths,\n  Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords and\n      courtly dames,\n  Pass'd to its charnel vault, coffin'd with crown and armor on,\n  Blazon'd with Shakspere's purple page,\n  And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.\n\n  I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigre, (having it\n      is true in her day, although the same, changed, journey'd considerable,)\n  Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a path for\n      herself, striding through the confusion,\n  By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,\n  Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,\n  Smiling and pleas'd with palpable intent to stay,\n  She's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!\n\n       4\n  But hold--don't I forget my manners?\n  To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to chant\n      for?) to thee Columbia;\n  In liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp hands,\n  And ever henceforth sisters dear be both.\n\n  Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you,\n  I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,\n  And yet the same old human race, the same within, without,\n  Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings the same,\n  The same old love, beauty and use the same.\n\n       5\n  We do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate ourselves from thee,\n  (Would the son separate himself from the father?)\n  Looking back on thee, seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs, through\n      past ages bending, building,\n  We build to ours to-day.\n\n  Mightier than Egypt's tombs,\n  Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples,\n  Prouder than Milan's statued, spired cathedral,\n  More picturesque than Rhenish castle-keeps,\n  We plan even now to raise, beyond them all,\n  Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,\n  A keep for life for practical invention.\n\n  As in a waking vision,\n  E'en while I chant I see it rise, I scan and prophesy outside and in,\n  Its manifold ensemble.\n\n  Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,\n  Earth's modern wonder, history's seven outstripping,\n  High rising tier on tier with glass and iron facades,\n  Gladdening the sun and sky, enhued in cheerfulest hues,\n  Bronze, lilac, robin's-egg, marine and crimson,\n  Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner Freedom,\n  The banners of the States and flags of every land,\n  A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.\n\n  Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human\n      life be started,\n  Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.\n\n  Not only all the world of works, trade, products,\n  But all the workmen of the world here to be represented.\n\n  Here shall you trace in flowing operation,\n  In every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of civilization,\n  Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by magic,\n  The cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field,\n  Shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread and cloth\n      before you,\n  You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the new ones,\n  You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then\n      bread baked by the bakers,\n  You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and\n      on till they become bullion,\n  You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a\n      composing-stick is,\n  You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders,\n      shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,\n  The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before you.\n\n  In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the infinite\n      lessons of minerals,\n  In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated--in\n      another animals, animal life and development.\n\n  One stately house shall be the music house,\n  Others for other arts--learning, the sciences, shall all be here,\n  None shall be slighted, none but shall here be honor'd, help'd, exampled.\n\n       6\n  (This, this and these, America, shall be your pyramids and obelisks,\n  Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon,\n  Your temple at Olympia.)\n\n  The male and female many laboring not,\n  Shall ever here confront the laboring many,\n  With precious benefits to both, glory to all,\n  To thee America, and thee eternal Muse.\n\n  And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons!\n  In your vast state vaster than all the old,\n  Echoed through long, long centuries to come,\n  To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes,\n  Practical, peaceful life, the people's life, the People themselves,\n  Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace--elate, secure in peace.\n\n       7\n  Away with themes of war! away with war itself!\n  Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that show of\n      blacken'd, mutilated corpses!\n  That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for\n      lop-tongued wolves, not reasoning men,\n  And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,\n  With thy undaunted armies, engineering,\n  Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,\n  Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.\n\n  Away with old romance!\n  Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,\n  Away with love-verses sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues, amours of idlers,\n  Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide,\n  The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few,\n  With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.\n\n  To you ye reverent sane sisters,\n  I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,\n  To exalt the present and the real,\n  To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,\n  To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled,\n  To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,\n  To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,\n  For every man to see to it that he really do something, for every woman too;\n  To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,)\n  To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,\n  To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,\n  To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing, cooking,\n      cleaning,\n  And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.\n\n  I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here,\n  All occupations, duties broad and close,\n  Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,\n  The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,\n  The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,\n  The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,\n  Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,\n  Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet-blooded man or\n      woman, the perfect longeve personality,\n  And helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes its soul,\n  For the eternal real life to come.\n\n  With latest connections, works, the inter-transportation of the world,\n  Steam-power, the great express lines, gas, petroleum,\n  These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,\n  The Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and Gothard and\n      Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge,\n  This earth all spann'd with iron rails, with lines of steamships\n      threading in every sea,\n  Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.\n\n       8\n  And thou America,\n  Thy offspring towering e'er so high, yet higher Thee above all towering,\n  With Victory on thy left, and at thy right hand Law;\n  Thou Union holding all, fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,\n  Thee, ever thee, I sing.\n\n  Thou, also thou, a World,\n  With all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant,\n  Rounded by thee in one--one common orbic language,\n  One common indivisible destiny for All.\n\n  And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in earnest,\n  I here personify and call my themes, to make them pass before ye.\n\n  Behold, America! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!)\n  For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands;\n  Behold! thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains,\n  As in procession coming.\n\n  Behold, the sea itself,\n  And on its limitless, heaving breast, the ships;\n  See, where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the\n      green and blue,\n  See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port,\n  See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants of smoke.\n\n  Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,\n  Or in Maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful axemen,\n  Wielding all day their axes.\n\n  Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen,\n  How the ash writhes under those muscular arms!\n\n  There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,\n  Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,\n  Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous clank,\n  Like a tumult of laughter.\n\n  Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,\n  Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising,\n  See, from their chimneys how the tall flame-fires stream.\n\n  Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,\n  Thy wealthy daughter-states, Eastern and Western,\n  The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia, Texas,\n      and the rest,\n  Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, corn, rice, hemp, hops,\n  Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freight-train and the bulging store-house,\n  The grapes that ripen on thy vines, the apples in thy orchards,\n  Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes, thy coal, thy gold\n      and silver,\n  The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.\n\n  All thine O sacred Union!\n  Ships, farms, shops, barns, factories, mines,\n  City and State, North, South, item and aggregate,\n  We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!\n\n  Protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all!\n  For well we know that while thou givest each and all, (generous as God,)\n  Without thee neither all nor each, nor land, home,\n  Nor ship, nor mine, nor any here this day secure,\n  Nor aught, nor any day secure.\n\n       9\n  And thou, the Emblem waving over all!\n  Delicate beauty, a word to thee, (it may be salutary,)\n  Remember thou hast not always been as here to-day so comfortably\n      ensovereign'd,\n  In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee flag,\n  Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds of\n      stainless silk,\n  But I have seen thee bunting, to tatters torn upon thy splinter'd staff,\n  Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's breast with desperate hands,\n  Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,\n  'Mid cannons' thunder-crash and many a curse and groan and yell, and\n      rifle-volleys cracking sharp,\n  And moving masses as wild demons surging, and lives as nothing risk'd,\n  For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and sopp'd in blood,\n  For sake of that, my beauty, and that thou might'st dally as now\n      secure up there,\n  Many a good man have I seen go under.\n\n  Now here and these and hence in peace, all thine O Flag!\n  And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for them!\n  And here and hence O Union, all the work and workmen thine!\n  None separate from thee--henceforth One only, we and thou,\n  (For the blood of the children, what is it, only the blood maternal?\n  And lives and works, what are they all at last, except the roads to\n      faith and death?)\n\n  While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear Mother,\n  We own it all and several to-day indissoluble in thee;\n  Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross or lucre--\n      it is for thee, the soul in thee, electric, spiritual!\n  Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and States in thee!\n  Our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee!\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIV\n\n\nSong of the Redwood-Tree\n\n       1\n  A California song,\n  A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,\n  A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,\n  A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,\n  Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.\n\n  Farewell my brethren,\n  Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,\n  My time has ended, my term has come.\n\n  Along the northern coast,\n  Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,\n  In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,\n  With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,\n  With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,\n  Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood\n      forest dense,\n  I heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.\n\n  The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,\n  The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,\n  As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to\n      join the refrain,\n  But in my soul I plainly heard.\n\n  Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,\n  Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,\n  Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,\n  That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but\n      the future.\n\n  You untold life of me,\n  And all you venerable and innocent joys,\n  Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and many a summer sun,\n  And the white snows and night and the wild winds;\n  O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys unreck'd by man,\n  (For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,\n  And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)\n  Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,\n  Our time, our term has come.\n\n  Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,\n  We who have grandly fill'd our time,\n  With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,\n  We welcome what we wrought for through the past,\n  And leave the field for them.\n\n  For them predicted long,\n  For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,\n  For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings.'\n  In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,\n  These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,\n  To be in them absorb'd, assimilated.\n\n  Then to a loftier strain,\n  Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,\n  As if the heirs, the deities of the West,\n  Joining with master-tongue bore part.\n\n  Not wan from Asia's fetiches,\n  Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house,\n  (Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and\n      scaffolds everywhere,\n  But come from Nature's long and harmless throes, peacefully builded thence,\n  These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,\n  To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,\n  You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate.\n\n  You occult deep volitions,\n  You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself,\n      giving not taking law,\n  You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and\n      love and aught that comes from life and love,\n  You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, age\n      upon age working in death the same as life,)\n  You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould\n      the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,\n  You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd but ever alert,\n  You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be\n      unconscious of yourselves,\n  Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;\n  You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts,\n      statutes, literatures,\n  Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire,\n      lands of the Western shore,\n  We pledge, we dedicate to you.\n\n  For man of you, your characteristic race,\n  Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportionate to Nature,\n  Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or roof,\n  Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,\n  Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas heed,)\n  here fill his time,\n  To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last,\n  To disappear, to serve.\n\n  Thus on the northern coast,\n  In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and the\n      music of choppers' axes,\n  The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,\n  Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic,\n      ancient and rustling,\n  The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,\n  All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,\n  From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,\n  To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,\n  The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the\n      settlements, features all,\n  In the Mendocino woods I caught.\n\n       2\n  The flashing and golden pageant of California,\n  The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,\n  The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south,\n  Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain cliffs,\n  The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent, cyclic chemistry,\n  The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface ripening,\n      the rich ores forming beneath;\n  At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,\n  A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,\n  Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the\n      whole world,\n  To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises\n      of the Pacific,\n  Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the rivers,\n      the railroads, with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,\n  And wool and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.\n\n       3\n  But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,\n  (These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)\n  I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years,\n      till now deferr'd,\n  Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race.\n\n  The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,\n  In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial,\n  In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or even vital air.\n\n  Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,\n  I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,\n  Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America, heir of\n      the past so grand,\n  To build a grander future.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XV\n\n\nA Song for Occupations\n\n       1\n  A song for occupations!\n  In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find\n      the developments,\n  And find the eternal meanings.\n\n  Workmen and Workwomen!\n  Were all educations practical and ornamental well display'd out of\n      me, what would it amount to?\n  Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman,\n      what would it amount to?\n  Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?\n\n  The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,\n  A man like me and never the usual terms.\n\n  Neither a servant nor a master I,\n  I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will have my\n      own whoever enjoys me,\n  I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.\n\n  If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the\n      same shop,\n  If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as\n      good as your brother or dearest friend,\n  If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be\n      personally as welcome,\n  If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your sake,\n  If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think I\n      cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd deeds?\n  If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the table,\n  If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her, why\n      I often meet strangers in the street and love them.\n\n  Why what have you thought of yourself?\n  Is it you then that thought yourself less?\n  Is it you that thought the President greater than you?\n  Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?\n\n  (Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a thief,\n  Or that you are diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,\n  Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar and never\n      saw your name in print,\n  Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)\n\n       2\n  Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,\n      untouchable and untouching,\n  It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether\n      you are alive or no,\n  I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.\n\n  Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every country,\n      in-doors and out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see,\n  And all else behind or through them.\n\n  The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,\n  The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,\n  The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father.\n\n  Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,\n  Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms,\n  Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,\n  All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,\n  None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.\n\n  I bring what you much need yet always have,\n  Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,\n  I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but\n      offer the value itself.\n\n  There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,\n  It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed, it eludes discussion\n      and print,\n  It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,\n  It is for you whoever you are, it is no farther from you than your\n      hearing and sight are from you,\n  It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever provoked by them.\n\n  You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,\n  You may read the President's message and read nothing about it there,\n  Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury\n      department, or in the daily papers or weekly papers,\n  Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts\n      of stock.\n\n       3\n  The sun and stars that float in the open air,\n  The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of them is\n      something grand,\n  I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that it is happiness,\n  And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or\n      bon-mot or reconnoissance,\n  And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us,\n      and without luck must be a failure for us,\n  And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency.\n\n  The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the\n      greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things,\n  The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,\n  The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders\n      that fill each minute of time forever,\n  What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?\n  Have you reckon'd them for your trade or farm-work? or for the\n      profits of your store?\n  Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure,\n      or a lady's leisure?\n\n  Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form that it\n      might be painted in a picture?\n  Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?\n  Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious combinations\n      and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the savans?\n  Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?\n  Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?\n  Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or\n      agriculture itself?\n\n  Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and\n      the practice handed along in manufactures, will we rate them so high?\n  Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,\n  I rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and\n      man I rate beyond all rate.\n\n  We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,\n  I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,\n  I am this day just as much in love with them as you,\n  Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon the earth.\n\n  We consider bibles and religions divine--I do not say they are not divine,\n  I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still,\n  It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,\n  Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,\n      than they are shed out of you.\n\n       4\n  The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,\n  The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who\n      are here for him,\n  The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,\n  The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you,\n  Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the\n      going and coming of commerce and malls, are all for you.\n\n  List close my scholars dear,\n  Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,\n  Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you,\n  The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records\n      reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same,\n  If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?\n  The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays would\n      be vacuums.\n\n  All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,\n  (Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of\n      the arches and cornices?)\n\n  All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments,\n  It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor the\n      beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his\n      sweet romanza, nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of the\n      women's chorus,\n  It is nearer and farther than they.\n\n       5\n  Will the whole come back then?\n  Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is\n      there nothing greater or more?\n  Does all sit there with you, with the mystic unseen soul?\n\n  Strange and hard that paradox true I give,\n  Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.\n\n  House-building, measuring, sawing the boards,\n  Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin-roofing,\n      shingle-dressing,\n  Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, flagging of sidewalks by flaggers,\n  The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-kiln and brickkiln,\n  Coal-mines and all that is down there, the lamps in the darkness,\n      echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast native thoughts\n      looking through smutch'd faces,\n  Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains or by river-banks, men\n      around feeling the melt with huge crowbars, lumps of ore, the\n      due combining of ore, limestone, coal,\n  The blast-furnace and the puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the\n      bottom of the melt at last, the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars\n      of pig-iron, the strong clean-shaped Trail for railroads,\n  Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house,\n      steam-saws, the

XVI\n\n\nA Song of the Rolling Earth\n\n       1\n  A song of the rolling earth, and of words according,\n  Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?\n      those curves, angles, dots?\n  No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the ground\n      and sea,\n  They are in the air, they are in you.\n\n  Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds\n      out of your friends' mouths?\n  No, the real words are more delicious than they.\n\n  Human bodies are words, myriads of words,\n  (In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's,\n      well-shaped, natural, gay,\n  Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.)\n\n  Air, soil, water, fire--those are words,\n  I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with\n      theirs--my name is nothing to them,\n  Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would\n      air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?\n\n  A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words,\n      sayings, meanings,\n  The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,\n      are sayings and meanings also.\n\n  The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth,\n  The masters know the earth's words and use them more than audible words.\n\n  Amelioration is one of the earth's words,\n  The earth neither lags nor hastens,\n  It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump,\n  It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as\n      much as perfections show.\n\n  The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,\n  The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal'd either,\n  They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,\n  They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,\n  Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,\n  I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?\n  To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?\n\n  (Accouche! accouchez!\n  Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?\n  Will you squat and stifle there?)\n\n  The earth does not argue,\n  Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,\n  Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,\n  Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,\n  Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,\n  Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.\n\n  The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself,\n      possesses still underneath,\n  Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the\n      wail of slaves,\n  Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young\n      people, accents of bargainers,\n  Underneath these possessing words that never fall.\n\n  To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail,\n  The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection\n      does not fall,\n  Also the day and night do not fall, and the voyage we pursue does not fall.\n\n  Of the interminable sisters,\n  Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,\n  Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,\n  The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.\n\n  With her ample back towards every beholder,\n  With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,\n  Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,\n  Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her\n      eyes glance back from it,\n  Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,\n  Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.\n\n  Seen at hand or seen at a distance,\n  Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,\n  Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion,\n  Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances\n      of those who are with them,\n  From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance,\n  From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things,\n  From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,\n  From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,\n  Every day in public appearing without fall, but never twice with the\n      same companions.\n\n  Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and\n      sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;\n  Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and\n      sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.\n\n  Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,\n  Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,\n  The soul's realization and determination still inheriting,\n  The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,\n  No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,\n  Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,\n  Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea.\n\n       2\n  Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you,\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.\n\n  Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid,\n  You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,\n  For none more than you are the present and the past,\n  For none more than you is immortality.\n\n  Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word of the\n      past and present, and the true word of immortality;\n  No one can acquire for another--not one,\n  Not one can grow for another--not one.\n\n  The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,\n  The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,\n  The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,\n  The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,\n  The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,\n  The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him--it cannot fail,\n  The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress\n      not to the audience,\n  And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or\n      the indication of his own.\n\n       3\n  I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall\n      be complete,\n  The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains\n      jagged and broken.\n\n  I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those\n      of the earth,\n  There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the\n      theory of the earth,\n  No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,\n      unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth,\n  Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude of\n      the earth.\n\n  I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which\n      responds love,\n  It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never refuses.\n\n  I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,\n  All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth,\n  Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth,\n  Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch.\n\n  I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,\n  It is always to leave the best untold.\n\n  When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,\n  My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,\n  My breath will not be obedient to its organs,\n  I become a dumb man.\n\n  The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best,\n  It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,\n  Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before,\n  The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,\n  Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before,\n  But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,\n  No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,\n  Undeniable growth has establish'd it.\n\n       4\n  These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,\n  (If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?\n  If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)\n\n  I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells\n      the best,\n  I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.\n\n  Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!\n  Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!\n  Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,\n  It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,\n  When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear.\n\n  I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall,\n  I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,\n  The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses\n      all and is faithful to all,\n  He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that you\n      are not an iota less than they,\n  You shall be fully glorified in them.\n\n\n\n\nYouth, Day, Old Age and Night\n\n  Youth, large, lusty, loving--youth full of grace, force, fascination,\n  Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace,\n      force, fascination?\n\n  Day full-blown and splendid-day of the immense sun, action,\n      ambition, laughter,\n  The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep and\n      restoring darkness.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVII.  BIRDS OF PASSAGE\n\n\nSong of the Universal\n\n       1\n  Come said the Muse,\n  Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,\n  Sing me the universal.\n\n  In this broad earth of ours,\n  Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,\n  Enclosed and safe within its central heart,\n  Nestles the seed perfection.\n\n  By every life a share or more or less,\n  None born but it is born, conceal'd or unconceal'd the seed is waiting.\n\n       2\n  Lo! keen-eyed towering science,\n  As from tall peaks the modern overlooking,\n  Successive absolute fiats issuing.\n\n  Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science,\n  For it has history gather'd like husks around the globe,\n  For it the entire star-myriads roll through the sky.\n\n  In spiral routes by long detours,\n  (As a much-tacking ship upon the sea,)\n  For it the partial to the permanent flowing,\n  For it the real to the ideal tends.\n\n  For it the mystic evolution,\n  Not the right only justified, what we call evil also justified.\n\n  Forth from their masks, no matter what,\n  From the huge festering trunk, from craft and guile and tears,\n  Health to emerge and joy, joy universal.\n\n  Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,\n  Out of the bad majority, the varied countless frauds of men and states,\n  Electric, antiseptic yet, cleaving, suffusing all,\n  Only the good is universal.\n\n       3\n  Over the mountain-growths disease and sorrow,\n  An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,\n  High in the purer, happier air.\n\n  From imperfection's murkiest cloud,\n  Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,\n  One flash of heaven's glory.\n\n  To fashion's, custom's discord,\n  To the mad Babel-din, the deafening orgies,\n  Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,\n  From some far shore the final chorus sounding.\n\n  O the blest eyes, the happy hearts,\n  That see, that know the guiding thread so fine,\n  Along the mighty labyrinth.\n\n       4\n  And thou America,\n  For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality,\n  For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.\n\n  Thou too surroundest all,\n  Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by pathways broad and new,\n  To the ideal tendest.\n\n  The measure'd faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,\n  Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,\n  Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,\n  All eligible to all.\n\n  All, all for immortality,\n  Love like the light silently wrapping all,\n  Nature's amelioration blessing all,\n  The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,\n  Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.\n\n  Give me O God to sing that thought,\n  Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,\n  In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,\n  Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,\n  Health, peace, salvation universal.\n\n  Is it a dream?\n  Nay but the lack of it the dream,\n  And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,\n  And all the world a dream.\n\n\n\n\nPioneers! O Pioneers!\n\n       Come my tan-faced children,\n  Follow well in order, get your weapons ready,\n  Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged axes?\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       For we cannot tarry here,\n  We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of danger,\n  We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       O you youths, Western youths,\n  So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and friendship,\n  Plain I see you Western youths, see you tramping with the foremost,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Have the elder races halted?\n  Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?\n  We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       All the past we leave behind,\n  We debouch upon a newer mightier world, varied world,\n  Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       We detachments steady throwing,\n  Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,\n  Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,\n       Pioneers!

O pioneers!\n\n       From Nebraska, from Arkansas,\n  Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the continental\n       blood intervein'd,\n  All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the Northern,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       O resistless restless race!\n  O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender love for all!\n  O I mourn and yet exult, I am rapt with love for all,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Raise the mighty mother mistress,\n  Waving high the delicate mistress, over all the starry mistress,\n       (bend your heads all,)\n  Raise the fang'd and warlike mistress, stern, impassive, weapon'd mistress,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       See my children, resolute children,\n  By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield or falter,\n  Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       On and on the compact ranks,\n  With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead quickly fill'd,\n  Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never stopping,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       O to die advancing on!\n  Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?\n  Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is fill'd.\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       All the pulses of the world,\n  Falling in they beat for us, with the Western movement beat,\n  Holding single or together, steady moving to the front, all for us,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Life's involv'd and varied pageants,\n  All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their work,\n  All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n      All the hapless silent lovers,\n  All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,\n  All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n      I too with my soul and body,\n  We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,\n  Through these shores amid the shadows, with the apparitions pressing,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n      Lo, the darting bowling orb!\n  Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering suns and planets,\n  All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n      These are of us, they are with us,\n  All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo wait behind,\n  We to-day's procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n  O you daughters of the West!\n  O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!\n  Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Minstrels latent on the prairies!\n  (Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, you have done your work,)\n  Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Not for delectations sweet,\n  Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the studious,\n  Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Do the feasters gluttonous feast?\n  Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and bolted doors?\n  Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,\n       Pioneers! O pioneers!\n\n       Has the night descended?\n  Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged nodding\n       on our way?\n  Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,\n       Pioneers!

(it lurks in the night here somewhere,)\n  O if I am to have so much, let me have more!\n\n  A word then, (for I will conquer it,)\n  The word final, superior to all,\n  Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;\n  Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?\n  Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?\n\n  Whereto answering, the sea,\n  Delaying not, hurrying not,\n  Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,\n  Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,\n  And again death, death, death, death\n  Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,\n  But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,\n  Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,\n  Death, death, death, death, death.\n\n  Which I do not forget.\n  But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,\n  That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray beach,\n  With the thousand responsive songs at random,\n  My own songs awaked from that hour,\n  And with them the key, the word up from the waves,\n  The word of the sweetest song and all songs,\n  That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,\n  (Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet\n      garments, bending aside,)\n  The sea whisper'd me.\n\n\n\n\nAs I Ebb'd with the Ocean of Life\n\n       1\n  As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,\n  As I wended the shores I know,\n  As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,\n  Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,\n  Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,\n  I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,\n  Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,\n  Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,\n  The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land\n      of the globe.\n\n  Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those\n      slender windrows,\n  Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,\n  Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide,\n  Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,\n  Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,\n  These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,\n  As I wended the shores I know,\n  As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.\n\n       2\n  As I wend to the shores I know not,\n  As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,\n  As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,\n  As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,\n  I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,\n  A few sands and dead leaves to gather,\n  Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.\n\n  O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,\n  Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,\n  Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have\n      not once had the least idea who or what I am,\n  But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet\n      untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,\n  Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,\n  With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,\n  Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.\n\n  I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single\n      object, and that no man ever can,\n  Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon\n      me and sting me,\n  Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.\n\n       3\n  You oceans both, I close with you,\n  We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why,\n  These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.\n\n  You friable shore with trails of debris,\n  You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,\n  What is yours is mine my father.\n\n  I too Paumanok,\n  I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been\n      wash'd on your shores,\n  I too am but a trail of drift and debris,\n  I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island.\n\n  I throw myself upon your breast my father,\n  I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,\n  I hold you so firm till you answer me something.\n\n  Kiss me my father,\n  Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,\n  Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy.\n\n       4\n  Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)\n  Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,\n  Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,\n  Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or\n      gather from you.\n\n  I mean tenderly by you and all,\n  I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead,\n      and following me and mine.\n\n  Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,\n  Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,\n  (See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,\n  See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)\n  Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,\n  Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,\n  From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,\n  Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,\n  Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,\n  A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,\n      drifted at random,\n  Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,\n  Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets,\n  We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you,\n  You up there walking or sitting,\n  Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.\n\n\n\n\nTears\n\n  Tears! tears! tears!\n  In the night, in solitude, tears,\n  On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand,\n  Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,\n  Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;\n  O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?\n  What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?\n  Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;\n  O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the beach!\n  O wild and dismal night storm, with wind--O belching and desperate!\n  O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and\n      regulated pace,\n  But away at night as you fly, none looking--O then the unloosen'd ocean,\n  Of tears! tears! tears!\n\n\n\n\nTo the Man-of-War-Bird\n\n  Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,\n  Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions,\n  (Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,\n  And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee,)\n  Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating,\n  As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,\n  (Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating vast.)\n\n  Far, far at sea,\n  After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks,\n  With re-appearing day as now so happy and serene,\n  The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,\n  The limpid spread of air cerulean,\n  Thou also re-appearest.\n\n  Thou born to match the gale, (thou art all wings,)\n  To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,\n  Thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,\n  Days, even weeks untired and onward, through spaces, realms gyrating,\n  At dusk that lookist on Senegal, at morn America,\n  That sport'st amid the lightning-flash and thunder-cloud,\n  In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,\n  What joys! what joys were thine!\n\n\n\n\nAboard at a Ship's Helm\n\n  Aboard at a ship's helm,\n  A young steersman steering with care.\n\n  Through fog on a sea-coast dolefully ringing,\n  An ocean-bell--O a warning bell, rock'd by the waves.\n\n  O you give good notice indeed, you bell by the sea-reefs ringing,\n  Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreck-place.\n\n  For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the loud admonition,\n  The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her gray sails,\n  The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds\n      away gayly and safe.\n\n  But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard the ship!\n  Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, voyaging, voyaging.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Beach at Night\n\n  On the beach at night,\n  Stands a child with her father,\n  Watching the east, the autumn sky.\n\n  Up through the darkness,\n  While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,\n  Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky,\n  Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,\n  Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter,\n  And nigh at hand, only a very little above,\n  Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades.\n\n  From the beach the child holding the hand of her father,\n  Those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all,\n  Watching, silently weeps.\n\n  Weep not, child,\n  Weep not, my darling,\n  With these kisses let me remove your tears,\n  The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,\n  They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in\n      apparition,\n  Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the\n      Pleiades shall emerge,\n  They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall\n      shine out again,\n  The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure,\n  The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall\n      again shine.\n\n  Then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter?\n  Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?\n\n  Something there is,\n  (With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper,\n  I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)\n  Something there is more immortal even than the stars,\n  (Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)\n  Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter\n  Longer than sun or any revolving satellite,\n  Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.\n\n\n\n\nThe World below the Brine\n\n  The world below the brine,\n  Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves,\n  Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick\n      tangle openings, and pink turf,\n  Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the\n      play of light through the water,\n  Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes,\n      and the aliment of the swimmers,\n  Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling\n      close to the bottom,\n  The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting\n      with his flukes,\n  The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy\n      sea-leopard, and the sting-ray,\n  Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths,\n      breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do,\n  The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed\n      by beings like us who walk this sphere,\n  The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Beach at Night Alone\n\n  On the beach at night alone,\n  As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,\n  As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef\n      of the universes and of the future.\n\n  A vast similitude interlocks all,\n  All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,\n  All distances of place however wide,\n  All distances of time, all inanimate forms,\n  All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in\n      different worlds,\n  All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,\n  All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,\n  All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,\n  All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,\n  This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd,\n  And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.\n\n\n\n\nSong for All Seas, All Ships\n\n       1\n  To-day a rude brief recitative,\n  Of ships sailing the seas, each with its special flag or ship-signal,\n  Of unnamed heroes in the ships--of waves spreading and spreading\n      far as the eye can reach,\n  Of dashing spray, and the winds piping and blowing,\n  And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations,\n  Fitful, like a surge.\n\n  Of sea-captains young or old, and the mates, and of all intrepid sailors,\n  Of the few, very choice, taciturn, whom fate can never surprise nor\n      death dismay.\n  Pick'd sparingly without noise by thee old ocean, chosen by thee,\n  Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time, and unitest nations,\n  Suckled by thee, old husky nurse, embodying thee,\n  Indomitable, untamed as thee.\n\n  (Ever the heroes on water or on land, by ones or twos appearing,\n  Ever the stock preserv'd and never lost, though rare, enough for\n      seed preserv'd.)\n\n       2\n  Flaunt out O sea your separate flags of nations!\n  Flaunt out visible as ever the various ship-signals!\n  But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man\n      one flag above all the rest,\n  A spiritual woven signal for all nations, emblem of man elate above death,\n  Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates,\n  And all that went down doing their duty,\n  Reminiscent of them, twined from all intrepid captains young or old,\n  A pennant universal, subtly waving all time, o'er all brave sailors,\n  All seas, all ships.\n\n\n\n\nPatroling Barnegat\n\n  Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,\n  Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering,\n  Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,\n  Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,\n  Out in the shadows there milk-white combs careering,\n  On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting,\n  Where through the murk the easterly death-wind breasting,\n  Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing,\n  (That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)\n  Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending,\n  Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,\n  Along the midnight edge by those milk-white combs careering,\n  A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,\n  That savage trinity warily watching.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Sea-Ship\n\n  After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds,\n  After the white-gray sails taut to their spars and ropes,\n  Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, lifting up their necks,\n  Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship,\n  Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,\n  Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves,\n  Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,\n  Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface,\n  Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing,\n  The wake of the sea-ship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome\n      under the sun,\n  A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments,\n  Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XX.  BY THE ROADSIDE\n\n\nA Boston Ballad [1854]\n\n  To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,\n  Here's a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.\n\n  Clear the way there Jonathan!\n  Way for the President's marshal--way for the government cannon!\n  Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions\n      copiously tumbling.)\n\n  I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play\n      Yankee Doodle.\n  How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!\n  Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.\n\n  A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,\n  Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.\n\n  Why this is indeed a show--it has called the dead out of the earth!\n  The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!\n  Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!\n  Cock'd hats of mothy mould--crutches made of mist!\n  Arms in slings--old men leaning on young men's shoulders.\n\n  What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of\n      bare gums?\n  Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for\n      firelocks and level them?\n\n  If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President's marshal,\n  If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.\n\n  For shame old maniacs--bring down those toss'd arms, and let your\n      white hair be,\n  Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows,\n  See how well dress'd, see how orderly they conduct themselves.\n\n  Worse and worse--can't you stand it? are you retreating?\n  Is this hour with the living too dead for you?\n\n  Retreat then--pell-mell!\n  To your graves--back--back to the hills old limpers!\n  I do not think you belong here anyhow.\n\n  But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it\n      is, gentlemen of Boston?\n\n  I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,\n  They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the\n      royal vault,\n  Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the\n      graveclothes, box up his bones for a journey,\n  Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper,\n  Up with your anchor--shake out your sails--steer straight toward\n      Boston bay.\n\n  Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government cannon,\n  Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession,\n      guard it with foot and dragoons.\n\n  This centre-piece for them;\n  Look, all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!\n\n  The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that\n      will not stay,\n  Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.\n  You have got your revenge, old buster--the crown is come to its own,\n      and more than its own.\n\n  Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from\n      this day,\n  You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.\n\n\n\n\nEurope [The 72d and 73d Years of These States]\n\n  Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,\n  Like lightning it le'pt forth half startled at itself,\n  Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats\n      of kings.\n\n  O hope and faith!\n  O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!\n  O many a sicken'd heart!\n  Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.\n\n  And you, paid to defile the People--you liars, mark!\n  Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,\n  For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his\n      simplicity the poor man's wages,\n  For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh'd at in\n      the breaking,\n\n  Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge,\n      or the heads of the nobles fall;\n  The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.\n\n  But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the\n      frighten'd monarchs come back,\n  Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,\n  Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.\n\n  Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,\n  Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in\n      scarlet folds,\n  Whose face and eyes none may see,\n  Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,\n  One finger crook'd pointed high over the top, like the head of a\n      snake appears.\n\n  Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men,\n  The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are\n      flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,\n  And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.\n\n  Those corpses of young men,\n  Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc'd by\n      the gray lead,\n  Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter'd vitality.\n\n  They live in other young men O kings!\n  They live in brothers again ready to defy you,\n  They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.\n\n  Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom but grows seed for freedom,\n      in its turn to bear seed,\n  Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.\n\n  Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,\n  But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning.\n  Liberty, let others despair of you--I never despair of you.\n\n  Is the house shut? is the master away?\n  Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,\n  He will soon return, his messengers come anon.\n\n\n\n\nA Hand-Mirror\n\n  Hold it up sternly--see this it sends back, (who is it? is it you?)\n  Outside fair costume, within ashes and filth,\n  No more a flashing eye, no more a sonorous voice or springy step,\n  Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,\n  A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,\n  Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,\n  Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,\n  Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,\n  Words babble, hearing and touch callous,\n  No brain, no heart left, no magnetism of sex;\n  Such from one look in this looking-glass ere you go hence,\n  Such a result so soon--and from such a beginning!\n\n\n\n\nGods\n\n  Lover divine and perfect Comrade,\n  Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,\n  Be thou my God.\n\n  Thou, thou, the Ideal Man,\n  Fair, able, beautiful, content, and loving,\n  Complete in body and dilate in spirit,\n  Be thou my God.\n\n  O Death, (for Life has served its turn,)\n  Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion,\n  Be thou my God.\n\n  Aught, aught of mightiest, best I see, conceive, or know,\n  (To break the stagnant tie--thee, thee to free, O soul,)\n  Be thou my God.\n\n  All great ideas, the races' aspirations,\n  All heroisms, deeds of rapt enthusiasts,\n  Be ye my Gods.\n\n  Or Time and Space,\n  Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous,\n  Or some fair shape I viewing, worship,\n  Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night,\n  Be ye my Gods.\n\n\n\n\nGerms\n\n  Forms, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,\n  The ones known, and the ones unknown, the ones on the stars,\n  The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,\n  Wonders as of those countries, the soil, trees, cities, inhabitants,\n      whatever they may be,\n  Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combinations and effects,\n  Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or anywhere, stand\n      provided for a handful of space, which I extend my arm and\n      half enclose with my hand,\n  That containing the start of each and all, the virtue, the germs of all.\n\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n  Of ownership--as if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter\n      upon all, and incorporate them into himself or herself;\n  Of vista--suppose some sight in arriere through the formative chaos,\n      presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain'd on the journey,\n  (But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)\n  Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become\n      supplied--and of what will yet be supplied,\n  Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in\n      what will yet be supplied.\n\n\n\nWhen I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer\n\n  When I heard the learn'd astronomer,\n  When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\n  When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\n  When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much\n      applause in the lecture-room,\n  How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\n  Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,\n  In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\n  Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.\n\n\n\n\nPerfections\n\n  Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves,\n  As souls only understand souls.\n\n\n\n\nO Me! O Life!\n\n  O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,\n  Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish,\n  Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I,\n      and who more faithless?)\n  Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the\n      struggle ever renew'd,\n  Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see\n      around me,\n  Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,\n  The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?\n\n       Answer.\n  That you are here--that life exists and identity,\n  That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.\n\n\n\n\nTo a President\n\n  All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages,\n  You have not learn'd of Nature--of the politics of Nature you have\n      not learn'd the great amplitude, rectitude, impartiality,\n  You have not seen that only such as they are for these States,\n  And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from\n      these States.\n\n\n\n\nI Sit and Look Out\n\n  I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all\n      oppression and shame,\n  I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with\n      themselves, remorseful after deeds done,\n  I see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,\n      neglected, gaunt, desperate,\n  I see the wife misused by her husband, I see the treacherous seducer\n      of young women,\n  I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to be\n      hid, I see these sights on the earth,\n  I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny, I see martyrs and\n      prisoners,\n  I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots who\n      shall be kill'd to preserve the lives of the rest,\n  I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon\n      laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;\n  All these--all the meanness and agony without end I sitting look out upon,\n  See, hear, and am silent.\n\n\n\n\nTo Rich Givers\n\n  What you give me I cheerfully accept,\n  A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money, as I\n      rendezvous with my poems,\n  A traveler's lodging and breakfast as journey through the States,--\n      why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? why to advertise for them?\n  For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman,\n  For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of\n      the universe.\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalliance of the Eagles\n\n  Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)\n  Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,\n  The rushing amorous contact high in space together,\n  The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,\n  Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,\n  In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,\n  Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,\n  A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,\n  Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse flight,\n  She hers, he his, pursuing.\n\n\n\n\nRoaming in Thought [After reading Hegel]\n\n  Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the little that is Good\n      steadily hastening towards immortality,\n  And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening to merge itself\n      and become lost and dead.\n\n\n\n\nA Farm Picture\n\n  Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,\n  A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding,\n  And haze and vista, and the far horizon fading away.\n\n\n\n\nA Child's Amaze\n\n  Silent and amazed even when a little boy,\n  I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,\n  As contending against some being or influence.\n\n\n\n\nThe Runner\n\n  On a flat road runs the well-train'd runner,\n  He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs,\n  He is thinly clothed, he leans forward as he runs,\n  With lightly closed fists and arms partially rais'd.\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Women\n\n  Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some young,\n  The young are beautiful--but the old are more beautiful than the young.\n\n\n\n\nMother and Babe\n\n  I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother,\n  The sleeping mother and babe--hush'd, I study them long and long.\n\n\n\n\nThought\n\n  Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;\n  As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly\n      affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who\n      do not believe in men.\n\n\n\n\nVisor'd\n\n  A mask, a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,\n  Concealing her face, concealing her form,\n  Changes and transformations every hour, every moment,\n  Falling upon her even when she sleeps.\n\n\n\n\nThought\n\n  Of justice--as If could be any thing but the same ample law,\n      expounded by natural judges and saviors,\n  As if it might be this thing or that thing, according to decisions.\n\n\n\n\nGliding O'er all\n\n  Gliding o'er all, through all,\n  Through Nature, Time, and Space,\n  As a ship on the waters advancing,\n  The voyage of the soul--not life alone,\n  Death, many deaths I'll sing.\n\n\n\n\nHast Never Come to Thee an Hour\n\n  Hast never come to thee an hour,\n  A sudden gleam divine, precipitating, bursting all these bubbles,\n      fashions, wealth?\n  These eager business aims--books, politics, art, amours,\n  To utter nothingness?\n\n\n\n\nThought\n\n  Of Equality--as if it harm'd me, giving others the same chances and\n      rights as myself--as if it were not indispensable to my own\n      rights that others possess the same.\n\n\n\n\nTo Old Age\n\n  I see in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as\n      it pours in the great sea.\n\n\n\n\nLocations and Times\n\n  Locations and times--what is it in me that meets them all, whenever\n      and wherever, and makes me at home?\n  Forms, colors, densities, odors--what is it in me that corresponds\n      with them?\n\n\n\n\nOfferings\n\n  A thousand perfect men and women appear,\n  Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and\n      youths, with offerings.\n\n\n\n\nTo The States [To Identify the 16th, 17th, or 18th Presidentiad]\n\n  Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?\n  What deepening twilight-scum floating atop of the waters,\n  Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol?\n  What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North,\n      your arctic freezings!)\n  Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that\n      the President?\n  Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for\n      reasons;\n  (With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we\n      all duly awake,\n  South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS\n\n\nFirst O Songs for a Prelude\n\n  First O songs for a prelude,\n  Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,\n  How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,\n  How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,\n  (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!\n  O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)\n  How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with\n      indifferent hand,\n  How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard\n      in their stead,\n  How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of\n      soldiers,)\n  How Manhattan drum-taps led.\n\n  Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,\n  Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and\n      turbulent city,\n  Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,\n  With her million children around her, suddenly,\n  At dead of night, at news from the south,\n  Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.\n\n  A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,\n  Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.\n\n  From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,\n  Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.\n\n  To the drum-taps prompt,\n  The young men falling in and arming,\n  The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's\n      hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)\n  The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,\n  The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing\n      the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,\n  The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;\n  Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,\n  The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their\n      accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,\n  Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,\n  The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the\n      sunrise cannon and again at sunset,\n  Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark\n      from the wharves,\n  (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with\n      their guns on their shoulders!\n  How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and\n      their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)\n  The blood of the city up-arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,\n  The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the\n      public buildings and stores,\n  The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother,\n  (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,)\n  The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way,\n  The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites,\n  The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,\n      rumble lightly over the stones,\n  (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,\n  Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)\n  All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,\n  The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,\n  The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no\n      mere parade now;\n  War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away!\n  War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to\n      welcome it.\n\n  Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!\n  It's O for a manly life in the camp.\n\n  And the sturdy artillery,\n  The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,\n  Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for\n      courtesies merely,\n  Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)\n\n  And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,\n  Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,\n  Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid\n      all your children,\n  But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.\n\n\n\n\nEighteen Sixty-One\n\n  Arm'd year--year of the struggle,\n  No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,\n  Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano,\n  But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,\n      carrying rifle on your shoulder,\n  With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in\n      the belt at your side,\n  As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the\n      continent,\n  Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,\n  Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the\n      dwellers in Manhattan,\n  Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,\n  Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies,\n  Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along\n      the Ohio river,\n  Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at\n      Chattanooga on the mountain top,\n  Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing\n      weapons, robust year,\n  Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,\n  Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd cannon,\n  I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.\n\n\n\n\nBeat! Beat!

aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped\n      like a sword,\n  Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards\n      have rais'd it,\n  Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,\n  Discarding peace over all the sea and land.\n\n       Banner and Pennant:\n  Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!\n  No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,\n  We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,\n  Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor\n      any five, nor ten,)\n  Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,\n  But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines\n      below, are ours,\n  And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,\n  And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,\n  Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we over all,\n  Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square\n      miles, the capitals,\n  The forty millions of people,--O bard! in life and death supreme,\n  We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,\n  Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,\n  This song to the soul of one poor little child.\n\n       Child:\n  O my father I like not the houses,\n  They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,\n  But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I like,\n  That pennant I would be and must be.\n\n       Father:\n  Child of mine you fill me with anguish,\n  To be that pennant would be too fearful,\n  Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,\n  It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,\n  Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you\n      to do with them?\n  With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?\n\n       Banner:\n  Demons and death then I sing,\n  Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,\n  And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,\n  Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea,\n  And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,\n  And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines,\n  And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the\n      hot sun shining south,\n  And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore,\n      and my Western shore the same,\n  And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with\n      bends and chutes,\n  And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of Missouri,\n  The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,\n  Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield of all,\n  Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,\n  No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,\n  But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,\n  Croaking like crows here in the wind.\n\n       Poet:\n  My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,\n  Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and resolute,\n  I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,\n  My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)\n  I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,\n  Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!\n  Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their\n      prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those\n      houses to destroy them,\n  You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast,\n      full of comfort, built with money,\n  May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all\n      stand fast;)\n  O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor\n      the material good nutriment,\n  Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,\n  Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and\n      carrying cargoes,\n  Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth\n      I see you,\n  Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars,\n      (ever-enlarging stars,)\n  Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,\n      measuring the sky,\n  (Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,\n  While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching\n      thrift, thrift;)\n  O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing\n      so curious,\n  Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody\n      death, loved by me,\n  So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night!\n  Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute\n      owner of all)--O banner and pennant!\n  I too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines\n      are nothing--I see them not,\n  I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes,\n      sing you only,\n  Flapping up there in the wind.\n\n\n\n\nRise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps\n\n       1\n  Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer sweep,\n  Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave me,\n  Long I roam'd amid the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,\n  I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd\n      the Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus,\n  I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,\n  I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,\n  I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,\n\n  I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over,\n  I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,\n  Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my\n      heart, and powerful!)\n  Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,\n  Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and\n      fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;\n  These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive\n      and masterful,\n  All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,\n  Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.\n\n       2\n  'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,\n  Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,\n  Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,\n  Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,\n  Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,\n  Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed\n      inexhaustible?)\n  What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of\n      the mountains and sea?\n  What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?\n  Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?\n  Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,\n  Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,\n      unchain'd;\n  What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,\n  How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!\n  How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the\n      flashes of lightning!\n  How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown\n      through the dark by those flashes of lightning!\n  (Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,\n  In a lull of the deafening confusion.)\n\n       3\n  Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!\n  And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!\n  Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,\n  My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment,\n  Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only\n      half satisfied,\n  One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground before me,\n  Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing low;\n  The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the\n      certainties suitable to me,\n  Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's\n      dauntlessness,\n  I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,\n  I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air\n      waited long;\n  But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,\n  I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities electric,\n  I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,\n  Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,\n  No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.\n\n\n\n\nVirginia--The West\n\n  The noble sire fallen on evil days,\n  I saw with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,\n  (Memories of old in abeyance, love and faith in abeyance,)\n  The insane knife toward the Mother of All.\n\n  The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,\n  I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio's waters and of Indiana,\n  To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,\n  Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.\n\n  Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,\n  As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against\n      me, and why seek my life?\n  When you yourself forever provide to defend me?\n  For you provided me Washington--and now these also.\n\n\n\n\nCity of Ships\n\n  City of ships!\n  (O the black ships! O the fierce ships!\n  O the beautiful sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)\n  City of the world!

whirling in and\n      out with eddies and foam!\n  City of wharves and stores--city of tall facades of marble and iron!\n  Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!\n  Spring up O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!\n  Fear not--submit to no models but your own O city!\n  Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!\n  I have rejected nothing you

chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,\n  War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!\n\n\n\n\nThe Centenarian's Story\n\n       [Volunteer of 1861-2, at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting\n       the Centenarian.]\n  Give me your hand old Revolutionary,\n  The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)\n  Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and\n      extra years,\n  You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,\n  Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.\n\n  Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,\n  On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,\n  There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,\n  Do you hear the officers giving their orders?\n  Do you hear the clank of the muskets?\n  Why what comes over you now old man?\n  Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?\n  The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,\n  Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,\n  While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,\n  Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\n  O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.\n\n  But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,\n  Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\n\n  As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,\n  Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,\n  You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\n\n       [The Centenarian]\n  When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,\n  But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,\n  And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,\n  And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and south-\n      east and south-west,\n  Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,\n  And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and\n      suddenly raged,\n  As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of friends,\n  But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I\n      took part in it,\n  Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.\n\n  Aye, this is the ground,\n  My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,\n  The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,\n  Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,\n  I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,\n  I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\n  Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.\n\n  As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\n  It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\n  By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up\n      his unsheath'd sword,\n  It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.\n\n  Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,\n  We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\n  And the transports swarming with soldiers.\n\n  A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\n\n  Twenty thousand were brought against us,\n  A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.\n\n  I tell not now the whole of the battle,\n  But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the\n      red-coats,\n  Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,\n  And how long and well it stood confronting death.\n\n  Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\n  It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\n  Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally\n      to the General.\n\n  Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,\n  Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,\n  The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\n      their guns,\n  That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.\n\n  The General watch'd them from this hill,\n  They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\n  Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\n  But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\n\n  It sickens me yet, that slaughter!\n  I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\n  I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\n\n  Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,\n  But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.\n\n  We fought the fight in detachments,\n  Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\n      against us,\n  Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back\n      to the works on this hill,\n  Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.\n\n  That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand\n      strong,\n  Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\n\n  That and here my General's first battle,\n  No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude\n      with applause,\n  Nobody clapp'd hands here then.\n\n  But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\n  Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,\n  While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us encamp'd,\n  Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\n      their victory.\n\n  So dull and damp and another day,\n  But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\n  Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\n      General retreated.\n\n  I saw him at the river-side,\n  Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\n  My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,\n  And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for\n      the last time.\n\n  Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,\n  Many no doubt thought of capitulation.\n\n  But when my General pass'd me,\n  As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,\n  I saw something different from capitulation.\n\n       [Terminus]\n  Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,\n  The two, the past and present, have interchanged,\n  I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\n\n  And is this the ground Washington trod?\n  And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross'd,\n  As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\n\n  I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\n  I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.\n\n  See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\n  It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\n  The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\n      Washington's face,\n  The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept\n      the enemy,\n  They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\n  Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\n  Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds.\n  In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.\n\n  Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable\n      than your owners supposed;\n  In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,\n  Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.\n\n\n\n\nCavalry Crossing a Ford\n\n  A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,\n  They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to\n      the musical clank,\n  Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop\n      to drink,\n  Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the\n      negligent rest on the saddles,\n  Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the ford--while,\n  Scarlet and blue and snowy white,\n  The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.\n\n\n\n\nBivouac on a Mountain Side\n\n  I see before me now a traveling army halting,\n  Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,\n  Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,\n  Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,\n  The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the\n      mountain,\n  The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,\n  And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,\n      breaking out, the eternal stars.\n\n\n\n\nAn Army Corps on the March\n\n  With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,\n  With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an\n      irregular volley,\n  The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,\n  Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,\n  In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,\n  With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,\n  As the army corps advances.\n\n\n\n\nBy the Bivouac's Fitful Flame\n\n  By the bivouac's fitful flame,\n  A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but\n      first I note,\n  The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim outline,\n  The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,\n  Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,\n  The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily\n      watching me,)\n  While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,\n  Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that\n      are far away;\n  A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,\n  By the bivouac's fitful flame.\n\n\n\n\nCome Up from the Fields Father\n\n  Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,\n  And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.\n\n  Lo, 'tis autumn,\n  Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,\n  Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the\n      moderate wind,\n  Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,\n  (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?\n  Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)\n\n  Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and\n      with wondrous clouds,\n  Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.\n\n  Down in the fields all prospers well,\n  But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call.\n  And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.\n\n  Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,\n  She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.\n\n  Open the envelope quickly,\n  O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,\n  O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!\n  All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main\n      words only,\n  Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,\n      taken to hospital,\n  At present low, but will soon be better.\n\n  Ah now the single figure to me,\n  Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\n  Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\n  By the jamb of a door leans.\n\n  Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through\n      her sobs,\n  The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)\n  See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.\n\n  Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be\n      better, that brave and simple soul,)\n  While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,\n  The only son is dead.\n\n  But the mother needs to be better,\n  She with thin form presently drest in black,\n  By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,\n  In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,\n  O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,\n  To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.\n\n\n\n\nVigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night\n\n  Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;\n  When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,\n  One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I\n      shall never forget,\n  One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,\n  Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,\n  Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,\n  Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of\n      responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)\n  Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the\n      moderate night-wind,\n  Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the\n      battlefield spreading,\n  Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,\n  But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,\n  Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my\n      chin in my hands,\n  Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest\n      comrade--not a tear, not a word,\n  Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,\n  As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,\n  Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,\n  I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall\n      surely meet again,)\n  Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,\n  My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,\n  Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and\n      carefully under feet,\n  And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his\n      grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,\n  Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,\n  Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)\n  Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day\n      brighten'd,\n  I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,\n  And buried him where he fell.\n\n\n\n\nA March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown\n\n  A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,\n  A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,\n  Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,\n  Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,\n  We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,\n  'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,\n  Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and\n      poems ever made,\n  Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,\n  And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and\n      clouds of smoke,\n  By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some\n      in the pews laid down,\n  At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of\n      bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\n  I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a lily,)\n  Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all,\n  Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,\n      some of them dead,\n  Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,\n      odor of blood,\n  The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd,\n  Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\n      death-spasm sweating,\n  An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,\n  The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of\n      the torches,\n  These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\n  Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;\n  But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,\n  Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\n  Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\n  The unknown road still marching.\n\n\n\n\nA Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim\n\n  A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,\n  As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,\n  As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,\n  Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended lying,\n  Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,\n  Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.\n\n  Curious I halt and silent stand,\n  Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first\n      just lift the blanket;\n  Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,\n      and flesh all sunken about the eyes?\n  Who are you my dear comrade?\n  Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?\n  Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?\n  Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of\n      beautiful yellow-white ivory;\n  Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the\n      Christ himself,\n  Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.\n\n\n\n\nAs Toilsome I Wander'd Virginia's Woods\n\n  As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,\n  To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)\n  I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;\n  Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could\n      understand,)\n  The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign left,\n  On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,\n  Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.\n\n  Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,\n  Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,\n  Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or\n      in the crowded street,\n  Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription\n      rude in Virginia's woods,\n  Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.\n\n\n\n\nNot the Pilot\n\n  Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,\n      though beaten back and many times baffled;\n  Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,\n  By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he\n      reaches his destination,\n  More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose\n      march for these States,\n  For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries hence.\n\n\n\n\nYear That Trembled and Reel'd Beneath Me\n\n  Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!\n  Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,\n  A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,\n  Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,\n  Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?\n  And sullen hymns of defeat?\n\n\n\n\nThe Wound-Dresser\n\n       1\n  An old man bending I come among new faces,\n  Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,\n  Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,\n  (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,\n  But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,\n  To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)\n  Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,\n  Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)\n  Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,\n  Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?\n  What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,\n  Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?\n\n       2\n  O maidens and young men I love and that love me,\n  What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,\n  Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust,\n  In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the\n      rush of successful charge,\n  Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,\n  Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or\n      soldiers' joys,\n  (Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)\n\n  But in silence, in dreams' projections,\n  While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,\n  So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,\n  With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,\n  Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)\n\n  Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,\n  Straight and swift to my wounded I go,\n  Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,\n  Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,\n  Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,\n  To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,\n  To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,\n  An attendant follows

 I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,\n  One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,\n  Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that\n      would save you.\n\n       3\n  On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)\n  The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)\n  The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through examine,\n  Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life\n      struggles hard,\n  (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!\n  In mercy come quickly.)\n\n  From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,\n  I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,\n  Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side falling head,\n  His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the\n      bloody stump,\n  And has not yet look'd on it.\n\n  I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,\n  But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,\n  And the yellow-blue countenance see.\n\n  I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,\n  Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening,\n      so offensive,\n  While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.\n\n  I am faithful, I do not give out,\n  The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,\n  These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast\n      a fire, a burning flame.)\n\n       4\n  Thus in silence in dreams' projections,\n  Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,\n  The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,\n  I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,\n  Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,\n  (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,\n  Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)\n\n\n\n\nLong, Too Long America\n\n  Long, too long America,\n  Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and\n      prosperity only,\n  But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,\n      grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,\n  And now to conceive and show to the world what your children\n      en-masse really are,\n  (For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse\n      really are?)\n\n\n\n\nGive Me the Splendid Silent Sun\n\n       1\n  Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,\n  Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,\n  Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,\n  Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,\n  Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching\n      content,\n  Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the\n      Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,\n  Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can\n      walk undisturb'd,\n  Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never tire,\n  Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the\n      world a rural domestic life,\n  Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own ears only,\n  Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal\n      sanities!\n\n  These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and\n      rack'd by the war-strife,)\n  These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,\n  While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,\n  Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,\n  Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me up,\n  Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me forever faces;\n  (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,\n  see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)\n\n       2\n  Keep your splendid silent sun,\n  Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,\n  Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and orchards,\n  Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;\n  Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and\n      endless along the trottoirs!\n  Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and\n      lovers by the thousand!\n  Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every day!\n  Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!\n  Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of\n      the trumpets and drums!\n  (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush'd\n      and reckless,\n  Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very\n      old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)\n  Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!\n  O such for me!

MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN\n\n\nWhen Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\n\n       1\n  When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,\n  And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,\n  I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.\n\n  Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,\n  Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,\n  And thought of him I love.\n\n       2\n  O powerful western fallen star!\n  O shades of night--O moody, tearful night!\n  O great star disappear'd--O the black murk that hides the star!\n  O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of me!\n  O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.\n\n\n      3\n  In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings,\n  Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\n  With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,\n  With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the dooryard,\n  With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\n  A sprig with its flower I break.\n\n       4\n  In the swamp in secluded recesses,\n  A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.\n\n  Solitary the thrush,\n  The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\n  Sings by himself a song.\n\n  Song of the bleeding throat,\n  Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,\n  If thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die.)\n\n       5\n  Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,\n  Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd\n      from the ground, spotting the gray debris,\n  Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the\n      endless grass,\n  Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the\n      dark-brown fields uprisen,\n  Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,\n  Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,\n  Night and day journeys a coffin.\n\n       6\n  Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,\n  Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,\n  With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,\n  With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women standing,\n  With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,\n  With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the\n      unbared heads,\n  With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,\n  With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong\n      and solemn,\n  With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,\n  The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these\n      you journey,\n  With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,\n  Here, coffin that slowly passes,\n  I give you my sprig of lilac.\n\n       7\n  (Nor for you, for one alone,\n  Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,\n  For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane\n      and sacred death.\n\n  All over bouquets of roses,\n  O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,\n  But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,\n  Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,\n  With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,\n  For you and the coffins all of you O death.)\n\n       8\n  O western orb sailing the heaven,\n  Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd,\n  As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,\n  As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,\n  As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the\n      other stars all look'd on,)\n  As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I know not\n      what kept me from sleep,)\n  As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you\n      were of woe,\n  As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,\n  As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black\n      of the night,\n  As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,\n  Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.\n\n       9\n  Sing on there in the swamp,\n  O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,\n  I hear, I come presently, I understand you,\n  But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,\n  The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.\n\n       10\n  O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?\n  And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\n  And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\n\n  Sea-winds blown from east and west,\n  Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till\n      there on the prairies meeting,\n  These and with these and the breath of my chant,\n  I'll perfume the grave of him I love.\n\n       11\n  O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?\n  And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\n  To adorn the burial-house of him I love?\n  Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,\n  With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,\n  With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking\n      sun, burning, expanding the air,\n  With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves\n      of the trees prolific,\n  In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a\n      wind-dapple here and there,\n  With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,\n      and shadows,\n  And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,\n  And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen\n      homeward returning.\n\n       12\n  Lo, body and soul--this land,\n  My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,\n      and the ships,\n  The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light,\n      Ohio's shores and flashing Missouri,\n  And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.\n\n  Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,\n  The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,\n  The gentle soft-born measureless light,\n  The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,\n  The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,\n  Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.\n\n       13\n  Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,\n  Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,\n  Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\n\n  Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,\n  Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\n\n  O liquid and free and tender!\n  O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!\n  You only I hear--yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)\n  Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.\n\n       14\n  Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,\n  In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and\n      the farmers preparing their crops,\n  In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,\n  In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and the storms,)\n  Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the\n      voices of children and women,\n  The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,\n  And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy\n      with labor,\n  And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with\n      its meals and minutia of daily usages,\n  And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--\n      lo, then and there,\n  Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\n  Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,\n  And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\n\n  Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\n  And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\n  And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of\n      companions,\n  I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\n  Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\n  To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\n\n  And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,\n  The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,\n  And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\n\n  From deep secluded recesses,\n  From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\n  Came the carol of the bird.\n\n  And the charm of the carol rapt me,\n  As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\n  And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\n\n  Come lovely and soothing death,\n  Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\n  In the day, in the night, to all, to each,\n  Sooner or later delicate death.\n\n  Prais'd be the fathomless universe,\n  For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\n  And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!\n  For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.\n\n  Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\n  Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\n  Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\n  I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\n\n  Approach strong deliveress,\n  When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\n  Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\n  Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.\n\n  From me to thee glad serenades,\n  Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,\n  And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread shy are fitting,\n  And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\n\n  The night in silence under many a star,\n  The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\n  And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,\n  And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\n\n  Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,\n  Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the\n      prairies wide,\n  Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\n  I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.\n\n       15\n  To the tally of my soul,\n  Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\n  With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\n\n  Loud in the pines and cedars dim,\n  Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\n  And I with my comrades there in the night.\n\n  While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\n  As to long panoramas of visions.\n\n  And I saw askant the armies,\n  I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\n  Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw them,\n  And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\n  And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\n  And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.\n\n  I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\n  And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\n  I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\n  But I saw they were not as was thought,\n  They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,\n  The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,\n  And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,\n  And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.\n\n       16\n  Passing the visions, passing the night,\n  Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,\n  Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\n  Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\n  As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,\n      flooding the night,\n  Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again\n      bursting with joy,\n  Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\n  As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\n  Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\n  I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\n\n  I cease from my song for thee,\n  From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\n  O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\n\n  Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\n  The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\n  And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,\n  With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\n  With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\n  Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for\n      the dead I loved so well,\n  For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for\n      his dear sake,\n  Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\n  There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.\n\n\n\n\nO Captain! My Captain!\n\n  O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,\n  The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,\n  The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\n  While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\n      But O heart! heart! heart!\n       O the bleeding drops of red,\n         Where on the deck my Captain lies,\n           Fallen cold and dead.\n\n  O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\n  Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,\n  For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,\n  For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\n      Here Captain! dear father!\n       This arm beneath your head!\n         It is some dream that on the deck,\n           You've fallen cold and dead.\n\n  My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,\n  My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,\n  The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,\n  From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;\n       Exult O shores, and ring O bells!\n         But I with mournful tread,\n           Walk the deck my Captain lies,\n             Fallen cold and dead.\n\n\n\n\nHush'd Be the Camps To-Day [May 4, 1865\n\n  Hush'd be the camps to-day,\n  And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,\n  And each with

across the sky.\n  But sing poet in our name,\n\n  Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it truly.\n\n  As they invault the coffin there,\n  Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,\n  For the heavy hearts of soldiers.\n\n\n\n\nThis Dust Was Once the Man\n\n  This dust was once the man,\n  Gentle, plain, just and resolute, under whose cautious

mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, and the\n      dead that return no more,\n  A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,\n  Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America,\n      chant me the carol of victory,\n  And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,\n  And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy.\n\n  (Democracy, the destin'd conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere,\n  And death and infidelity at every step.)\n\n       2\n  A Nation announcing itself,\n  I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,\n  I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.\n\n  A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,\n  What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,\n  We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,\n  We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,\n  We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of\n      ourselves,\n  We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,\n  We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world,\n  From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.\n\n  Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,\n  Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or\n      sinful in ourselves only.\n\n  (O Mother--O Sisters dear!\n  If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,\n  It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)\n\n       3\n  Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?\n  There can be any number of supremes--one does not countervail\n      another any more than one eyesight countervails another, or\n      one life countervails another.\n\n  All is eligible to all,\n  All is for individuals, all is for you,\n  No condition is prohibited, not God's or any.\n\n  All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the universe.\n\n  Produce great Persons, the rest follows.\n\n       4\n  Piety and conformity

If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me.\n\n  Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,\n  Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey--juice,\n  Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,\n  Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.\n\n       5\n  Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,\n  America brings builders, and brings its own styles.\n\n  The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and\n      pass'd to other spheres,\n  A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.\n\n  America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all\n      hazards,\n  Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true use\n      of precedents,\n  Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under\n      their forms,\n  Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne\n      from the house,\n  Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was\n      fittest for its days,\n  That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who\n      approaches,\n  And that he shall be fittest for his days.\n\n  Any period one nation must lead,\n  One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.\n\n  These States are the amplest poem,\n  Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,\n  Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the\n      day and night,\n  Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars,\n  Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul loves,\n  Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the\n      soul loves.\n\n       6\n  Land of lands and bards to corroborate!\n  Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a west-bred face,\n  To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd both mother's and father's,\n  His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,\n  Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,\n  Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,\n  Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with\n      incomparable love,\n  Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,\n  Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,\n  Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,\n  Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,\n      Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,\n  If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he\n      stretching with them North or South,\n  Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever is between them,\n  Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock,\n      live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,\n  Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,\n  He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with\n      northern transparent ice,\n  Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,\n  Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the\n      fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle,\n  His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil,\n  Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,\n  Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,\n  Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,\n  The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation of\n      the Constitution,\n  The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,\n  The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable,\n  The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,\n      hunters, trappers,\n  Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the\n      gestation of new States,\n  Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming\n      up from the uttermost parts,\n  Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially\n      the young men,\n  Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they\n      have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the\n      presence of superiors,\n  The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and\n      decision of their phrenology,\n  The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong'd,\n  The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,\n      good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite make,\n  The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,\n  The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement\n      of the population,\n  The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,\n  Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points,\n  Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the Northeast,\n      Northwest, Southwest,\n  Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,\n  Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the\n      ruins of all the rest,\n  On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours\n      be the stake, and respite no more.\n\n       7\n  (Lo, high toward heaven, this day,\n  Libertad, from the conqueress' field return'd,\n  I mark the new aureola around your head,\n  No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,\n  With war's flames and the lambent lightnings playing,\n  And your port immovable where you stand,\n  With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch'd and lifted fist,\n  And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner utterly\n      crush'd beneath you,\n  The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his\n      senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife,\n  The wide-swelling one, the braggart that would yesterday do so much,\n  To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth,\n  An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)\n\n       8\n  Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever\n      keeps vista,\n  Others adorn the past, but you O days of the present, I adorn you,\n  O days of the future I believe in you--I isolate myself for your sake,\n  O America because you build for mankind I build for you,\n  O well-beloved stone-cutters, I lead them who plan with decision\n      and science,\n  Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.\n  (Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!\n  But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain,\n      pains, dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing.)\n\n       9\n  I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,\n  I heard the voice arising demanding bards,\n  By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be\n      fused into the compact organism of a Nation.\n\n  To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,\n  That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle,\n      as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.\n\n  Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most\n      need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest,\n  Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their\n      poets shall.\n\n  (Soul of love and tongue of fire!\n  Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!\n  Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren, barren?)\n\n       10\n  Of these States the poet is the equable man,\n  Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of\n      their full returns,\n  Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,\n  He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither\n      more nor less,\n  He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,\n  He is the equalizer of his age and land,\n  He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,\n  In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,\n      thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts,\n      commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health,\n      immortality, government,\n  In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as\n      good as the engineer's, he can make every word he speaks draw blood,\n  The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,\n  He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)\n  He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round\n      helpless thing,\n  As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,\n  His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,\n  In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,\n  He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,\n  He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women\n      as dreams or dots.\n\n  For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,\n  For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,\n  The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.\n\n  Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,\n  They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,\n  (Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always\n      ready to fall for Liberty.)\n\n       11\n  For the great Idea,\n  That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.\n\n  Songs of stern defiance ever ready,\n  Songs of the rapid arming and the march,\n  The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,\n  Warlike flag of the great Idea.\n\n  (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!\n  I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,\n  I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight--O the\n      hard-contested fight!\n  The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles--the hurtled balls scream,\n  The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant\n      from the line,\n  Hark, the ringing word Charge!--now the tussle and the furious\n      maddening yells,\n  Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,\n  Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,\n  Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)\n\n       12\n  Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in\n      the States?\n  The place is august, the terms obdurate.\n\n  Who would assume to teach here may

for the errant?\n\n  What is this you bring my America?\n  Is it uniform with my country?\n  Is it not something that has been better told or done before?\n  Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?\n  Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?--Is the good old cause in it?\n  Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,\n      literats, of enemies' lands?\n  Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?\n  Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?\n  Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the Union

real employments contributed to it? original makers, not mere\n      amanuenses?\n  Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?\n  What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities? Chicago,\n      Kanada, Arkansas?\n  Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians\n      standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics, Manhattanese, Western\n      men, Southerners, significant alike in their apathy, and in the\n      promptness of their love?\n  Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,\n      each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,\n      infidel, who has ever ask'd any thing of America?\n  What mocking and scornful negligence?\n  The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons,\n  By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.\n\n       13\n  Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill'd from poems pass away,\n  The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,\n  Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of literature,\n  America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it\n      or conceal from it, it is impassive enough,\n  Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,\n  If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them, there\n      is no fear of mistake,\n  (The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country\n      absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)\n\n  He masters whose spirit masters, he tastes sweetest who results\n      sweetest in the long run,\n  The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;\n  In the need of songs, philosophy, an appropriate native grand-opera,\n      shipcraft, any craft,\n  He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original\n      practical example.\n\n  Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets,\n  People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers,\n  There will shortly be no more priests, I say their work is done,\n  Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies here,\n  Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be superb,\n  Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;\n  How dare you place any thing before a man?\n\n       14\n  Fall behind me States!\n  A man before all--myself, typical, before all.\n\n  Give me the pay I have served for,\n  Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest,\n  I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,\n  I have given aims to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid\n      and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,\n  Hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and indulgence\n      toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown,\n  Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young,\n      and with the mothers of families,\n  Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by trees,\n      stars, rivers,\n  Dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,\n  Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for\n      others on the same terms,\n  Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every State,\n  (Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe his last,\n  This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,\n  To life recalling many a prostrate form;)\n  I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself,\n  Rejecting none, permitting all.\n\n  (Say O Mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?\n  Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?)\n\n       15\n  I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,\n  It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,\n  It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,\n  It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,\n  Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.\n\n  Underneath all, individuals,\n  I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,\n  The American compact is altogether with individuals,\n  The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,\n  The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one\n      single individual--namely to You.\n\n  (Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your hand,\n  I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)\n\n       16\n  Underneath all, Nativity,\n  I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so be it;\n  I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,\n  Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.\n\n  Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women,\n  (I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing\n      love for men and women,\n  After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and\n      women.) in myself,\n\n  I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,\n  (Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favor\n      the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States.)\n\n  Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,\n      ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,\n  Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same\n      monotonous old song.)\n\n       17\n  O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,\n  Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,\n  Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,\n  Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships,\n      are you and me,\n  Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,\n  The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth\n      forget), was you and me,\n  Natural and artificial are you and me,\n  Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,\n  Past, present, future, are you and me.\n\n  I dare not shirk any part of myself,\n  Not any part of America good or bad,\n  Not to build for that which builds for mankind,\n  Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,\n  Not to justify science nor the march of equality,\n  Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov'd of time.\n\n  I am for those that have never been master'd,\n  For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,\n  For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.\n\n  I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,\n  Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.\n\n  I will not be outfaced by irrational things,\n  I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,\n  I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,\n  This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount, and it I\n      teach again.\n\n  (Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,\n  I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams\n      your dilating form,\n  Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)\n\n       18\n  I will confront these shows of the day and night,\n  I will know if I am to be less than they,\n  I will see if I am not as majestic as they,\n  I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,\n  I will see if I am to be less generous than they,\n  I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning,\n  I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,\n      and I am not to be enough for myself.\n\n  I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,\n  Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the master myself,\n  America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?\n  These States, what are they except myself?\n\n  I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my sake,\n  I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.\n\n\n  (Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,\n  I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,\n  I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war and crime\n      your work goes on, and must yet go on.)\n\n       19\n  Thus by blue Ontario's shore,\n  While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward me,\n  I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my theme\n      was upon me,\n  Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.\n\n  And I saw the free souls of poets,\n  The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,\n  Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.\n\n       20\n  O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!\n  Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch'd\n      you forth,\n  Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,\n  Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.\n\n  Bards for my own land only I invoke,\n  (For the war the war is over, the field is clear'd,)\n  Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,\n  To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.\n\n  Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the\n      war, the war is over!)\n  Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,\n  Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's fork'd stripes!\n  Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards--bards of California! inland bards--\n      bards of the war!\n  You by my charm I invoke.\n\n\n\n\nReversals\n\n  Let that which stood in front go behind,\n  Let that which was behind advance to the front,\n  Let bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions,\n  Let the old propositions be postponed,\n  Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself,\n  Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS\n\n\nAs Consequent, Etc.\n\n  As consequent from store of summer rains,\n  Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing,\n  Or many a herb-lined brook's reticulations,\n  Or subterranean sea-rills making for the sea,\n  Songs of continued years I sing.\n\n  Life's ever-modern rapids first, (soon, soon to blend,\n  With the old streams of death.)\n\n  Some threading Ohio's farm-fields or the woods,\n  Some down Colorado's canons from sources of perpetual snow,\n  Some half-hid in Oregon, or away southward in Texas,\n  Some in the north finding their way to Erie, Niagara, Ottawa,\n  Some to Atlantica's bays, and so to the great salt brine.\n\n  In you whoe'er you are my book perusing,\n  In I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,\n  All, all toward the mystic ocean tending.\n\n  Currents for starting a continent new,\n  Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,\n  Fusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,\n  (Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous'd and ominous too,\n  Out of the depths the storm's abysmic waves, who knows whence?\n  Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter'd sail.)\n\n  Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring,\n  A windrow-drift of weeds and shells.\n\n  O little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless,\n  Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held,\n  Murmurs and echoes still call up, eternity's music faint and far,\n  Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim, strains for the soul of\n      the prairies,\n  Whisper'd reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding,\n  Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,\n  Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,\n  (For not my life and years alone I give--all, all I give,)\n  These waifs from the deep, cast high and dry,\n  Wash'd on America's shores?\n\n\n\n\nThe Return of the Heroes\n\n       1\n  For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,\n  Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,\n  Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,\n  Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,\n  Turning a verse for thee.\n\n  O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,\n  O harvest of my lands--O boundless summer growths,\n  O lavish brown parturient earth--O infinite teeming womb,\n  A song to narrate thee.\n\n       2\n  Ever upon this stage,\n  Is acted God's calm annual drama,\n  Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,\n  Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,\n  The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,\n  The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,\n  The liliput countless armies of the grass,\n  The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,\n  The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,\n  The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the\n      silvery fringes,\n  The high-dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,\n  The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,\n  The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.\n\n       3\n  Fecund America--today,\n  Thou art all over set in births and joys!\n  Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing-garment,\n  Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,\n  A myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne,\n  As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into port,\n  As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth, so have\n      the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee;\n  Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!\n  Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,\n  Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,\n  Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon\n      thy world, and lookest East and lookest West,\n  Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million\n      farms, and missest nothing,\n  Thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as\n      God is hospitable.)\n\n       4\n  When late I sang sad was my voice,\n  Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and\n      smoke of war;\n  In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,\n  Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.\n\n  But now I sing not war,\n  Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,\n  Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;\n  No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.\n\n  Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping armies?\n  Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow'd.\n\n  (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,\n  With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your muskets;\n  How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd.\n\n  Pass--then rattle drums again,\n  For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,\n  Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,\n  O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your fever,\n  O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and\n      the crutch,\n  Lo, your pallid army follows.)\n\n       5\n  But on these days of brightness,\n  On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes the\n      high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,\n  Should the dead intrude?\n\n  Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,\n  They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,\n  And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.\n\n  Nor do I forget you Departed,\n  Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,\n  But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace,\n      like pleasing phantoms,\n  Your memories rising glide silently by me.\n\n       6\n  I saw the day the return of the heroes,\n  (Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,\n  Them that day I saw not.)\n\n  I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,\n  I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,\n  Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of\n      mighty camps.\n\n  No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,\n  Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,\n  Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,\n  Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.\n\n  A pause--the armies wait,\n  A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,\n  The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,\n  They melt, they disappear.\n\n  Exult O lands! victorious lands!\n  Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,\n  But here and hence your victory.\n\n  Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,\n  Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,\n  Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,\n  With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars.\n\n       7\n  Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!\n  The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,\n  The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.\n\n  All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,\n  I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,\n  Man's innocent and strong arenas.\n\n  I see the heroes at other toils,\n  I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.\n\n  I see where the Mother of All,\n  With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,\n  And counts the varied gathering of the products.\n\n  Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,\n  Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,\n  Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,\n  Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,\n  Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,\n  And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,\n  And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,\n  And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring grass.\n\n       8\n  Toil on heroes! harvest the products!\n  Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,\n  With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.\n\n  Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!\n  The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.\n\n  Well-pleased America thou beholdest,\n  Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,\n  The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;\n  Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the\n      revolving hay-rakes,\n  The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines\n  The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well\n      separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,\n  Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the\n      rice-cleanser.\n\n  Beneath thy look O Maternal,\n  With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.\n\n  All gather and all harvest,\n  Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in security,\n  Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.\n\n  Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great\n      face only,\n  Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear\n      under thee,\n  Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its\n      light-green sheath,\n  Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,\n  Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;\n  Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the\n      golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,\n  Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,\n  Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,\n  Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches\n      of grapes from the vines,\n  Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,\n  Under the beaming sun and under thee.\n\n\n\n\nThere Was a Child Went Forth\n\n  There was a child went forth every day,\n  And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became,\n  And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day,\n  Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.\n\n  The early lilacs became part of this child,\n  And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red\n      clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,\n  And the Third-month lambs and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the\n      mare's foal and the cow's calf,\n  And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,\n  And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the\n      beautiful curious liquid,\n  And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him.\n\n  The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,\n  Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the\n      esculent roots of the garden,\n  And the apple-trees cover'd with blossoms and the fruit afterward,\n      and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road,\n  And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the\n      tavern whence he had lately risen,\n  And the schoolmistress that pass'd on her way to the school,\n  And the friendly boys that pass'd, and the quarrelsome boys,\n  And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,\n  And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.\n\n  His own parents, he that had father'd him and she that had conceiv'd\n      him in her womb and birth'd him,\n  They gave this child more of themselves than that,\n  They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him.\n\n  The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,\n  The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome\n      odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,\n  The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust,\n  The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,\n  The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the\n      yearning and swelling heart,\n  Affection that will not be gainsay'd, the sense of what is real, the\n      thought if after all it should prove unreal,\n  The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious\n      whether and how,\n  Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?\n  Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes\n      and specks what are they?\n  The streets themselves and the facades of houses, and goods in the windows,\n  Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves, the huge crossing at\n      the ferries,\n  The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,\n  Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of\n      white or brown two miles off,\n  The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little\n      boat slack-tow'd astern,\n  The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,\n  The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away\n      solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,\n  The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh\n      and shore mud,\n  These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who\n      now goes, and will always go forth every day.\n\n\n\n\nOld Ireland\n\n  Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,\n  Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,\n  Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,\n  Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,\n  At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,\n  Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and heir,\n  Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.\n\n  Yet a word ancient mother,\n  You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead\n      between your knees,\n  O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,\n  For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,\n  It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,\n  The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,\n  Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,\n  What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,\n  The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,\n  And now with rosy and new blood,\n  Moves to-day in a new country.\n\n\n\n\nThe City Dead-House\n\n  By the city dead-house by the gate,\n  As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor,\n  I curious pause, for lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought,\n  Her corpse they deposit unclaim'd, it lies on the damp brick pavement,\n  The divine woman, her body, I see the body, I look on it alone,\n  That house once full of passion and beauty, all else I notice not,\n  Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors\n      morbific impress me,\n  But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house\n      --that ruin!\n  That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!\n  Or white-domed capitol with majestic figure surmounted, or all the\n      old high-spired cathedrals,\n  That little house alone more than them all--poor, desperate house!\n  Fair, fearful wreck--tenement of a soul--itself a soul,\n  Unclaim'd, avoided house--take one breath from my tremulous lips,\n  Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,\n  Dead house of love--house of madness and sin, crumbled, crush'd,\n  House of life, erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house,\n      dead even then,\n  Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house--but dead, dead, dead.\n\n\n\n\nThis Compost\n\n       1\n  Something startles me where I thought I was safest,\n  I withdraw from the still woods I loved,\n  I will not go now on the pastures to walk,\n  I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,\n  I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.\n\n  O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?\n  How can you be alive you growths of spring?\n  How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?\n  Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?\n  Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?\n\n  Where have you disposed of their carcasses?\n  Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?\n  Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?\n  I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd,\n  I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through\n      the sod and turn it up underneath,\n  I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.\n\n       2\n  Behold this compost! behold it well!\n  Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person--yet behold!\n  The grass of spring covers the prairies,\n  The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,\n  The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,\n  The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,\n  The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,\n  The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,\n  The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on\n      their nests,\n  The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,\n  The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the\n      colt from the mare,\n  Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,\n  Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in\n      the dooryards,\n  The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata\n      of sour dead.\n\n  What chemistry!\n  That the winds are really not infectious,\n  That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which\n      is so amorous after me,\n  That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,\n  That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited\n      themselves in it,\n  That all is clean forever and forever,\n  That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,\n  That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,\n  That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that\n      melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,\n  That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,\n  Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once\n      catching disease.\n\n  Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,\n  It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,\n  It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless\n      successions of diseas'd corpses,\n  It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,\n  It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,\n  It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings\n      from them at last.\n\n\n\n\nTo a Foil'd European Revolutionaire\n\n  Courage yet, my brother or my sister!\n  Keep on--Liberty is to be subserv'd whatever occurs;\n  That is nothing that is quell'd by one or two failures, or any\n      number of failures,\n  Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any\n      unfaithfulness,\n  Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.\n\n  What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,\n  Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is\n      positive and composed, knows no discouragement,\n  Waiting patiently, waiting its time.\n\n  (Not songs of loyalty alone are these,\n  But songs of insurrection also,\n  For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,\n  And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,\n  And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)\n\n  The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,\n  The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,\n  The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and\n      leadballs do their work,\n  The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,\n  The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,\n  The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,\n  The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;\n  But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the\n      infidel enter'd into full possession.\n\n  When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the\n      second or third to go,\n  It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.\n\n  When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,\n  And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged\n      from any part of the earth,\n  Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from\n      that part of the earth,\n  And the infidel come into full possession.\n\n  Then courage European revolter, revoltress!\n  For till all ceases neither must you cease.\n\n  I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself,\n      nor what any thing is for,)\n  But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,\n  In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are great.\n\n  Did we think victory great?\n  So it is--but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that\n      defeat is great,\n  And that death and dismay are great.\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed Land\n\n  Nations ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten\n      thousand years before these States,\n  Garner'd clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and\n      travel'd their course and pass'd on,\n  What vast-built cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes\n      and nomads,\n  What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,\n  What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,\n  What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and phrenology,\n  What of liberty and slavery among them, what they thought of death\n      and the soul,\n  Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and\n      undevelop'd,\n  Not a mark, not a record remains--and yet all remains.\n\n  O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more\n      than we are for nothing,\n  I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much\n      as we now belong to it.\n\n  Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,\n  Some with oval countenances learn'd and calm,\n  Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,\n  Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,\n  Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms,\n      laboring, reaping, filling barns,\n  Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories,\n      libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.\n  Are those billions of men really gone?\n  Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?\n  Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?\n  Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?\n\n  I believe of all those men and women that fill'd the unnamed lands,\n      every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us.\n  In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of\n      what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn'd, in life.\n\n  I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of\n      them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;\n  Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products,\n      games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,\n  I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world,\n      counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,\n  I suspect I shall meet them there,\n  I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.\n\n\n\n\nSong of Prudence\n\n  Manhattan's streets I saunter'd pondering,\n  On Time, Space, Reality--on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence.\n\n  The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,\n  Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that\n      suits immortality.\n\n  The soul is of itself,\n  All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,\n  All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,\n  Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,\n      month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,\n  But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the\n      indirect lifetime.\n\n  The indirect is just as much as the direct,\n  The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the\n      body, if not more.\n\n  Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of\n      the onanist,\n  Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,\n      betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,\n  But has results beyond death as really as before death.\n\n  Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.\n\n  No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that\n      is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,\n  In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope\n      of it forever.\n\n  Who has been wise receives interest,\n  Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,\n      young, old, it is the same,\n  The interest will come round--all will come round.\n\n  Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,\n      all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,\n  All the brave actions of war and peace,\n  All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,\n      young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn'd persons,\n  All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw\n      others fill the seats of the boats,\n  All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a\n      friend's sake, or opinion's sake,\n  All pains of enthusiasts scoff'd at by their neighbors,\n  All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,\n  All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,\n  All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,\n  All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,\n      date, location,\n  All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,\n  All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his\n      mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,\n  All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe,\n      or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix'd stars,\n      by those there as we are here,\n  All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are,\n      or by any one,\n  These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which\n      they sprang, or shall spring.\n\n  Did you guess any thing lived only its moment?\n  The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,\n  No consummation exists without being from some long previous\n      consummation, and that from some other,\n  Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the\n      beginning than any.\n\n  Whatever satisfies souls is true;\n  Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,\n  Itself only finally satisfies the soul,\n  The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson\n      but its own.\n\n  Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,\n      space, reality,\n  That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.\n\n  What is prudence is indivisible,\n  Declines to separate one part of life from every part,\n  Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,\n  Matches every thought or act by its correlative,\n  Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,\n  Knows that the young man who composedly peril'd his life and lost it\n      has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,\n  That he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age in\n      riches and ease, has probably achiev'd nothing for himself worth\n      mentioning,\n  Knows that only that person has really learn'd who has learn'd to\n      prefer results,\n  Who favors body and soul the same,\n  Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,\n  Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor\n      avoids death.\n\n\n\n\nThe Singer in the Prison\n\n          O sight of pity, shame and dole!\n          O fearful thought--a convict soul.\n\n       1\n  Rang the refrain along the hall, the prison,\n  Rose to the roof, the vaults of heaven above,\n  Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong the\n      like whereof was never heard,\n  Reaching the far-off sentry and the armed guards, who ceas'd their pacing,\n  Making the hearer's pulses stop for ecstasy and awe.\n\n       2\n  The sun was low in the west one winter day,\n  When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land,\n  (There by the hundreds seated, sear-faced murderers, wily counterfeiters,\n  Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls, the keepers round,\n  Plenteous, well-armed, watching with vigilant eyes,)\n  Calmly a lady walk'd holding a little innocent child by either hand,\n  Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform,\n  She, first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude,\n  In voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn.\n\n       A soul confined by bars and bands,\n       Cries, help! O help! and wrings her hands,\n       Blinded her eyes, bleeding her breast,\n       Nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest.\n\n       Ceaseless she paces to and fro,\n       O heart-sick days! O nights of woe!\n       Nor hand of friend, nor loving face,\n       Nor favor comes, nor word of grace.\n\n       It was not I that sinn'd the sin,\n       The ruthless body dragg'd me in;\n       Though long I strove courageously,\n       The body was too much for me.\n\n       Dear prison'd soul bear up a space,\n       For soon or late the certain grace;\n       To set thee free and bear thee home,\n       The heavenly pardoner death shall come.\n\n          Convict no more, nor shame, nor dole!\n          Depart--a God-enfranchis'd soul!\n\n       3\n  The singer ceas'd,\n  One glance swept from her clear calm eyes o'er all those upturn'd faces,\n  Strange sea of prison faces, a thousand varied, crafty, brutal,\n      seam'd and beauteous faces,\n  Then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,\n  While her gown touch'd them rustling in the silence,\n  She vanish'd with her children in the dusk.\n\n  While upon all, convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr'd,\n  (Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,)\n  A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute,\n  With deep half-stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow'd and moved to weeping,\n  And youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home,\n  The mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy childhood,\n  The long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence;\n  A wondrous minute then--but after in the solitary night, to many,\n      many there,\n  Years after, even in the hour of death, the sad refrain, the tune,\n      the voice, the words,\n  Resumed, the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle,\n  The wailing melody again, the singer in the prison sings,\n\n       O sight of pity, shame and dole!\n       O fearful thought--a convict soul.\n\n\n\n\nWarble for Lilac-Time\n\n  Warble me now for joy of lilac-time, (returning in reminiscence,)\n  Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature's sake, souvenirs of earliest summer,\n  Gather the welcome signs, (as children with pebbles or stringing shells,)\n  Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the elastic air,\n  Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,\n  Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole flashing his\n      golden wings,\n  The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,\n  Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above,\n  All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,\n  The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugar-making,\n  The robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,\n  With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,\n  Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest\n      of his mate,\n  The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow-green sprouts,\n  For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it\n      and from it?\n  Thou, soul, unloosen'd--the restlessness after I know not what;\n  Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!\n  O if one could but fly like a bird!\n  O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!\n  To glide with thee O soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the waters;\n  Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the\n      morning drops of dew,\n  The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves,\n  Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,\n  Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,\n  To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,\n  A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence.\n\n\n\n\nOutlines for a Tomb [G. P., Buried 1870]\n\n       1\n  What may we chant, O thou within this tomb?\n  What tablets, outlines, hang for thee, O millionnaire?\n  The life thou lived'st we know not,\n  But that thou walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts of\n      brokers,\n  Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory.\n\n       2\n  Silent, my soul,\n  With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd,\n  Turning from all the samples, monuments of heroes.\n\n  While through the interior vistas,\n  Noiseless uprose, phantasmic, (as by night Auroras of the north,)\n  Lambent tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes,\n  Spiritual projections.\n\n  In one, among the city streets a laborer's home appear'd,\n  After his day's work done, cleanly, sweet-air'd, the gaslight burning,\n  The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove.\n\n  In one, the sacred parturition scene,\n  A happy painless mother birth'd a perfect child.\n\n  In one, at a bounteous morning meal,\n  Sat peaceful parents with contented sons.\n\n  In one, by twos and threes, young people,\n  Hundreds concentring, walk'd the paths and streets and roads,\n  Toward a tall-domed school.\n\n  In one a trio beautiful,\n  Grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat,\n  Chatting and sewing.\n\n  In one, along a suite of noble rooms,\n  'Mid plenteous books and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes,\n  Were groups of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old,\n  Reading, conversing.\n\n  All, all the shows of laboring life,\n  City and country, women's, men's and children's,\n  Their wants provided for, hued in the sun and tinged for once with joy,\n  Marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the house-room, lodging-room,\n  Labor and toll, the bath, gymnasium, playground, library, college,\n  The student, boy or girl, led forward to be taught,\n  The sick cared for, the shoeless shod, the orphan father'd and mother'd,\n  The hungry fed, the houseless housed;\n  (The intentions perfect and divine,\n  The workings, details, haply human.)\n\n       3\n  O thou within this tomb,\n  From thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver,\n  Tallying the gifts of earth, large as the earth,\n  Thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and tides.\n\n  Nor by your streams alone, you rivers,\n  By you, your banks Connecticut,\n  By you and all your teeming life old Thames,\n  By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you Patapsco,\n  You Hudson, you endless Mississippi--nor you alone,\n  But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory.\n\n\n\n\nOut from Behind This Mask [To Confront a Portrait]\n\n       1\n  Out from behind this bending rough-cut mask,\n  These lights and shades, this drama of the whole,\n  This common curtain of the face contain'd in me for me, in you for\n      you, in each for each,\n  (Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears--0 heaven!\n  The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid!)\n  This glaze of God's serenest purest sky,\n  This film of Satan's seething pit,\n  This heart's geography's map, this limitless small continent, this\n      soundless sea;\n  Out from the convolutions of this globe,\n  This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon, than Jupiter, Venus, Mars,\n  This condensation of the universe, (nay here the only universe,\n  Here the idea, all in this mystic handful wrapt;)\n  These burin'd eyes, flashing to you to pass to future time,\n  To launch and spin through space revolving sideling, from these to emanate,\n  To you whoe'er you are--a look.\n\n       2\n  A traveler of thoughts and years, of peace and war,\n  Of youth long sped and middle age declining,\n  (As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the second,\n  Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,)\n  Lingering a moment here and now, to you I opposite turn,\n  As on the road or at some crevice door by chance, or open'd window,\n  Pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially I greet,\n  To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine,\n  Then travel travel on.\n\n\n\n\nVocalism\n\n       1\n  Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine\n      power to speak words;\n  Are you full-lung'd and limber-lipp'd from long trial? from vigorous\n      practice? from physique?\n  Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?\n  Come duly to the divine power to speak words?\n  For only at last after many years, after chastity, friendship,\n      procreation, prudence, and nakedness,\n  After treading ground and breasting river and lake,\n  After a loosen'd throat, after absorbing eras, temperaments, races,\n      after knowledge, freedom, crimes,\n  After complete faith, after clarifyings, elevations, and removing\n      obstructions,\n  After these and more, it is just possible there comes to a man,\n      woman, the divine power to speak words;\n  Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all--none\n      refuse, all attend,\n  Armies, ships, antiquities, libraries, paintings, machines, cities,\n      hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration, form in\n      close ranks,\n  They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the\n      mouth of that man or that woman.\n\n       2\n  O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?\n  Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow,\n  As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere\n      around the globe.\n\n  All waits for the right voices;\n  Where is the practis'd and perfect organ? where is the develop'd soul?\n  For I see every word utter'd thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,\n      impossible on less terms.\n\n  I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck,\n  Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,\n  Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies\n      slumbering forever ready in all words.\n\n\n\n\nTo Him That Was Crucified\n\n  My spirit to yours dear brother,\n  Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you,\n  I do not sound your name, but I understand you,\n  I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you, and to salute\n      those who are with you, before and since, and those to come also,\n  That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession,\n  We few equals indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,\n  We, enclosers of all continents, all castes, allowers of all theologies,\n  Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,\n  We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the\n      disputers nor any thing that is asserted,\n  We hear the bawling and din, we are reach'd at by divisions,\n      jealousies, recriminations on every side,\n  They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade,\n  Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and\n      down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras,\n  Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races,\n      ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are.\n\n\n\n\nYou Felons on Trial in Courts\n\n  You felons on trial in courts,\n  You convicts in prison-cells, you sentenced assassins chain'd and\n      handcuff'd with iron,\n  Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison?\n  Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd with\n      iron, or my ankles with iron?\n\n  You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms,\n  Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself?\n\n  O culpable! I acknowledge--I expose!\n  (O admirers, praise not me--compliment not me--you make me wince,\n  I see what you do not--I know what you do not.)\n\n  Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch'd and choked,\n  Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell's tides continually run,\n  Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me,\n  I walk with delinquents with passionate love,\n  I feel I am of them--I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself,\n  And henceforth I will not deny them--for how can I deny myself?\n\n\n\n\nLaws for Creations\n\n  Laws for creations,\n  For strong artists and leaders, for fresh broods of teachers and\n      perfect literats for America,\n  For noble savans and coming musicians.\n  All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the\n      compact truth of the world,\n  There shall be no subject too pronounced--all works shall illustrate\n      the divine law of indirections.\n\n  What do you suppose creation is?\n  What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and\n      own no superior?\n  What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but\n      that man or woman is as good as God?\n  And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?\n  And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?\n  And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws?\n\n\n\n\nTo a Common Prostitute\n\n  Be composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and\n      lusty as Nature,\n  Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you,\n  Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to\n      rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.\n\n  My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that you\n      make preparation to be worthy to meet me,\n  And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.\n\n  Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me.\n\n\n\n\nI Was Looking a Long While\n\n  I was looking a long while for Intentions,\n  For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these\n      chants--and now I have found it,\n  It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither\n      accept nor reject,)\n  It is no more in the legends than in all else,\n  It is in the present--it is this earth to-day,\n  It is in Democracy--(the purport and aim of all the past,)\n  It is the life of one man or one woman to-day--the average man of to-day,\n  It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts,\n  It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery,\n      politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,\n  All for the modern--all for the average man of to-day.\n\n\n\n\nThought\n\n  Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth,\n      scholarships, and the like;\n  (To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them,\n      except as it results to their bodies and souls,\n  So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked,\n  And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks himself or herself,\n  And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the\n      rotten excrement of maggots,\n  And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true\n      realities of life, and go toward false realities,\n  And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them,\n      but nothing more,\n  And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk.)\n\n\n\n\nMiracles\n\n  Why, who makes much of a miracle?\n  As to me I know of nothing else but miracles,\n  Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,\n  Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,\n  Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water,\n  Or stand under trees in the woods,\n  Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night\n      with any one I love,\n  Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,\n  Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,\n  Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,\n  Or animals feeding in the fields,\n  Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,\n  Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet\n      and bright,\n  Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring;\n  These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,\n  The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.\n\n  To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,\n  Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,\n  Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,\n  Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.\n  To me the sea is a continual miracle,\n  The fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the\n      ships with men in them,\n  What stranger miracles are there?\n\n\n\n\nSparkles from the Wheel\n\n  Where the city's ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day,\n  Withdrawn I join a group of children watching, I pause aside with them.\n\n  By the curb toward the edge of the flagging,\n  A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife,\n  Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot and knee,\n  With measur'd tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with light but\n      firm hand,\n  Forth issue then in copious golden jets,\n  Sparkles from the wheel.\n\n  The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me,\n  The sad sharp-chinn'd old man with worn clothes and broad\n      shoulder-band of leather,\n  Myself effusing and fluid, a phantom curiously floating, now here\n      absorb'd and arrested,\n  The group, (an unminded point set in a vast surrounding,)\n  The attentive, quiet children, the loud, proud, restive base of the streets,\n  The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone, the light-press'd blade,\n  Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold,\n  Sparkles from the wheel.\n\n\n\n\nTo a Pupil\n\n  Is reform needed? is it through you?\n  The greater the reform needed, the greater the Personality you need\n      to accomplish it.\n\n  You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood,\n      complexion, clean and sweet?\n  Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that\n      when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command\n      enters with you, and every one is impress'd with your Personality?\n\n  O the magnet! the flesh over and over!\n  Go, dear friend, if need be give up all else, and commence to-day to\n      inure yourself to pluck, reality, self-esteem, definiteness,\n      elevatedness,\n  Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.\n\n\n\n\nUnfolded out of the Folds\n\n  Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is\n      always to come unfolded,\n  Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the\n      superbest man of the earth,\n  Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man,\n  Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be\n      form'd of perfect body,\n  Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the\n      poems of man, (only thence have my poems come;)\n  Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only thence\n      can appear the strong and arrogant man I love,\n  Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman\n      love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the man,\n  Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain come all the folds\n      of the man's brain, duly obedient,\n  Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded,\n  Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;\n  A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity, but\n      every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman;\n  First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Am I After All\n\n  What am I after all but a child, pleas'd with the sound of my own\n      name? repeating it over and over;\n  I stand apart to hear--it never tires me.\n\n  To you your name also;\n  Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in\n      the sound of your name?\n\n\n\n\nKosmos\n\n  Who includes diversity and is Nature,\n  Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of\n      the earth, and the great charity of the earth, and the equilibrium also,\n  Who has not look'd forth from the windows the eyes for nothing,\n      or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,\n  Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,\n  Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism,\n      spiritualism, and of the aesthetic or intellectual,\n  Who having consider'd the body finds all its organs and parts good,\n  Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body\n      understands by subtle analogies all other theories,\n  The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;\n  Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in\n      other globes with their suns and moons,\n  Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day\n      but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,\n  The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.\n\n\n\n\nOthers May Praise What They Like\n\n  Others may praise what they like;\n  But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing in art\n      or aught else,\n  Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river, also the\n      western prairie-scent,\n  And exudes it all again.\n\n\n\n\nWho Learns My Lesson Complete?\n\n  Who learns my lesson complete?\n  Boss, journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist,\n  The stupid and the wise thinker, parents and offspring, merchant,\n      clerk, porter and customer,\n  Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy--draw nigh and commence;\n  It is no lesson--it lets down the bars to a good lesson,\n  And that to another, and every one to another still.\n\n  The great laws take and effuse without argument,\n  I am of the same style, for I am their friend,\n  I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams.\n\n  I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons\n      of things,\n  They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.\n\n  I cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself--\n      it is very wonderful.\n\n  It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so\n      exactly in its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt or\n      the untruth of a single second,\n  I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years,\n      nor ten billions of years,\n  Nor plann'd and built one thing after another as an architect plans\n      and builds a house.\n\n  I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,\n  Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,\n  Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.\n\n  Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal;\n  I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and\n      how I was conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful,\n  And pass'd from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of\n      summers and winters to articulate and walk--all this is\n      equally wonderful.\n\n  And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other\n      without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see\n      each other, is every bit as wonderful.\n\n  And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,\n  And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to\n      be true, is just as wonderful.\n\n  And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is\n      equally wonderful,\n  And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally\n      wonderful.\n\n\n\n\nTests\n\n  All submit to them where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to\n      analysis in the soul,\n  Not traditions, not the outer authorities are the judges,\n  They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions,\n  They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves,\n      and touches themselves;\n  For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far\n      and near without one exception.\n\n\n\n\nThe Torch\n\n  On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen's group\n      stands watching,\n  Out on the lake that expands before them, others are spearing salmon,\n  The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,\n  Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow.\n\n\n\n\nO Star of France [1870-71]\n\n  O star of France,\n  The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,\n  Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,\n  Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,\n  And 'mid its teeming madden'd half-drown'd crowds,\n  Nor helm nor helmsman.\n\n  Dim smitten star,\n  Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes,\n  The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,\n  Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast's dreams of brotherhood,\n  Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.\n\n  Star crucified--by traitors sold,\n  Star panting o'er a land of death, heroic land,\n  Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.\n\n  Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee,\n  Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,\n  And left thee sacred.\n\n  In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,\n  In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,\n  In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,\n  In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones\n      that shamed thee,\n  In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,\n  This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,\n  The spear thrust in thy side.\n\n  O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!\n  Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!\n\n  Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,\n  Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,\n  Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,\n  Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,\n  Onward beneath the sun following its course,\n  So thee O ship of France!\n\n  Finish'd the days, the clouds dispel'd\n  The travail o'er, the long-sought extrication,\n  When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,\n  (In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours\n      Columbia,)\n  Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,\n  In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,\n  Shall beam immortal.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ox-Tamer\n\n  In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region,\n  Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous tamer of oxen,\n  There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to\n      break them,\n  He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him,\n  He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock\n      chafes up and down the yard,\n  The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,\n  Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this tamer tames him;\n  See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old,\n      and he is the man who has tamed them,\n  They all know him, all are affectionate to him;\n  See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;\n  Some are buff-color'd, some mottled, one has a white line running\n      along his back, some are brindled,\n  Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--see you! the bright hides,\n  See, the two with stars on their foreheads--see, the round bodies\n      and broad backs,\n  How straight and square they stand on their legs--what fine sagacious eyes!\n  How straight they watch their tamer--they wish him near them--how\n      they turn to look after him!\n  What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them;\n  Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,\n      poems, depart--all else departs,)\n  I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend,\n  Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,\n  In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.\n\n\n\n\nAn Old Man's Thought of School\n  [For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, 1874]\n\n  An old man's thought of school,\n  An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot.\n\n  Now only do I know you,\n  O fair auroral skies--O morning dew upon the grass!\n\n  And these I see, these sparkling eyes,\n  These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives,\n  Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, immortal ships,\n  Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,\n  On the soul's voyage.\n\n  Only a lot of boys and girls?\n  Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?\n  Only a public school?\n\n  Ah more, infinitely more;\n  (As George Fox rais'd his warning cry, \"Is it this pile of brick and\n      mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the church?\n  Why this is not the church at all--the church is living, ever living\n      souls.\")\n\n  And you America,\n  Cast you the real reckoning for your present?\n  The lights and shadows of your future, good or evil?\n  To girlhood, boyhood look, the teacher and the school.\n\n\n\n\nWandering at Morn\n\n  Wandering at morn,\n  Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts, thee in my thoughts,\n  Yearning for thee harmonious Union! thee, singing bird divine!\n  Thee coil'd in evil times my country, with craft and black dismay,\n      with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee,\n  This common marvel I beheld--the parent thrush I watch'd feeding its young,\n  The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic,\n  Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.\n\n  There ponder'd, felt I,\n  If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be turn'd,\n  If vermin so transposed, so used and bless'd may be,\n  Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;\n  Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you?\n  From these your future song may rise with joyous trills,\n  Destin'd to fill the world.\n\n\n\n\nItalian Music in Dakota\n  [\"The Seventeenth--the finest Regimental Band I ever heard.\"]\n\n  Through the soft evening air enwinding all,\n  Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,\n  In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,\n  Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,\n  (Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,\n  Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,\n  Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the opera house,\n  Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,\n  Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's anguish,\n  And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)\n  Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,\n  Music, Italian music in Dakota.\n\n  While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,\n  Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,\n  Acknowledging rapport however far remov'd,\n  (As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,)\n  Listens well pleas'd.\n\n\n\n\nWith All Thy Gifts\n\n  With all thy gifts America,\n  Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world,\n  Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee--with these and like of\n      these vouchsafed to thee,\n  What if one gift thou lackest? (the ultimate human problem never solving,)\n  The gift of perfect women fit for thee--what if that gift of gifts\n      thou lackest?\n  The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, completion, fit for thee?\n  The mothers fit for thee?\n\n\n\n\nMy Picture-Gallery\n\n  In a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix'd house,\n  It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other;\n  Yet behold, it has room for all the shows of the world, all memories!\n  Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;\n  Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself,\n  With finger rais'd he points to the prodigal pictures.\n\n\n\n\nThe Prairie States\n\n  A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude,\n  Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,\n  With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,\n  By all the world contributed--freedom's and law's and thrift's society,\n  The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,\n  To justify the past.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXV\n\n\nProud Music of the Storm\n\n       1\n  Proud music of the storm,\n  Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,\n  Strong hum of forest tree-tops--wind of the mountains,\n  Personified dim shapes--you hidden orchestras,\n  You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,\n  Blending with Nature's rhythmus all the tongues of nations;\n  You chords left as by vast composers--you choruses,\n  You formless, free, religious dances--you from the Orient,\n  You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,\n  You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,\n  Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls,\n  Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless,\n  Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you seiz'd me?\n\n\n      2\n  Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,\n  Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,\n  Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,\n  For thee they sing and dance O soul.\n\n  A festival song,\n  The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriage-march,\n  With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill'd to the brim with love,\n  The red-flush'd cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming full of\n      friendly faces young and old,\n  To flutes' clear notes and sounding harps' cantabile.\n\n  Now loud approaching drums,\n  Victoria! seest thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but flying?\n      the rout of the baffled?\n  Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?\n\n  (Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in agony,\n  The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken'd ruins, the embers of cities,\n  The dirge and desolation of mankind.)\n\n  Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me,\n  I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,\n  I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,\n  I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle ages.\n\n  Now the great organ sounds,\n  Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth,\n  On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,\n  All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,\n  Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol and\n      play, the clouds of heaven above,)\n  The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,\n  Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the rest,\n  And with it every instrument in multitudes,\n  The players playing, all the world's musicians,\n  The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,\n  All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,\n  The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,\n  And for their solvent setting earth's own diapason,\n  Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,\n  A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes, ten-fold renewer,\n  As of the far-back days the poets tell, the Paradiso,\n  The straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done,\n  The journey done, the journeyman come home,\n  And man and art with Nature fused again.\n\n  Tutti!

feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,\n  Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,\n  Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,\n  Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.\n\n  How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,\n  How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.\n\n  The wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the\n      livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,\n  The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their\n      strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging\n      from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,\n  The night pervades them and infolds them.\n\n  The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on\n      the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,\n  The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,\n  The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,\n  And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.\n\n  The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,\n  The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,\n  The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?\n  And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?\n\n  The female that loves unrequited sleeps,\n  And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,\n  The head of the money-maker that

hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,\n  The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.\n\n  Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,\n  The earth recedes from me into the night,\n  I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is\n      beautiful.\n\n  I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers\n      each in turn,\n  I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,\n  And I become the other dreamers.\n\n  I am a dance--play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!\n\n  I am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight,\n  I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way look,\n  Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is\n      neither ground nor sea.\n\n  Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,\n  Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,\n  I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,\n  And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,\n  To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and\n      resume the way;\n  Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting\n      music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!\n\n  I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,\n  The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,\n  He who has been famous and

come, and it is dark.\n\n  Double yourself and receive me darkness,\n  Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.\n\n  I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.\n\n  He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,\n  He rises with me silently from the bed.\n\n  Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,\n  I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.\n\n  My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,\n  I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.\n\n  Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?\n  I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,\n  I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.\n\n       2\n  I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\n  Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.\n\n  It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,\n  I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's\n      stockings.\n\n  It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,\n  I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\n\n  A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,\n  It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is\n      blank here, for reasons.\n\n  (It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,\n  Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)\n\n       3\n  I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies\n      of the sea,\n  His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with\n      courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,\n  I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,\n  I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\n      the rocks.\n\n  What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\n  Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\n      of his middle age?\n\n  Steady and long he struggles,\n  He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength\n      holds out,\n  The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,\n      they roll him, swing him, turn him,\n  His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is\n      continually bruis'd on rocks,\n  Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.\n\n       4\n  I turn but do not extricate myself,\n  Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\n\n  The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,\n  The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\n\n  I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as\n      she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.\n\n  I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\n  I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\n\n  I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us alive,\n  In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\n\n       5\n  Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\n  Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd\n      hills amid a crowd of officers.\n  His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,\n  He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd\n      from his cheeks,\n  He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\n      their parents.\n\n  The same at last and at last when peace is declared,\n  He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers\n      all pass through,\n  The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\n  The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,\n  He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands\n      and bids good-by to the army.\n\n       6\n  Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,\n  Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on\n      the old homestead.\n\n  A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,\n  On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\n  Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd\n      her face,\n  Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\n      she spoke.\n\n  My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\n  She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and\n      pliant limbs,\n  The more she look'd upon her she loved her,\n  Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\n  She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook'd\n      food for her,\n  She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\n\n  The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\n      afternoon she went away,\n  O my mother was loth to have her go away,\n  All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month,\n  She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,\n  But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.\n\n       7\n  A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an\n      amour of the light and air,\n  I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,\n  And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.\n\n  O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,\n  Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his thrift,\n  The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill'd.\n\n  Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,\n  The sailor sails, the exile returns home,\n  The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond months\n      and years,\n  The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with\n      the well known neighbors and faces,\n  They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off,\n  The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage\n      home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,\n  To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,\n  The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the\n      Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,\n  The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.\n\n  The homeward bound and the outward bound,\n  The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuye, the onanist, the female that\n      loves unrequited, the money-maker,\n  The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those\n      waiting to commence,\n  The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee\n      that is chosen and the nominee that has fail'd,\n  The great already known and the great any time after to-day,\n  The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,\n  The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced\n      him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,\n  The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,\n  The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,\n  The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,\n  I swear they are averaged now--one is no better than the other,\n  The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.\n\n  I swear they are all beautiful,\n  Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is\n      beautiful,\n  The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.\n\n  Peace is always beautiful,\n  The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.\n\n  The myth of heaven indicates the soul,\n  The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it\n      comes or it lags behind,\n  It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on itself\n      and encloses the world,\n  Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,and perfect and\n      clean the womb cohering,\n  The head well-grown proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and\n      joints proportion'd and plumb.\n\n  The soul is always beautiful,\n  The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,\n  What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place,\n  The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,\n  The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of\n      the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,\n  The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on\n      in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,\n  The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite--\n      they unite now.\n\n       8\n  The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,\n  They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as\n      they lie unclothed,\n  The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and American\n      are hand in hand,\n  Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand\n      in hand,\n  The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they\n      press close without lust, his lips press her neck,\n  The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with\n      measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with\n      measureless love,\n  The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,\n  The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is\n      inarm'd by friend,\n  The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar,\n      the wrong 'd made right,\n  The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master\n      salutes the slave,\n  The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane, the\n      suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,\n  The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is sound,\n      the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor distress'd\n      head is free,\n  The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother\n      than ever,\n  Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,\n  The swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in condition,\n  They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the\n      night, and awake.\n\n  I too pass from the night,\n  I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you.\n\n  Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?\n  I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,\n  I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,\n  I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but\n      I know I came well and shall go well.\n\n  I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,\n  I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.\n\n\n\n\nTranspositions\n\n  Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever\n      bawling--let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands;\n  Let judges and criminals be transposed--let the prison-keepers be\n      put in prison--let those that were prisoners take the keys;\n  Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIX\n\n\nTo Think of Time\n\n      1\n  To think of time--of all that retrospection,\n  To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward.\n\n  Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?\n  Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?\n  Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?\n\n  Is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?\n  If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.\n\n  To think that the sun rose in the east--that men and women were\n      flexible, real, alive--that every thing was alive,\n  To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part,\n  To think that we are now here and bear our part.\n\n       2\n  Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an accouchement,\n  Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse.\n\n  The dull nights go over and the dull days also,\n  The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,\n  The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible\n      look for an answer,\n  The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters\n      are sent for,\n  Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has long\n      pervaded the rooms,)\n  The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,\n  The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,\n  The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,\n  The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,\n  It is palpable as the living are palpable.\n\n  The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,\n  But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously\n      on the corpse.\n\n       3\n  To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials,\n  To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking\n      great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them.\n\n  To think how eager we are in building our houses,\n  To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent.\n\n  (I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or\n      seventy or eighty years at most,\n  I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)\n\n  Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never\n      cease--they are the burial lines,\n  He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall\n      surely be buried.\n\n\n      4\n  A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,\n  A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,\n  Each after his kind.\n\n  Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river,\n      half-frozen mud in the streets,\n  A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of December,\n  A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver,\n      the cortege mostly drivers.\n\n  Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell,\n  The gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living\n      alight, the hearse uncloses,\n  The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on\n      the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,\n  The mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,\n  A minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,\n  He is decently put away--is there any thing more?\n\n  He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,\n  Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate\n      hearty, drank hearty,\n  Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward the\n      last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution,\n  Died, aged forty-one years--and that was his funeral.\n\n  Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap,\n      wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,\n  Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you\n      loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind,\n  Good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out,\n      last out, turning-in at night,\n  To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers, and he\n      there takes no interest in them.\n\n       5\n  The markets, the government, the working-man's wages, to think what\n      account they are through our nights and days,\n  To think that other working-men will make just as great account of\n      them, yet we make little or no account.\n\n  The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what you call\n      goodness, to think how wide a difference,\n  To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie\n      beyond the difference.\n\n  To think how much pleasure there is,\n  Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or\n      planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?\n  Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the\n      beautiful maternal cares?\n  These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,\n  But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.\n\n  Your farm, profits, crops--to think how engross'd you are,\n  To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of\n      what avail?\n\n       6\n  What will be will be well, for what is is well,\n  To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.\n\n  The domestic joys, the dally housework or business, the building of\n      houses, are not phantasms, they have weight, form, location,\n  Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them\n      phantasms,\n  The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,\n  The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of his\n      life are well-consider'd.\n\n  You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely\n      around yourself,\n  Yourself! yourself!. yourself, for ever and ever!\n\n       7\n  It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and\n      father, it is to identify you,\n  It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided,\n  Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,\n  You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.\n\n  The threads that were spun are gather'd, the wet crosses the warp,\n      the pattern is systematic.\n\n  The preparations have every one been justified,\n  The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton\n      has given the signal.\n\n  The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,\n  He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of those\n      that to look upon and be with is enough.\n\n  The law of the past cannot be eluded,\n  The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,\n  The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,\n  The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,\n  The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,\n  The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota thereof\n      can be eluded.\n\n       8\n  Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,\n  Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and they on the\n      Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,\n  And they between, and all through the Mississippi country, and all\n      over the earth.\n\n  The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes and\n      good-doers are well,\n  The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and\n      distinguish'd may be well,\n  But there is more account than that, there is strict account of all.\n\n  The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,\n  The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,\n  The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go.\n\n  Of and in all these things,\n  I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of\n      us changed,\n  I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present\n      and past law,\n  And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and\n      past law,\n  For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.\n\n  And I have dream'd that the purpose and essence of the known life,\n      the transient,\n  Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the permanent.\n\n  If all came but to ashes of dung,\n  If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd,\n  Then indeed suspicion of death.\n\n  Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die now,\n  Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?\n\n  Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,\n  Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,\n  The whole universe indicates that it is good,\n  The past and the present indicate that it is good.\n\n  How beautiful and perfect are the animals!\n  How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!\n  What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,\n  The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable\n      fluids perfect;\n  Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely\n      they yet pass on.\n\n       9\n  I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul!\n  The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the\n      animals!\n\n  I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!\n  That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for\n      it, and the cohering is for it!\n  And all preparation is for it--and identity is for it--and life and\n      materials are altogether for it!\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXX.  WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH\n\n\nDarest Thou Now O Soul\n\n  Darest thou now O soul,\n  Walk out with me toward the unknown region,\n  Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow?\n\n  No map there, nor guide,\n  Nor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,\n  Nor face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in that land.\n\n  I know it not O soul,\n  Nor dost thou, all is a blank before us,\n  All waits undream'd of in that region, that inaccessible land.\n\n  Till when the ties loosen,\n  All but the ties eternal, Time and Space,\n  Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us.\n\n  Then we burst forth, we float,\n  In Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,\n  Equal, equipt at last, (O joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O soul.\n\n\n\n\nWhispers of Heavenly Death\n\n  Whispers of heavenly death murmur'd I hear,\n  Labial gossip of night, sibilant chorals,\n  Footsteps gently ascending, mystical breezes wafted soft and low,\n  Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current flowing, forever flowing,\n  (Or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human tears?)\n\n  I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,\n  Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,\n  With at times a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off star,\n  Appearing and disappearing.\n\n  (Some parturition rather, some solemn immortal birth;\n  On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,\n  Some soul is passing over.)\n\n\n\n\nChanting the Square Deific\n\n       1\n  Chanting the square deific, out of the One advancing, out of the sides,\n  Out of the old and new, out of the square entirely divine,\n  Solid, four-sided, (all the sides needed,) from this side Jehovah am I,\n  Old Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;\n  Not Time affects me--I am Time, old, modern as any,\n  Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments,\n  As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,\n  Aged beyond computation, yet never new, ever with those mighty laws rolling,\n  Relentless I forgive no man--whoever sins dies--I will have that man's life;\n  Therefore let none expect mercy--have the seasons, gravitation, the\n      appointed days, mercy? no more have I,\n  But as the seasons and gravitation, and as all the appointed days\n      that forgive not,\n  I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse.\n\n       2\n  Consolator most mild, the promis'd one advancing,\n  With gentle hand extended, the mightier God am I,\n  Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems,\n  From this side, lo! the Lord Christ gazes--lo! Hermes I--lo! mine is\n      Hercules' face,\n  All sorrow, labor, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself,\n  Many times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and\n      crucified, and many times shall be again,\n  All the world have I given up for my dear brothers' and sisters'\n      sake, for the soul's sake,\n  Wanding my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with the kiss\n      of affection,\n  For I am affection, I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope and\n      all-enclosing charity,\n  With indulgent words as to children, with fresh and sane words, mine only,\n  Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin'd myself to an\n      early death;\n  But my charity has no death--my wisdom dies not, neither early nor late,\n  And my sweet love bequeath'd here and elsewhere never dies.\n\n       3\n  Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,\n  Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,\n  Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,\n  With sudra face and worn brow, black, but in the depths of my heart,\n      proud as any,\n  Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me,\n  Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,\n  (Though it was thought I was baffled, and dispel'd, and my wiles\n      done, but that will never be,)\n  Defiant, I, Satan, still live, still utter words, in new lands duly\n      appearing, (and old ones also,)\n  Permanent here from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,\n  Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words.\n\n       4\n  Santa Spirita, breather, life,\n  Beyond the light, lighter than light,\n  Beyond the flames of hell, joyous, leaping easily above hell,\n  Beyond Paradise, perfumed solely with mine own perfume,\n  Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including\n      Saviour and Satan,\n  Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what were God?)\n  Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,\n      (namely the unseen,)\n  Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the\n      general soul,\n  Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,\n  Breathe my breath also through these songs.\n\n\n\n\nOf Him I Love Day and Night\n\n  Of him I love day and night I dream'd I heard he was dead,\n  And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love, but he was\n      not in that place,\n  And I dream'd I wander'd searching among burial-places to find him,\n  And I found that every place was a burial-place;\n  The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now,)\n  The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,\n      Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead as\n      of the living,\n  And fuller, O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living;\n  And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,\n  And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd,\n  And now I am willing to disregard burial-places and dispense with them,\n  And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere,\n      even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied,\n  And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly\n      render'd to powder and pour'd in the sea, I shall be satisfied,\n  Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nYet, Yet, Ye Downcast Hours\n\n  Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also,\n  Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles,\n  Earth to a chamber of mourning turns--I hear the o'erweening, mocking\n      voice,\n  Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward.\n\n  Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,\n  The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,\n  The sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,\n  Come tell me where I am speeding, tell me my destination.\n\n  I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,\n  I approach, hear, behold, the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,\n      your mute inquiry,\n  Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me,--\n  Old age, alarm'd, uncertain--a young woman's voice, appealing to\n      me for comfort;\n  A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?\n\n\n\n\nAs If a Phantom Caress'd Me\n\n  As if a phantom caress'd me,\n  I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore;\n  But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore, the\n      one I loved that caress'd me,\n  As I lean and look through the glimmering light, that one has\n      utterly disappear'd.\n  And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me.\n\n\n\n\nAssurances\n\n  I need no assurances, I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul;\n  I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and\n      face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not cognizant\n      of, calm and actual faces,\n  I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in\n      any iota of the world,\n  I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless,\n      in vain I try to think how limitless,\n  I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their\n      swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one day\n      be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,\n  I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years,\n  I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have\n      their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and\n      the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice,\n  I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are\n      provided for, and that the deaths of young women and the\n      deaths of little children are provided for,\n  (Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the purport\n      of all Life, is not well provided for?)\n  I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of\n      them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has\n      gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,\n  I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any\n      time, is provided for in the inherences of things,\n  I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I\n      believe Heavenly Death provides for all.\n\n\n\n\nQuicksand Years\n\n  Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither,\n  Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,\n  Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess'd soul, eludes not,\n  One's-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that\n      out of all is sure,\n  Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at last finally remains?\n  When shows break up what but One's-Self is sure?\n\n\n\n\nThat Music Always Round Me\n\n  That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long\n      untaught I did not hear,\n  But now the chorus I hear and am elated,\n  A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes of\n      daybreak I hear,\n  A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves,\n  A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe,\n  The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and\n      violins, all these I fill myself with,\n  I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the exquisite\n      meanings,\n  I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving,\n      contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;\n  I do not think the performers know themselves--but now I think\n      begin to know them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Ship Puzzled at Sea\n\n  What ship puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?\n  Or coming in, to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect\n      pilot needs?\n  Here, sailor! here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,\n  Whom, in a little boat, putting off and rowing, I hailing you offer.\n\n\n\n\nA Noiseless Patient Spider\n\n  A noiseless patient spider,\n  I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\n  Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\n  It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament out of itself,\n  Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\n  And you O my soul where you stand,\n  Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\n  Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to\n      connect them,\n  Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold,\n  Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\n\n\n\nO Living Always, Always Dying\n\n  O living always, always dying!\n  O the burials of me past and present,\n  O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever;\n  O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)\n  O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and\n      look at where I cast them,\n  To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind.\n\n\n\n\nTo One Shortly to Die\n\n  From all the rest I single out you, having a message for you,\n  You are to die--let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,\n  I am exact and merciless, but I love you--there is no escape for you.\n\n  Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you 'ust feel it,\n  I do not argue, I bend my head close and half envelop it,\n  I sit quietly by, I remain faithful,\n  I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,\n  I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily, that is\n      eternal, you yourself will surely escape,\n  The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.\n\n  The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions,\n  Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile,\n  You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,\n  You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping friends,\n      I am with you,\n  I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated,\n  I do not commiserate, I congratulate you.\n\n\n\n\nNight on the Prairies\n\n  Night on the prairies,\n  The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,\n  The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;\n  I walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now\n      never realized before.\n\n  Now I absorb immortality and peace,\n  I admire death and test propositions.\n\n  How plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!\n  The same old man and soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content.\n\n  I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited,\n  I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless\n      around me myriads of other globes.\n\n  Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will\n      measure myself by them,\n  And now touch'd with the lives of other globes arrived as far along\n      as those of the earth,\n  Or waiting to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the earth,\n  I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,\n  Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.\n\n  O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,\n  I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.\n\n\n\n\nThought\n\n  As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is playing,\n  To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of a\n      wreck at sea,\n  Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers and\n      wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,\n  Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,\n  Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder'd\n      off the Northeast coast and going down--of the steamship Arctic\n      going down,\n  Of the veil'd tableau-women gather'd together on deck, pale, heroic,\n      waiting the moment that draws so close--O the moment!\n\n  A huge sob--a few bubbles--the white foam spirting up--and then the\n      women gone,\n  Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on--and I now\n      pondering, Are those women indeed gone?\n  Are souls drown'd and destroy'd so?\n  Is only matter triumphant?\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Invocation\n\n  At the last, tenderly,\n  From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,\n  From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,\n  Let me be wafted.\n\n  Let me glide noiselessly forth;\n  With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,\n  Set ope the doors O soul.\n\n  Tenderly--be not impatient,\n  (Strong is your hold O mortal flesh,\n  Strong is your hold O love.)\n\n\n\n\nAs I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing\n\n  As I watch'd the ploughman ploughing,\n  Or the sower sowing in the fields, or the harvester harvesting,\n  I saw there too, O life and death, your analogies;\n  (Life, life is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.)\n\n\n\n\nPensive and Faltering\n\n  Pensive and faltering,\n  The words the Dead I write,\n  For living are the Dead,\n  (Haply the only living, only real,\n  And I the apparition, I the spectre.)\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXXI\n\n\nThou Mother with Thy Equal Brood\n\n       1\n  Thou Mother with thy equal brood,\n  Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,\n  A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,\n  For thee, the future.\n\n  I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,\n  I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,\n  I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd.\n\n  The paths to the house I seek to make,\n  But leave to those to come the house itself.\n\n  Belief I sing, and preparation;\n  As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,\n  But greater still from what is yet to come,\n  Out of that formula for thee I sing.\n\n       2\n  As a strong bird on pinions free,\n  Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,\n  Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,\n  Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.\n\n  The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,\n  Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,\n  Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor\n      library;\n  But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of\n      an Illinois prairie,\n  With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas\n      uplands, or Florida's glades,\n  Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,\n  With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,\n  And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea-sound,\n  That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.\n\n  And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,\n  Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted\n      for thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,\n  Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou\n      transcendental Union!\n  By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,\n  Thought of man justified, blended with God,\n  Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!\n  Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!\n\n       3\n  Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,\n  To formulate the Modern--out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,\n  Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art,\n  (Recast, may-be discard them, end them--maybe their work is done,\n      who knows?)\n  By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead,\n  To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.\n\n  And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain,\n  Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,\n  Thou carefully prepared by it so long--haply thou but unfoldest it,\n      only maturest it,\n  It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the by-gone time contain'd in thee,\n  Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with\n      reference to thee;\n  Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,\n  The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.\n\n       4\n  Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,\n  Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,\n  The Past is also stored in thee,\n  Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western\n      continent alone,\n  Earth's resume entire floats on thy keel O ship, is steadied by thy spars,\n  With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or\n      swim with thee,\n  With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou\n      bear'st the other continents,\n  Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant;\n  Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou\n      carriest great companions,\n  Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,\n  And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.\n\n       5\n  Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,\n  Like a limitless golden cloud filling the westernr sky,\n  Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,\n  Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,\n  Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing,\n  Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength\n      and life,\n  World of the real--world of the twain in one,\n  World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to\n      identity, body, by it alone,\n  Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious materials,\n  By history's cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither sent,\n  Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be\n      constructed here,\n  (The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, literatures\n      to come,)\n  Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform'd, neither do I define thee,\n  How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?\n  I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,\n  I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past,\n  I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire globe,\n  But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,\n  I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,\n  I merely thee ejaculate!\n\n  Thee in thy future,\n  Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd mind,\n      thy soaring spirit,\n  Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-moving,\n      fructifying all,\n  Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great hilarity,\n  Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd so\n      long upon the mind of man,\n  The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;\n  Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male--thee in thy\n      athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,\n  (To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,\n      endear'd alike, forever equal,)\n  Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but certain,\n  Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, (until which thy proudest\n      material civilization must remain in vain,)\n  Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship--thee in no single\n      bible, saviour, merely,\n  Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant\n      within thyself, equal to any, divine as any,\n  (Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars, nor\n      in thy century's visible growth,\n  But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great Mother!)\n  Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students,\n      born of thee,\n  Thee in thy democratic fetes en-masse, thy high original festivals,\n      operas, lecturers, preachers,\n  Thee in thy ultimate, (the preparations only now completed, the\n      edifice on sure foundations tied,)\n  Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational\n      joys, thy love and godlike aspiration,\n  In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung'd orators, thy\n      sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,\n  These! these in thee, (certain to come,) to-day I prophesy.\n\n       6\n  Land tolerating all, accepting all, not for the good alone, all good\n      for thee,\n  Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself,\n  Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself.\n\n  (Lo, where arise three peerless stars,\n  To be thy natal stars my country, Ensemble, Evolution, Freedom,\n  Set in the sky of Law.)\n\n  Land of unprecedented faith, God's faith,\n  Thy soil, thy very subsoil, all upheav'd,\n  The general inner earth so long so sedulously draped over, now hence\n      for what it is boldly laid bare,\n  Open'd by thee to heaven's light for benefit or bale.\n\n  Not for success alone,\n  Not to fair-sail unintermitted always,\n  The storm shall dash thy face, the murk of war and worse than war\n      shall cover thee all over,\n  (Wert capable of war, its tug and trials? be capable of peace, its trials,\n  For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in prosperous\n      peace, not war;)\n  In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee, thou in\n      disease shalt swelter,\n  The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy\n      breasts, seeking to strike thee deep within,\n  Consumption of the worst, moral consumption, shall rouge thy face\n      with hectic,\n  But thou shalt face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them all,\n  Whatever they are to-day and whatever through time they may be,\n  They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee,\n  While thou, Time's spirals rounding, out of thyself, thyself still\n      extricating, fusing,\n  Equable, natural, mystical Union thou, (the mortal with immortal blent,)\n  Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future, the spirit of the\n      body and the mind,\n  The soul, its destinies.\n\n  The soul, its destinies, the real real,\n  (Purport of all these apparitions of the real;)\n  In thee America, the soul, its destinies,\n  Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous!\n  By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd, (by these thyself solidifying,)\n  Thou mental, moral orb--thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World!\n  The Present holds thee not--for such vast growth as thine,\n  For such unparallel'd flight as thine, such brood as thine,\n  The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee.\n\n\n\n\nA Paumanok Picture\n\n  Two boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still,\n  Ten fishermen waiting--they discover a thick school of mossbonkers\n      --they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,\n  The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course to the\n      beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,\n  The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,\n  Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand\n      ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs,\n  The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,\n  Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the water,\n      the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXXII.  FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT\n\n\nThou Orb Aloft Full-Dazzling\n\n  Thou orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!\n  Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,\n  The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,\n  And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;\n  O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.\n\n  Hear me illustrious!\n  Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,\n  Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge, thy\n      touching-distant beams enough,\n  Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.\n\n  (Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,\n  I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,\n  Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice--and\n      thou O sun,\n  As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of\n      flame gigantic,\n  I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)\n\n  Thou that with fructifying heat and light,\n  O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North and South,\n  O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains,\n      Kanada's woods,\n  O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,\n  Thou that impartially enfoldest all, not only continents, seas,\n  Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally,\n  Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of\n      thy million millions,\n  Strike through these chants.\n\n  Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,\n  Prepare the later afternoon of me myself--prepare my lengthening shadows,\n  Prepare my starry nights.\n\n\n\n\nFaces\n\n       1\n  Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by-road, faces!\n  Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,\n  The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common benevolent face,\n  The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural lawyers\n      and judges broad at the back-top,\n  The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved\n      blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens,\n  The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,\n  The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or\n      despised face,\n  The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of\n      many children,\n  The face of an amour, the face of veneration,\n  The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,\n  The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face,\n  A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper,\n  A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.\n\n  Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces\n      and faces and faces,\n  I see them and complain not, and am content with all.\n\n       2\n  Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their\n      own finale?\n\n  This now is too lamentable a face for a man,\n  Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for it,\n  Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.\n\n  This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage,\n  Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.\n\n  This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,\n  Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.\n\n  This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,\n  And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.\n\n  This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,\n  Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show\n      nothing but their whites,\n  Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn'd-in nails,\n  The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while he\n      speculates well.\n\n  This face is bitten by vermin and worms,\n  And this is some murderer's knife with a half-pull'd scabbard.\n\n  This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,\n  An unceasing death-bell tolls there.\n\n       3\n  Features of my equals would you trick me with your creas'd and\n      cadaverous march?\n  Well, you cannot trick me.\n\n  I see your rounded never-erased flow,\n  I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.\n\n  Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats,\n  You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.\n\n  I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had at\n      the asylum,\n  And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,\n  I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,\n  The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement,\n  And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,\n  And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm'd, every inch\n      as good as myself.\n\n       4\n  The Lord advances, and yet advances,\n  Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd hand bringing up the\n      laggards.\n\n  Out of this face emerge banners and horses--O superb! I see what is coming,\n  I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners clearing the way,\n  I hear victorious drums.\n\n  This face is a life-boat,\n  This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest,\n  This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,\n  This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.\n\n  These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,\n  They show their descent from the Master himself.\n\n  Off the word I have spoken I except not one--red, white, black, are\n      all deific,\n  In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years.\n\n  Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,\n  Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,\n  I read the promise and patiently wait.\n\n  This is a full-grown lily's face,\n  She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets,\n  Come here she blushingly cries, Come nigh to me limber-hipp'd man,\n  Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,\n  Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,\n  Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and shoulders.\n\n       5\n  The old face of the mother of many children,\n  Whist!

SONGS OF PARTING\n\n\nAs the Time Draws Nigh\n\n  As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud,\n  A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me.\n\n  I shall go forth,\n  I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or how long,\n  Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will\n      suddenly cease.\n\n  O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?\n  Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us? --and yet it is\n      enough, O soul;\n  O soul, we have positively appear'd--that is enough.\n\n\n\n\nYears of the Modern\n\n  Years of the modern! years of the unperform'd!\n  Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,\n  I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other nations\n      preparing,\n  I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the solidarity\n      of races,\n  I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's stage,\n  (Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts\n      suitable to them closed?)\n  I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very haughty,\n      with Law on one side and Peace on the other,\n  A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;\n  What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?\n  I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,\n  I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken,\n  I see the landmarks of European kings removed,\n  I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give way;)\n  Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,\n  Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God,\n  Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!\n  His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the\n      Pacific, the archipelagoes,\n  With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the\n      wholesale engines of war,\n  With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all\n      geography, all lands;\n  What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing under\n      the seas?\n  Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?\n  Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim,\n  The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,\n  No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights;\n  Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to\n      pierce it, is full of phantoms,\n  Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,\n  This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams\n      O years!\n  Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not\n      whether I sleep or wake;)\n  The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,\n  The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.\n\n\n\n\nAshes of Soldiers\n\n  Ashes of soldiers South or North,\n  As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,\n  The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,\n  And again the advance of the armies.\n\n  Noiseless as mists and vapors,\n  From their graves in the trenches ascending,\n  From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,\n  From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,\n  In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or\n      single ones they come,\n  And silently gather round me.\n\n  Now sound no note O trumpeters,\n  Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,\n  With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, (ah\n      my brave horsemen!\n  My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,\n  With all the perils were yours.)\n\n  Nor you drummers, neither at reveille at dawn,\n  Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled beat for burial,\n  Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.\n\n  But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade,\n  Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless,\n  The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,\n  I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers.\n\n  Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,\n  Draw close, but speak not.\n\n  Phantoms of countless lost,\n  Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,\n  Follow me ever--desert me not while I live.\n\n  Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living--sweet are the musical\n      voices sounding,\n  But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes.\n\n  Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,\n  But love is not over--and what love, O comrades!\n  Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.\n\n  Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,\n  Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,\n  Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride.\n\n  Perfume all--make all wholesome,\n  Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,\n  O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.\n\n  Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,\n  That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew,\n  For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.\n\n\n\n\nThoughts\n\n       1\n  Of these years I sing,\n  How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as through\n      parturitions,\n  How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure\n      fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people--illustrates\n      evil as well as good,\n  The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's-self,\n  How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,\n      obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,\n  How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or\n      see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,\n  (But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious\n      and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)\n\n  How the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,\n      willful, as I love them,\n  How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the\n      sounding and resounding, keep on and on,\n  How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things ended\n      and things begun,\n  How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of\n      freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and\n      of all that is begun,\n  And how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs\n      and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\n  And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be\n      convuls'd, and serve other parturitions and transitions,\n  And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too,\n      serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors,\n      serves,\n  And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.\n\n       2\n  Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,\n  Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to\n      impregnable and swarming places,\n  Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,\n  Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada,\n      and the rest,\n  (Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)\n  Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for--and of what\n      all sights, North, South, East and West, are,\n  Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the\n      unnamed lost ever present in my mind;\n  Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,\n  Of the present, passing, departing--of the growth of completer men\n      than any yet,\n  Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the\n      Mississippi flows,\n  Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,\n  Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of\n      inalienable homesteads,\n  Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and\n      sweet blood,\n  Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,\n  Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the\n      Anahuacs,\n  Of these songs, well understood there, (being made for that area,)\n  Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there,\n  (O it lurks in me night and day--what is gain after all to savageness\n      and freedom?)\n\n\n\n\nSong at Sunset\n\n  Splendor of ended day floating and filling me,\n  Hour prophetic, hour resuming the past,\n  Inflating my throat, you divine average,\n  You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing.\n\n  Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness,\n  Eyes of my soul seeing perfection,\n  Natural life of me faithfully praising things,\n  Corroborating forever the triumph of things.\n\n  Illustrious every one!\n  Illustrious what we name space, sphere of unnumber'd spirits,\n  Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings, even the tiniest insect,\n  Illustrious the attribute of speech, the senses, the body,\n  Illustrious the passing light--illustrious the pale reflection on\n      the new moon in the western sky,\n  Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch, to the last.\n\n  Good in all,\n  In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,\n  In the annual return of the seasons,\n  In the hilarity of youth,\n  In the strength and flush of manhood,\n  In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,\n  In the superb vistas of death.\n\n  Wonderful to depart!\n  Wonderful to be here!\n  The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood!\n  To breathe the air, how delicious!\n  To speak--to walk--to seize something by the hand!\n  To prepare for sleep, for bed, to look on my rose-color'd flesh!\n  To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large!\n  To be this incredible God I am!\n  To have gone forth among other Gods, these men and women I love.\n\n  Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself\n  How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!\n  How the clouds pass silently overhead!\n  How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and on!\n  How the water sports and sings! (surely it is alive!)\n  How the trees rise and stand up, with strong trunks, with branches\n      and leaves!\n  (Surely there is something more in each of the trees, some living soul.)\n\n  O amazement of things--even the least particle!\n  O spirituality of things!\n  O strain musical flowing through ages and continents, now reaching\n      me and America!\n  I take your strong chords, intersperse them, and cheerfully pass\n      them forward.\n\n  I too carol the sun, usher'd or at noon, or as now, setting,\n  I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the\n      growths of the earth,\n  I too have felt the resistless call of myself.\n\n  As I steam'd down the Mississippi,\n  As I wander'd over the prairies,\n  As I have lived, as I have look'd through my windows my eyes,\n  As I went forth in the morning, as I beheld the light breaking in the east,\n  As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach\n      of the Western Sea,\n  As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago, whatever streets I have roam'd,\n  Or cities or silent woods, or even amid the sights of war,\n  Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph.\n\n  I sing to the last the equalities modern or old,\n  I sing the endless finales of things,\n  I say Nature continues, glory continues,\n  I praise with electric voice,\n  For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,\n  And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe.\n\n  O setting sun! though the time has come,\n  I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated adoration.\n\n\n\n\nAs at Thy Portals Also Death\n\n  As at thy portals also death,\n  Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds,\n  To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, maternity,\n  To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,\n  (I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still,\n  I sit by the form in the coffin,\n  I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks,\n      the closed eyes in the coffin;)\n  To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of earth,\n      life, love, to me the best,\n  I grave a monumental line, before I go, amid these songs,\n  And set a tombstone here.\n\n\n\n\nMy Legacy\n\n  The business man the acquirer vast,\n  After assiduous years surveying results, preparing for departure,\n  Devises houses and lands to his children, bequeaths stocks, goods,\n      funds for a school or hospital,\n  Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens, souvenirs of gems\n      and gold.\n\n  But I, my life surveying, closing,\n  With nothing to show to devise from its idle years,\n  Nor houses nor lands, nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends,\n  Yet certain remembrances of the war for you, and after you,\n  And little souvenirs of camps and soldiers, with my love,\n  I bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs.\n\n\n\n\nPensive on Her Dead Gazing\n\n  Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,\n  Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battlefields gazing,\n  (As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd,)\n  As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd,\n  Absorb them well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose not my\n      sons, lose not an atom,\n  And you streams absorb them well, taking their dear blood,\n  And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable,\n  And all you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers' depths,\n  And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear children's\n      blood trickling redden'd,\n  And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees,\n  My dead absorb or South or North--my young men's bodies absorb,\n      and their precious precious blood,\n  Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a\n      year hence,\n  In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence,\n  In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings, give\n      my immortal heroes,\n  Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me their breath, let not an\n      atom be lost,\n  O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!\n  Exhale them perennial sweet death, years, centuries hence.\n\n\n\n\nCamps of Green\n\n  Nor alone those camps of white, old comrades of the wars,\n  When as order'd forward, after a long march,\n  Footsore and weary, soon as the light lessens we halt for the night,\n  Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack, dropping\n      asleep in our tracks,\n  Others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up begin to sparkle,\n  Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark,\n  And a word provided for countersign, careful for safety,\n  Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums,\n  We rise up refresh'd, the night and sleep pass'd over, and resume our\n      journey,\n  Or proceed to battle.\n\n  Lo, the camps of the tents of green,\n  Which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep filling,\n  With a mystic army, (is it too order'd forward? is it too only\n      halting awhile,\n  Till night and sleep pass over?)\n\n  Now in those camps of green, in their tents dotting the world,\n  In the parents, children, husbands, wives, in them, in the old and young,\n  Sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content\n      and silent there at last,\n  Behold the mighty bivouac-field and waiting-camp of all,\n  Of the corps and generals all, and the President over the corps and\n      generals all,\n  And of each of us O soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we fought,\n  (There without hatred we all, all meet.)\n\n  For presently O soldiers, we too camp in our place in the\n      bivouac-camps of green,\n  But we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign,\n  Nor drummer to beat the morning drum.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sobbing of the Bells [Midnight, Sept. 19-20, 1881]\n\n  The sobbing of the bells, the sudden death-news everywhere,\n  The slumberers rouse, the rapport of the People,\n  (Full well they know that message in the darkness,\n  Full well return, respond within their breasts, their brains, the\n      sad reverberations,)\n  The passionate toll and clang--city to city, joining, sounding, passing,\n  Those heart-beats of a Nation in the night.\n\n\n\n\nAs They Draw to a Close\n\n  As they draw to a close,\n  Of what underlies the precedent songs--of my aims in them,\n  Of the seed I have sought to plant in them,\n  Of joy, sweet joy, through many a year, in them,\n  (For them, for them have I lived, in them my work is done,)\n  Of many an aspiration fond, of many a dream and plan;\n  Through Space and Time fused in a chant, and the flowing eternal identity,\n  To Nature encompassing these, encompassing God--to the joyous,\n      electric all,\n  To the sense of Death, and accepting exulting in Death in its turn\n      the same as life,\n  The entrance of man to sing;\n  To compact you, ye parted, diverse lives,\n  To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams,\n  And the winds of the north, and the forests of oak and pine,\n  With you O soul.\n\n\n\n\nJoy, Shipmate, Joy!\n\n  Joy, shipmate, Joy!\n  (Pleas'd to my soul at death I cry,)\n  Our life is closed, our life begins,\n  The long, long anchorage we leave,\n  The ship is clear at last, she leaps!\n  She swiftly courses from the shore,\n  Joy, shipmate, joy.\n\n\n\n\nThe Untold Want\n\n  The untold want by life and land ne'er granted,\n  Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find.\n\n\n\n\nPortals\n\n  What are those of the known but to ascend and enter the Unknown?\n  And what are those of life but for Death?\n\n\n\n\nThese Carols\n\n  These carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see,\n  For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World.\n\n\n\n\nNow Finale to the Shore\n\n  Now finale to the shore,\n  Now land and life finale and farewell,\n  Now Voyager depart, (much, much for thee is yet in store,)\n  Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,\n  Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,\n  Duly again to port and hawser's tie returning;\n  But now obey thy cherish'd secret wish,\n  Embrace thy friends, leave all in order,\n  To port and hawser's tie no more returning,\n  Depart upon thy endless cruise old Sailor.\n\n\n\n\nSo Long!\n\n  To conclude, I announce what comes after me.\n\n  I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all,\n  I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to consummations.\n\n  When America does what was promis'd,\n  When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb persons,\n  When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them,\n  When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,\n  Then to me and mine our due fruition.\n\n  I have press'd through in my own right,\n  I have sung the body and the soul, war and peace have I sung, and\n      the songs of life and death,\n  And the songs of birth, and shown that there are many births.\n\n  I have offer'd my style to every one, I have journey'd with confident step;\n  While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper So long!\n  And take the young woman's hand and the young man's hand for the last time.\n\n  I announce natural persons to arise,\n  I announce justice triumphant,\n  I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,\n  I announce the justification of candor and the justification of pride.\n\n  I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only,\n  I announce the Union more and more compact, indissoluble,\n  I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics\n      of the earth insignificant.\n\n  I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, unloosen'd,\n  I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.\n\n  I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the one, (So long!)\n  I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste,\n      affectionate, compassionate, fully arm'd.\n\n  I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,\n  I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation.\n\n  I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-blooded,\n  I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.\n\n  O thicker and faster--(So long!)\n  O crowding too close upon me,\n  I foresee too much, it means more than I thought,\n  It appears to me I am dying.\n\n  Hasten

At a time when few people on this side of the Atlantic\nhad looked into the book, and still fewer had found in it anything save\nmatter for ridicule, you had appraised it, and seen that its value was real\nand great. A true poet and a strong thinker like yourself was indeed likely\nto see that. I read the book eagerly, and perceived that its substantiality\nand power were still ahead of any eulogium with which it might have come\ncommended to me--and, in fact, ahead of most attempts that could be made at\nverbal definition of them.\n\nSome years afterwards, getting to know our friend Swinburne, I found with\nmuch satisfaction that he also was an ardent (not of course a _blind_)\nadmirer of Whitman. Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his\nintense sense of poetic refinement of form in his own works and his\nexacting acuteness as a critic might have seemed likely to carry him away\nfrom Whitman in sympathy at least, if not in actual latitude of perception.\nThose who find the American poet \"utterly formless,\" \"intolerably rough and\nfloundering,\" \"destitute of the A B C of art,\" and the like, might not\nunprofitably ponder this very different estimate of him by the author of\n_Atalanta in Calydon_.\n\nMay we hope that now, twelve years after the first appearance of _Leaves of\nGrass_, the English reading public may be prepared for a selection of\nWhitman's poems, and soon hereafter for a complete edition of them? I trust\nthis may prove to be the case. At any rate, it has been a great\ngratification to me to be concerned in the experiment; and this is enhanced\nby my being enabled to associate with it your name, as that of an early and\nwell-qualified appreciator of Whitman, and no less as that of a dear\nfriend.\n\nYours affectionately,\nW.

One of\nthese is the invitation which I have received to edit a selection from\nWhitman's writings; virtually the first sample of his work ever published\nin England, and offering the first tolerably fair chance he has had of\nmaking his way with English readers on his own showing. Hitherto, such\nreaders--except the small percentage of them to whom it has happened to\ncome across the poems in some one of their American editions--have picked\nacquaintance with them only through the medium of newspaper extracts and\ncriticisms, mostly short-sighted, sneering, and depreciatory, and rather\nintercepting than forwarding the candid construction which people might be\nwilling to put upon the poems, alike in their beauties and their\naberrations. Some English critics, no doubt, have been more discerning--as\nW. J. Fox, of old, in the _Dispatch_, the writer of the notice in the\n_Leader_, and of late two in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the _London\nReview_;[2] but these have been the exceptions among us, the great majority\nof the reviewers presenting that happy and familiar critical combination--\nscurrility and superciliousness.\n\n[Footnote 1: See _The Chronicle_ for 6th July 1867, article _Walt Whitman's\nPoems_.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Since this Prefatory Notice was written [in 1868], another\neulogistic review of Whitman has appeared--that by Mr. Robert Buchanan, in\nthe _Broadway_.]\n\nAs it was my lot to set down so recently several of the considerations\nwhich seem to me most essential and most obvious in regard to Whitman's\nwritings, I can scarcely now recur to the subject without either repeating\nsomething of what I then said, or else leaving unstated some points of\nprincipal importance. I shall therefore adopt the simplest course--that of\nsummarising the critical remarks in my former article; after which, I shall\nleave without further development (ample as is the amount of development\nmost of them would claim) the particular topics there glanced at, and shall\nproceed to some other phases of the subject.\n\nWhitman republished in 1867 his complete poetical works in one moderate-\nsized volume, consisting of the whole _Leaves of Grass_, with a sort of\nsupplement thereto named _Songs before Parting_,[3] and of the _Drum Taps_,\nwith its _Sequel_. It has been intimated that he does not expect to write\nany more poems, unless it might be in expression of the religious side of\nman's nature. However, one poem on the last American harvest sown and\nreaped by those who had been soldiers in the great war, has already\nappeared since the volume in question, and has been republished in England.\n\n[Footnote 3: In a copy of the book revised by Whitman himself, which we\nhave seen, this title is modified into _Songs of Parting_.]\n\nWhitman's poems present no trace of rhyme, save in a couple or so of chance\ninstances. Parts of them, indeed, may be regarded as a warp of prose amid\nthe weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare furnishes the precedent for in\ndrama. Still there is a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense\nthroughout.\n\nLavish and persistent has been the abuse poured forth upon Whitman by his\nown countrymen; the tricklings of the British press give but a moderate\nidea of it. The poet is known to repay scorn with scorn. Emerson can,\nhowever, from the first be claimed as on Whitman's side; nor, it is\nunderstood after some inquiry, has that great thinker since then retreated\nfrom this position in fundamentals, although his admiration may have\nentailed some worry upon him, and reports of his recantation have been\nrife. Of other writers on Whitman's side, expressing themselves with no\nmeasured enthusiasm, one may cite Mr. M. D. Conway; Mr. W. D. O'Connor, who\nwrote a pamphlet named _The Good Grey Poet_; and Mr. John Burroughs, author\nof _Walt Whitman as Poet and Person_, published quite recently in New York.\nHis thorough-paced admirers declare Whitman to be beyond rivalry _the_ poet\nof the epoch; an estimate which, startling as it will sound at the first,\nmay nevertheless be upheld, on the grounds that Whitman is beyond all his\ncompetitors a man of the period, one of audacious personal ascendant,\nincapable of all compromise, and an initiator in the scheme and form of his\nworks.\n\nCertain faults are charged against him, and, as far as they are true, shall\nfrankly stand confessed--some of them as very serious faults. Firstly, he\nspeaks on occasion of gross things in gross, crude, and plain terms.\nSecondly, he uses some words absurd or ill-constructed, others which\nproduce a jarring effect in poetry, or indeed in any lofty literature.\nThirdly, he sins from time to time by being obscure, fragmentary, and\nagglomerative--giving long strings of successive and detached items, not,\nhowever, devoid of a certain primitive effectiveness. Fourthly, his self-\nassertion is boundless; yet not always to be understood as strictly or\nmerely personal to himself, but sometimes as vicarious, the poet speaking\non behalf of all men, and every man and woman. These and any other faults\nappear most harshly on a cursory reading; Whitman is a poet who bears and\nneeds to be read as a whole, and then the volume and torrent of his power\ncarry the disfigurements along with it, and away.\n\nThe subject-matter of Whitman's poems, taken individually, is absolutely\nmiscellaneous: he touches upon any and every subject. But he has prefixed\nto his last edition an \"Inscription\" in the following terms, showing that\nthe key-words of the whole book are two--\"One's-self\" and \"En Masse:\"--\n\nSmall is the theme of the following chant, yet the greatest.--namely,\nONE'S-SELF; that wondrous thing, a simple separate person. That, for the\nuse of the New World, I sing. Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I\nsing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse: I say\nthe form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male I sing.\nNor cease at the theme of One's-self. I speak the word of the modern, the\nword EN MASSE. My days I sing, and the lands--with interstice I knew of\nhapless war. O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to\ncommence, I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I\nreturn. And thus upon our journey linked together let us go.\n\nThe book, then, taken as a whole, is the poem both of Personality and of\nDemocracy; and, it may be added, of American nationalism. It is _par\nexcellence_ the modern poem. It is distinguished also by this peculiarity--\nthat in it the most literal view of things is continually merging into the\nmost rhapsodic or passionately abstract. Picturesqueness it has, but mostly\nof a somewhat patriarchal kind, not deriving from the \"word-painting\" of\nthe _littérateur_; a certain echo of the old Hebrew poetry may even be\ncaught in it, extra-modern though it is. Another most prominent and\npervading quality of the book is the exuberant physique of the author. The\nconceptions are throughout those of a man in robust health, and might alter\nmuch under different conditions.\n\nFurther, there is a strong tone of paradox in Whitman's writings. He is\nboth a realist and an optimist in extreme measure: he contemplates evil as\nin some sense not existing, or, if existing, then as being of as much\nimportance as anything else. Not that he is a materialist; on the contrary,\nhe is a most strenuous assertor of the soul, and, with the soul, of the\nbody as its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of\nthings. Neither does he drift into fatalism or indifferentism; the energy\nof his temperament, and ever-fresh sympathy with national and other\ndevelopments, being an effectual bar to this. The paradoxical element of\nthe poems is such that one may sometimes find them in conflict with what\nhas preceded, and would not be much surprised if they said at any moment\nthe reverse of whatever they do say. This is mainly due to the multiplicity\nof the aspects of things, and to the immense width of relation in which\nWhitman stands to all sorts and all aspects of them.\n\nBut the greatest of this poet's distinctions is his absolute and entire\noriginality. He may be termed formless by those who, not without much\nreason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms and\nratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the\ncanon till it includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw\nit close and exclude him. His work is practically certain to stand as\narchetypal for many future poetic efforts--so great is his power as an\noriginator, so fervid his initiative. It forms incomparably the _largest_\nperformance of our period in poetry. Victor Hugo's _Légende des Siècles_\nalone might be named with it for largeness, and even that with much less of\na new starting-point in conception and treatment. Whitman breaks with all\nprecedent. To what he himself perceives and knows he has a personal\nrelation of the intensest kind: to anything in the way of prescription, no\nrelation at all. But he is saved from isolation by the depth of his\nAmericanism; with the movement of his predominant nation he is moved. His\ncomprehension, energy, and tenderness are all extreme, and all inspired by\nactualities. And, as for poetic genius, those who, without being ready to\nconcede that faculty to Whitman, confess his iconoclastic boldness and his\nTitanic power of temperament, working in the sphere of poetry, do in effect\nconfess his genius as well.\n\nSuch, still further condensed, was the critical summary which I gave of\nWhitman's position among poets. It remains to say something a little more\nprecise of the particular qualities of his works. And first, not to slur\nover defects, I shall extract some sentences from a letter which a friend,\nmost highly entitled to form and express an opinion on any poetic\nquestion--one, too, who abundantly upholds the greatness of Whitman as a\npoet--has addressed to me with regard to the criticism above condensed. His\nobservations, though severe on this individual point, appear to me not\nother than correct. \"I don't think that you quite put strength enough into\nyour blame on one side, while you make at least enough of minor faults or\neccentricities. To me it seems always that Whitman's great flaw is a fault\nof debility, not an excess of strength--I mean his bluster. His own\npersonal and national self-reliance and arrogance, I need not tell you, I\napplaud, and sympathise and rejoice in; but the blatant ebullience of\nfeeling and speech, at times, is feeble for so great a poet of so great a\npeople. He is in part certainly the poet of democracy; but not wholly,\n_because_ he tries so openly to be, and asserts so violently that he is--\nalways as if he was fighting the case out on a platform. This is the only\nthing I really or greatly dislike or revolt from. On the whole\" (adds my\ncorrespondent), \"my admiration and enjoyment of his greatness grow keener\nand warmer every time I think of him\"--a feeling, I may be permitted to\nobserve, which is fully shared by myself, and, I suppose, by all who\nconsent in any adequate measure to recognise Whitman, and to yield\nthemselves to his influence.\n\nTo continue. Besides originality and daring, which have been already\ninsisted upon, width and intensity are leading characteristics of his\nwritings--width both of subject-matter and of comprehension, intensity of\nself-absorption into what the poet contemplates and expresses. He scans and\npresents an enormous panorama, unrolled before him as from a mountain-top;\nand yet, whatever most large or most minute or casual thing his eye glances\nupon, that he enters into with a depth of affection which identifies him\nwith it for a time, be the object what it may. There is a singular\ninterchange also of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While\nhe sees men, with even abnormal exactness and sympathy, as men, he sees\nthem also \"as trees walking,\" and admits us to perceive that the whole show\nis in a measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and\nprofounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations\nand auguries. He is the poet indeed of literality, but of passionate and\nsignificant literality, full of indirections as well as directness, and of\nreadings between the lines. If he is the 'cutest of Yankees, he is also as\ntruly an enthusiast as any the most typical poet. All his faculties and\nperformance glow into a white heat of brotherliness; and there is a\n_poignancy_ both of tenderness and of beauty about his finer works which\ndiscriminates them quite as much as their modernness, audacity, or any\nother exceptional point. If the reader wishes to see the great and more\nintimate powers of Whitman in their fullest expression, he may consult the\n_Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln_; than which it would be difficult to\nfind anywhere a purer, more elevated, more poetic, more ideally abstract,\nor at the same time more pathetically personal, threnody--uniting the\nthrilling chords of grief, of beauty, of triumph, and of final unfathomed\nsatisfaction. With all his singularities, Whitman is a master of words and\nof sounds: he has them at his command--made for, and instinct with, his\npurpose--messengers of unsurpassable sympathy and intelligence between\nhimself and his readers. The entire book may be called the paean of the\nnatural man--not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively\nintellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and\nforemost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect.\n\nThere is a singular and impressive intuition or revelation of Swedenborg's:\nthat the whole of heaven is in the form of one man, and the separate\nsocieties of heaven in the forms of the several parts of man. In a large\nsense, the general drift of Whitman's writings, even down to the passages\nwhich read as most bluntly physical, bear a striking correspondence or\nanalogy to this dogma. He takes man, and every organism and faculty of man,\nas the unit--the datum--from which all that we know, discern, and\nspeculate, of abstract and supersensual, as well as of concrete and\nsensual, has to be computed. He knows of nothing nobler than that unit man;\nbut, knowing that, he can use it for any multiple, and for any dynamical\nextension or recast.\n\nLet us next obtain some idea of what this most remarkable poet--the founder\nof _American_ poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic\nvoice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy--is in his\nproper life and person.\n\nWalt Whitman was born at the farm-village of West Hills, Long Island, in\nthe State of New York, and about thirty miles distant from the capital, on\nthe 31st of May 1819. His father's family, English by origin, had already\nbeen settled in this locality for five generations. His mother, named\nLouisa van Velsor, was of Dutch extraction, and came from Cold Spring,\nQueen's County, about three miles from West Hills. \"A fine-looking old\nlady\" she has been termed in her advanced age. A large family ensued from\nthe marriage. The father was a farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and\nbuilder; both parents adhered in religion to \"the great Quaker iconoclast,\nElias Hicks.\" Walt was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and\nbegan life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on as a\ncountry teacher, and then as a miscellaneous press-writer in New York. From\n1837 to 1848 he had, as Mr. Burroughs too promiscuously expresses it,\n\"sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and\nabandonments.\" In 1849 he began travelling, and became at New Orleans a\nnewspaper editor, and at Brooklyn, two years afterwards, a printer. He next\nfollowed his father's business of carpenter and builder. In 1862, after the\nbreaking-out of the great Civil War, in which his enthusiastic unionism and\nalso his anti-slavery feelings attached him inseparably though not\nrancorously to the good cause of the North, he undertook the nursing of the\nsick and wounded in the field, writing also a correspondence in the _New\nYork Times_. I am informed that it was through Emerson's intervention that\nhe obtained the sanction of President Lincoln for this purpose of charity,\nwith authority to draw the ordinary army rations; Whitman stipulating at\nthe same time that he would not receive any remuneration for his services.\nThe first immediate occasion of his going down to camp was on behalf of his\nbrother, Lieutenant-Colonel George W. Whitman, of the 51st New York\nVeterans, who had been struck in the face by a piece of shell at\nFredericksburg. From the spring of 1863 this nursing, both in the field and\nmore especially in hospital at Washington, became his \"one daily and\nnightly occupation;\" and the strongest testimony is borne to his\nmeasureless self-devotion and kindliness in the work, and to the unbounded\nfascination, a kind of magnetic attraction and ascendency, which he\nexercised over the patients, often with the happiest sanitary results.\nNortherner or Southerner, the belligerents received the same tending from\nhim. It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to\nupwards of 100,000 sick and wounded. In a Washington hospital he caught, in\nthe summer of 1864, the first illness he had ever known, caused by poison\nabsorbed into the system in attending some of the worst cases of gangrene.\nIt disabled him for six months. He returned to the hospitals towards the\nbeginning of 1865, and obtained also a clerkship in the Department of the\nInterior. It should be added that, though he never actually joined the army\nas a combatant, he made a point of putting down his name on the enrolment-\nlists for the draft, to take his chance as it might happen for serving the\ncountry in arms. The reward of his devotedness came at the end of June\n1865, in the form of dismissal from his clerkship by the minister, Mr.\nHarlan, who learned that Whitman was the author of the _Leaves of Grass_; a\nbook whose outspokenness, or (as the official chief considered it)\nimmorality, raised a holy horror in the ministerial breast. The poet,\nhowever, soon obtained another modest but creditable post in the office of\nthe Attorney-General. He still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often\non other days as well.\n\nThe portrait of Mr. Whitman reproduced in the present volume is taken from\nan engraving after a daguerreotype given in the original _Leaves of Grass_.\nHe is much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned--a\nmodel of physique and of health, and, by natural consequence, as fully and\nfinely related to all physical facts by his bodily constitution as to all\nmental and spiritual facts by his mind and his consciousness. He is now,\nhowever, old-looking for his years, and might even (according to the\nstatement of one of his enthusiasts, Mr. O'Connor) have passed for being\nbeyond the age for the draft when the war was going on. The same gentleman,\nin confutation of any inferences which might be drawn from the _Leaves of\nGrass_ by a Harlan or other Holy Willie, affirms that \"one more\nirreproachable in his relations to the other sex lives not upon this\nearth\"--an assertion which one must take as one finds it, having neither\nconfirmatory nor traversing evidence at hand. Whitman has light blue eyes,\na florid complexion, a fleecy beard now grey, and a quite peculiar sort of\nmagnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact. His\nordinary appearance is masculine and cheerful: he never shows depression of\nspirits, and is sufficiently undemonstrative, and even somewhat silent in\ncompany. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of\nthe common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and\nartistic impressions--fond of operatic and other good music, and discerning\nin works of art. As to either praise or blame of what he writes, he is\ntotally indifferent, not to say scornful--having in fact a very decisive\nopinion of his own concerning its calibre and destinies. Thoreau, a very\ncongenial spirit, said of Whitman, \"He is Democracy;\" and again, \"After\nall, he suggests something a little more than human.\" Lincoln broke out\ninto the exclamation, \"Well, _he_ looks like a man!\" Whitman responded to\nthe instinctive appreciation of the President, considering him (it is said\nby Mr. Burroughs) \"by far the noblest and purest of the political\ncharacters of the time;\" and, if anything can cast, in the eyes of\nposterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal\nqualities and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written\nmonument reared to him by Whitman.\n\nThe best sketch that I know of Whitman as an accessible human individual is\nthat given by Mr. Conway.[4] I borrow from it the following few details.\n\"Having occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt\nWhitman's book, I was urged by some friends to search him out.... The day\nwas excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly 100°, and the sun blazed\ndown as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze.... I saw stretched\nupon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was\nseeking. With his grey clothing, his blue-grey shirt, his iron-grey hair,\nhis swart sunburnt face and bare neck, he lay upon the brown-and-white\ngrass--for the sun had burnt away its greenness--and was so like the earth\nupon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to\npass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for\nsearching him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot.\n'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was\none of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then\nwalked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room.\nA small room of about fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out\non the barren solitudes of the island; a small cot; a wash-stand with a\nlittle looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall; a pine table\nwith pen, ink, and paper on it; an old line-engraving representing Bacchus,\nhung on the wall, and opposite a similar one of Silenus: these constituted\nthe visible environments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a\nsingle book in the room.... The books he seemed to know and love best were\nthe Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in his\npockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read; one was\nthe top of an omnibus, and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely\nuninhabited, far out in the ocean, called Coney Island.... The only\ndistinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher,\nof Brooklyn, who had visited him.... He confessed to having no talent for\nindustry, and that his forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor,\nbut had discovered that he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread\nand water.... On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I ever see him\nsmile.\"\n\n[Footnote 4: In the _Fortnightly Review_, 15th October 1866.]\n\nThe first trace of Whitman as a writer is in the pages of the _Democratic\nReview_ in or about 1841. Here he wrote some prose tales and sketches--poor\nstuff mostly, so far as I have seen of them, yet not to be wholly\nconfounded with the commonplace. One of them is a tragic school-incident,\nwhich may be surmised to have fallen under his personal observation in his\nearly experience as a teacher. His first poem of any sort was named _Blood\nMoney_, in denunciation of the Fugitive Slave Law, which severed him from\nthe Democratic party. His first considerable work was the _Leaves of\nGrass_. He began it in 1853, and it underwent two or three complete\nrewritings prior to its publication at Brooklyn in 1855, in a quarto\nvolume--peculiar-looking, but with something perceptibly artistic about it.\nThe type of that edition was set up entirely by himself. He was moved to\nundertake this formidable poetic work (as indicated in a private letter of\nWhitman's, from which Mr. Conway has given a sentence or two) by his sense\nof the great materials which America could offer for a really American\npoetry, and by his contempt for the current work of his\ncompatriots--\"either the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at\nbottom nothing but maudlin puerilities or more or less musical verbiage,\narising out of a life of depression and enervation as their result; or else\nthat class of poetry, plays, &c., of which the foundation is feudalism,\nwith its ideas of lords and ladies, its imported standard of gentility, and\nthe manners of European high-life-below-stairs in every line and verse.\"\nThus incited to poetic self-expression, Whitman (adds Mr. Conway) \"wrote on\na sheet of paper, in large letters, these words, 'Make the Work,' and fixed\nit above his table, where he could always see it whilst writing.\nThenceforth every cloud that flitted over him, every distant sail, every\nface and form encountered, wrote a line in his book.\"\n\nThe _Leaves of Grass_ excited no sort of notice until a letter from\nEmerson[5] appeared, expressing a deep sense of its power and magnitude. He\ntermed it \"the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has\nyet contributed.\"\n\n[Footnote 5: Mr. Burroughs (to whom I have recourse for most biographical\nfacts concerning Whitman) is careful to note, in order that no\nmisapprehension may arise on the subject, that, up to the time of his\npublishing the _Leaves of Grass_, the author had not read either the essays\nor the poems of Emerson.]\n\nThe edition of about a thousand copies sold off in less than a year.\nTowards the end of 1856 a second edition in 16mo appeared, printed in New\nYork, also of about a thousand copies. Its chief feature was an additional\npoem beginning \"A Woman waits for me.\" It excited a considerable storm.\nAnother edition, of about four to five thousand copies, duodecimo, came out\nat Boston in 1860-61, including a number of new pieces. The _Drum Taps_,\nconsequent upon the war, with their _Sequel_, which comprises the poem on\nLincoln, followed in 1865; and in 1867, as I have already noted, a complete\nedition of all the poems, including a supplement named _Songs before\nParting_. The first of all the _Leaves of Grass_, in point of date, was the\nlong and powerful composition entitled _Walt Whitman_--perhaps the most\ntypical and memorable of all of his productions, but shut out from the\npresent selection for reasons given further on. The final edition shows\nnumerous and considerable variations from all its precursors; evidencing\nonce again that Whitman is by no means the rough-and-ready writer,\npanoplied in rude art and egotistic self-sufficiency, that many people\nsuppose him to be. Even since this issue, the book has been slightly\nrevised by its author's own hand, with a special view to possible English\ncirculation. The copy so revised has reached me (through the liberal and\nfriendly hands of Mr. Conway) after my selection had already been decided\non; and the few departures from the last printed text which might on\ncomparison be found in the present volume are due to my having had the\nadvantage of following this revised copy. In all other respects I have felt\nbound to reproduce the last edition, without so much as considering whether\nhere and there I might personally prefer the readings of the earlier\nissues.\n\nThe selection here offered to the English reader contains a little less\nthan half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry. My choice has proceeded upon\ntwo simple rules: first, to omit entirely every poem which could with any\ntolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or\npropriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include every\nremaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest. I\nhave also inserted the very remarkable prose preface which Whitman printed\nin the original edition of _Leaves of Grass_, an edition that has become a\nliterary rarity. This preface has not been reproduced in any later\npublication, although its materials have to some extent been worked up into\npoems of a subsequent date.[6] From this prose composition, contrary to\nwhat has been my rule with any of the poems, it has appeared to me\npermissible to omit two or three short phrases which would have shocked\nordinary readers, and the retention of which, had I held it obligatory,\nwould have entailed the exclusion of the preface itself as a whole.\n\n[Footnote 6: Compare, for instance, the Preface, pp. 38, 39, with the poem\n_To a Foiled Revolter or Revoltress_, p. 133.]\n\nA few words must be added as to the indecencies scattered through Whitman's\nwritings. Indecencies or improprieties--or, still better, deforming\ncrudities--they may rightly be termed; to call them immoralities would be\ngoing too far. Whitman finds himself, and other men and women, to be a\ncompound of soul and body; he finds that body plays an extremely prominent\nand determining part in whatever he and other mundane dwellers have\ncognisance of; he perceives this to be the necessary condition of things,\nand therefore, as he fully and openly accepts it, the right condition; and\nhe knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and\nright, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech. That such a\nview of the matter is entitled to a great deal of weight, and at any rate\nto candid consideration and construction, appears to me not to admit of a\ndoubt: neither is it dubious that the contrary view, the only view which a\nmealy-mouthed British nineteenth century admits as endurable, amounts to\nthe condemnation of nearly every great or eminent literary work of past\ntime, whatever the century it belongs to, the country it comes from, the\ndepartment of writing it illustrates, or the degree or sort of merit it\npossesses. Tenth, second, or first century before Christ--first, eighth,\nfourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, or even eighteenth century\nA.D.--it is still the same: no book whose subject-matter admits as possible\nof an impropriety according to current notions can be depended upon to fail\nof containing such impropriety,--can, if those notions are accepted as the\ncanon, be placed with a sense of security in the hands of girls and youths,\nor read aloud to women; and this holds good just as much of severely moral\nor plainly descriptive as of avowedly playful, knowing, or licentious\nbooks. For my part, I am far from thinking that earlier state of\nliterature, and the public feeling from which it sprang, the wrong ones--\nand our present condition the only right one. Equally far, therefore, am I\nfrom indignantly condemning Whitman for every startling allusion or\nexpression which he has admitted into his book, and which I, from motives\nof policy, have excluded from this selection; except, indeed, that I think\nmany of his tabooed passages are extremely raw and ugly on the ground of\npoetic or literary art, whatever aspect they may bear in morals. I have\nbeen rigid in exclusion, because it appears to me highly desirable that a\nfair verdict on Whitman should now be pronounced in England on poetic\ngrounds alone; and because it was clearly impossible that the book, with\nits audacities of topic and of expression included, should run the same\nchance of justice, and of circulation through refined minds and hands,\nwhich may possibly be accorded to it after the rejection of all such\npeccant poems. As already intimated, I have not in a single instance\nexcised any _parts_ of poems: to do so would have been, I conceive, no less\nwrongful towards the illustrious American than repugnant, and indeed\nunendurable, to myself, who aspire to no Bowdlerian honours. The\nconsequence is, that the reader loses _in toto_ several important poems,\nand some extremely fine ones--notably the one previously alluded to, of\nquite exceptional value and excellence, entitled _Walt Whitman_. I\nsacrifice them grudgingly; and yet willingly, because I believe this to be\nthe only thing to do with due regard to the one reasonable object which a\nselection can subserve--that of paving the way towards the issue and\nunprejudiced reception of a complete edition of the poems in England. For\nthe benefit of misconstructionists, let me add in distinct terms that, in\nrespect of morals and propriety, I neither admire nor approve the\nincriminated passages in Whitman's poems, but, on the contrary, consider\nthat most of them would be much better away; and, in respect of art, I\ndoubt whether even one of them deserves to be retained in the exact\nphraseology it at present exhibits. This, however, does not amount to\nsaying that Whitman is a vile man, or a corrupt or corrupting writer; he is\nnone of these.\n\nThe only division of his poems into sections, made by Whitman himself, has\nbeen noted above: _Leaves of Grass_, _Songs before Parting_, supplementary\nto the preceding, and _Drum Taps_, with their _Sequel_. The peculiar title,\n_Leaves of Grass_, has become almost inseparable from the name of Whitman;\nit seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and\nspontaneity of the poems to which it is applied. _Songs before Parting_ may\nindicate that these compositions close Whitman's poetic roll. _Drum Taps_\nare, of course, songs of the Civil War, and their _Sequel_ is mainly on the\nsame theme: the chief poem in this last section being the one on the death\nof Lincoln. These titles all apply to fully arranged series of\ncompositions. The present volume is not in the same sense a fully arranged\nseries, but a selection: and the relation of the poems _inter se_ appears\nto me to depend on altered conditions, which, however narrowed they are, it\nmay be as well frankly to recognise in practice. I have therefore\nredistributed the poems (a latitude of action which I trust the author may\nnot object to), bringing together those whose subject-matter seems to\nwarrant it, however far separated they may possibly be in the original\nvolume. At the same time, I have retained some characteristic terms used by\nWhitman himself, and have named my sections respectively--\n\n    1. Chants Democratic (poems of democracy).\n    2. Drum Taps (war songs).\n    3. Walt Whitman (personal poems).\n    4. Leaves of Grass (unclassified poems).\n    5. Songs of Parting (missives).\n\nThe first three designations explain themselves. The fourth, _Leaves of\nGrass_, is not so specially applicable to the particular poems of that\nsection here as I should have liked it to be; but I could not consent to\ndrop this typical name. The _Songs of Parting_, my fifth section, are\ncompositions in which the poet expresses his own sentiment regarding his\nworks, in which he forecasts their future, or consigns them to the reader's\nconsideration. It deserves mention that, in the copy of Whitman's last\nAmerican edition revised by his own hand, as previously noticed, the series\ntermed _Songs of Parting_ has been recast, and made to consist of poems of\nthe same character as those included in my section No. 5.\n\nComparatively few of Whitman's poems have been endowed by himself with\ntitles properly so called. Most of them are merely headed with the opening\nwords of the poems themselves--as \"I was looking a long while;\" \"To get\nbetimes in Boston Town;\" \"When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed;\" and\nso on. It seems to me that in a selection such a lengthy and circuitous\nmethod of identifying the poems is not desirable: I should wish them to be\nremembered by brief, repeatable, and significant titles. I have therefore\nsupplied titles of my own to such pieces as bear none in the original\nedition: wherever a real title appears in that edition, I have retained it.\n\nWith these remarks I commend to the English reader the ensuing selection\nfrom a writer whom I sincerely believe to be, whatever his faults, of the\norder of _great_ poets, and by no means of pretty good ones. I would urge\nthe reader not to ask himself, and not to return any answer to the\nquestions, whether or not this poet is like other poets--whether or not the\nparticular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the\nworks of those others, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be\ntraced also in Whitman. Let the questions rather be--Is he powerful? Is he\nAmerican? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel and make me feel? I\nentertain no doubt as to the response which in due course of time will be\nreturned to these questions and such as these, in America, in England, and\nelsewhere--or to the further question, \"Is Whitman then indeed a true and a\ngreat poet?\" Lincoln's verdict bespeaks the ultimate decision upon him, in\nhis books as in his habit as he lives--\"Well, _he_ looks like a man.\"\n\nWalt Whitman occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe,\nand one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an\ninfinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and\nprofesses respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and\nprospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one--a\nliterature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured\ndestinies of America: he believes that the Columbus of the continent or the\nWashington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a\nfounder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and\nexpressed more than once in magnificent words--none more so than the lines\nbeginning\n\n\"Come, I will make this continent indissoluble.\"[7]\n\n[Footnote 7: See the poem headed _Love of Comrades_, p. 308.]\n\nWere the idea untrue, it would still be a glorious dream, which a man of\ngenius might be content to live in and die for: but is it untrue? Is it\nnot, on the contrary, true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and\nsubstantial approximation? I believe it _is_ thus true. I believe that\nWhitman is one of the huge, as yet mainly unrecognised, forces of our time;\nprivileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a\nfresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by\ngeneration after generation of believing and ardent--let us hope not\nservile--disciples.\n\n\"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.\" Shelley, who knew\nwhat he was talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and\nwith a profundity of truth Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out\nfor \"legislation\" of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be\npotential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken--that is\nto say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American\nhemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more\ntheir announcer than their inspirer.\n\n1868.\nW. M. ROSSETTI.\n\n_N.B._--The above prefatory notice was written in 1868, and is reproduced\npractically unaltered. Were it to be brought up to the present date, 1886,\nI should have to mention Whitman's books _Two Rivulets_ and _Specimen-days\nand Collect_, and the fact that for several years past he has been\npartially disabled by a paralytic attack. He now lives at Camden, New\nJersey.\n\n1886.\nW. M. R.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO LEAVES OF GRASS.\n\n\nAmerica does not repel the past, or what it has produced under its forms,\nor amid other politics, or the idea of castes, or the old religions;\naccepts the lesson with calmness; is not so impatient as has been supposed\nthat the slough still sticks to opinions and manners and literature while\nthe life which served its requirements has passed into the new life of the\nnew forms; perceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating and\nsleeping rooms of the house; perceives that it waits a little while in the\ndoor, that it was fittest for its days, that its action has descended to\nthe stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches, and that he shall be\nfittest for his days.\n\nThe Americans, of all nations at any time upon the earth, have probably the\nfullest poetical Nature. The United States themselves are essentially the\ngreatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most\nstirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here\nat last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the\nbroadcast doings of the day and night. Here is not merely a nation, but a\nteeming nation of nations. Here is action untied from strings, necessarily\nblind to particulars and details, magnificently moving in vast masses.\n\nHere is the hospitality which for ever indicates heroes. Here are the\nroughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul\nloves. Here the performance, disdaining the trivial, unapproached in the\ntremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its\nperspective, spreads with crampless and flowing breadth, and showers its\nprolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must indeed own the riches\nof the summer and winter, and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from\nthe ground, or the orchards drop apples, or the bays contain fish, or men\nbeget children.\n\nOther states indicate themselves in their deputies: but the genius of the\nUnited States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in\nits ambassadors or authors or colleges, or churches, or parlours, nor even\nin its newspapers or inventors, but always most in the common people. Their\nmanners, speech, dress, friendships,--the freshness and candour of their\nphysiognomy--the picturesque looseness of their carriage--their deathless\nattachment to freedom--their aversion to anything indecorous or soft or\nmean--the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the\ncitizens of all other states--the fierceness of their roused resentment--\ntheir curiosity and welcome of novelty--their self-esteem and wonderful\nsympathy--their susceptibility to a slight--the air they have of persons\nwho never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors--the\nfluency of their speech--their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly\ntenderness and native elegance of soul--their good temper and open-\nhandedness--the terrible significance of their elections, the President's\ntaking off his hat to them, not they to him--these too are unrhymed poetry.\nIt awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.\n\nThe largeness of nature or the nation were monstrous without a\ncorresponding largeness and generosity of the spirit of the citizen. Not\nnature, nor swarming states, nor streets and steamships, nor prosperous\nbusiness, nor farms nor capital nor learning, may suffice for the ideal of\nman, nor suffice the poet. No reminiscences may suffice either. A live\nnation can always cut a deep mark, and can have the best authority the\ncheapest--namely, from its own soul. This is the sum of the profitable uses\nof individuals or states, and of present action and grandeur, and of the\nsubjects of poets.--As if it were necessary to trot back generation after\ngeneration to the eastern records! As if the beauty and sacredness of the\ndemonstrable must fall behind that of the mythical! As if men do not make\ntheir mark out of any times! As if the opening of the western continent by\ndiscovery, and what has transpired since in North and South America, were\nless than the small theatre of the antique, or the aimless sleep-walking of\nthe Middle Ages! The pride of the United States leaves the wealth and\nfinesse of the cities, and all returns of commerce and agriculture, and all\nthe magnitude or geography or shows of exterior victory, to enjoy the breed\nof full-sized men, or one full-sized man unconquerable and simple.\n\nThe American poets are to enclose old and new; for America is the race of\nraces. Of them a bard is to be commensurate with a people. To him the other\ncontinents arrive as contributions: he gives them reception for their sake\nand his own sake. His spirit responds to his country's spirit: he\nincarnates its geography and natural life and rivers and lakes. Mississippi\nwith annual freshets and changing chutes, Missouri and Columbia and Ohio\nand Saint Lawrence with the Falls and beautiful masculine Hudson, do not\nembouchure where they spend themselves more than they embouchure into him.\nThe blue breadth over the inland sea of Virginia and Maryland, and the sea\noff Massachusetts and Maine, and over Manhattan Bay, and over Champlain and\nErie, and over Ontario and Huron and Michigan and Superior, and over the\nTexan and Mexican and Floridian and Cuban seas, and over the seas off\nCalifornia and Oregon, is not tallied by the blue breadth of the waters\nbelow more than the breadth of above and below is tallied by him. When the\nlong Atlantic coast stretches longer, and the Pacific coast stretches\nlonger, he easily stretches with them north or south. He spans between them\nalso from east to west, and reflects what is between them. On him rise\nsolid growths that offset the growths of pine and cedar and hemlock and\nlive-oak and locust and chestnut and cypress and hickory and lime-tree and\ncottonwood and tulip-tree and cactus and wild-vine and tamarind and\npersimmon, and tangles as tangled as any cane-brake or swamp, and forests\ncoated with transparent ice and icicles, hanging from the boughs and\ncrackling in the wind, and sides and peaks of mountains, and pasturage\nsweet and free as savannah or upland or prairie,--with flights and songs\nand screams that answer those of the wild-pigeon and high-hold and orchard-\noriole and coot and surf-duck and red-shouldered-bawk and fish-hawk and\nwhite-ibis and Indian-hen and cat-owl and water-pheasant and qua-bird and\npied-sheldrake and blackbird and mocking-bird and buzzard and condor and\nnight-heron and eagle. To him the hereditary countenance descends, both\nmother's and father's. To him enter the essences of the real things and\npast and present events--of the enormous diversity of temperature and\nagriculture and mines--the tribes of red aborigines--the weather-beaten\nvessels entering new ports, or making landings on rocky coasts--the first\nsettlements north or south--the rapid stature and muscle--the haughty\ndefiance of '76, and the war and peace and formation of the constitution--\nthe union always surrounded by blatherers, and always calm and\nimpregnable--the perpetual coming of immigrants--the wharf-hemmed cities\nand superior marine--the unsurveyed interior--the loghouses and clearings\nand wild animals and hunters and trappers--the free commerce--the fisheries\nand whaling and gold-digging--the endless gestations of new states--the\nconvening of Congress every December, the members duly coming up from all\nclimates and the uttermost parts--the noble character of the young\nmechanics and of all free American workmen and workwomen--the general\nardour and friendliness and enterprise--the perfect equality of the female\nwith the male--the large amativeness--the fluid movement of the\npopulation--the factories and mercantile life and labour-saving machinery--\nthe Yankee swap--the New York firemen and the target excursion--the\nSouthern plantation life--the character of the north-east and of the north-\nwest and south-west-slavery, and the tremulous spreading of hands to\nprotect it, and the stern opposition to it which shall never cease till it\nceases, or the speaking of tongues and the moving of lips cease. For such\nthe expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and new. It is to\nbe indirect, and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its quality goes\nthrough these to much more. Let the age and wars of other nations be\nchanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and that finish the\nverse. Not so the great psalm of the republic. Here the theme is creative,\nand has vista. Here comes one among the well-beloved stone-cutters, and\nplans with decision and science, and sees the solid and beautiful forms of\nthe future where there are now no solid forms.\n\nOf all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most\nneeds poets, and will doubtless have the greatest, and use them the\ngreatest. Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as\ntheir poets shall. Of all mankind, the great poet is the equable man. Not\nin him, but off from him, things are grotesque or eccentric, or fail of\ntheir sanity. Nothing out of its place is good, and nothing in its place is\nbad. He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportions, neither\nmore nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse, and he is the key. He is\nthe equaliser of his age and land: he supplies what wants supplying, and\nchecks what wants checking. If peace is the routine, out of him speaks the\nspirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities,\nencouraging agriculture and the arts and commerce--lighting the study of\nman, the soul, immortality--federal, state or municipal government,\nmarriage, health, free-trade, intertravel by land and sea--nothing too\nclose, nothing too far off,--the stars not too far off. In war, he is the\nmost deadly force of the war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot: he\nfetches parks of artillery, the best that engineer ever knew. If the time\nbecomes slothful and heavy, he knows how to arouse it: he can make every\nword he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or\nobedience or legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master\nhim, he masters it. High up out of reach, he stands turning a concentrated\nlight; he turns the pivot with his finger; he baffles the swiftest runners\nas he stands, and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying\ntoward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady\nfaith; he spreads out his dishes; he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that\ngrows men and women. His brain is the ultimate brain. He is no arguer, he\nis judgment. He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling\naround a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith.\nHis thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul\nand eternity and God, off of his equal plane, he is silent. He sees\neternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement: he sees eternity\nin men and women,--he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. Faith\nis the antiseptic of the soul,--it pervades the common people and preserves\nthem: they never give up believing and expecting and trusting. There is\nthat indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person\nthat humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius. The poet\nsees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and\nperfect as the greatest artist. The power to destroy or remould is freely\nused by him, but never the power of attack. What is past is past. If he\ndoes not expose superior models, and prove himself by every step he takes,\nhe is not what is wanted. The presence of the greatest poet conquers; not\nparleying or struggling or any prepared attempts. Now he has passed that\nway, see after him! there is not left any vestige of despair or misanthropy\nor cunning or exclusiveness, or the ignominy of a nativity or colour, or\ndelusion of hell or the necessity of hell; and no man thenceforward shall\nbe degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin.\n\nThe greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into\nanything that was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and\nlife of the universe. He is a seer--he is individual--he is complete in\nhimself: the others are as good as he; only he sees it, and they do not. He\nis not one of the chorus--he does not stop for any regulation--he is the\nPresident of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the\nrest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses\ncorroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and\nforeruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks\nall the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the\nearth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is\nimpossible or baseless or vague? after you have once just opened the space\nof a peachpit, and given audience to far and near and to the sunset, and\nhad all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without\nconfusion or jostling or jam.\n\nThe land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the\norbs, the forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes: but folks\nexpect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which\nalways attach to dumb real objects,--they expect him to indicate the path\nbetween reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well\nenough--probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters,\nwoodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields, the\nlove of healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons, drivers of\nhorses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old varied sign\nof the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic, in\noutdoor people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive: some may,\nbut they never can. The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or\nuniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints\nor good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, and is in the\nsoul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more\nluxuriant rhyme; and of uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own\nroots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems\nshow the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as unerringly and\nloosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the\nshapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume\nimpalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music\nor orations or recitations are not independent, but dependent. All beauty\ncomes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in\nconjunction in a man or woman, it is enough--the fact will prevail through\nthe universe: but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail.\nWho troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost. This is what\nyou shall do: love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give\nalms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your\nincome and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have\npatience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing\nknown or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful\nuneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families,\nread these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life,\nre-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book,\ndismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a\ngreat poem, and have the richest fluency, not only in its words, but in the\nsilent lines of its lips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and\nin every motion and joint of your body. The poet shall not spend his time\nin unneeded work. He shall know that the ground is always ready ploughed\nand manured: others may not know it, but he shall. He shall go directly to\nthe creation. His trust shall master the trust of everything he touches,\nand shall master all attachment.\n\nThe known universe has one complete lover, and that is the greatest poet.\nHe consumes an eternal passion, and is indifferent which chance happens,\nand which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune, and persuades\ndaily and hourly his delicious pay. What balks or breaks others is fuel for\nhis burning progress to contact and amorous joy. Other proportions of the\nreception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his proportions. All expected\nfrom heaven or from the highest he is rapport with in the sight of the\ndaybreak, or a scene of the winter woods, or the presence of children\nplaying, or with his arm round the neck of a man or woman. His love, above\nall love, has leisure and expanse--he leaves room ahead of himself. He is\nno irresolute or suspicious lover--he is sure--he scorns intervals. His\nexperience and the showers and thrills are not for nothing. Nothing can jar\nhim: suffering and darkness cannot--death and fear cannot. To him complaint\nand jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the earth--he saw\nthem buried. The sea is not surer of the shore, or the shore of the sea,\nthan he is of the fruition of his love, and of all perfection and beauty.\n\nThe fruition of beauty is no chance of hit or miss--it is inevitable as\nlife--it is exact and plumb as gravitation. From the eyesight proceeds\nanother eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another hearing, and from\nthe voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of the harmony of\nthings with man. To these respond perfections, not only in the committees\nthat were supposed to stand for the rest, but in the rest themselves just\nthe same. These understand the law of perfection in masses and floods--that\nits finish is to each for itself and onward from itself--that it is profuse\nand impartial--that there is not a minute of the light or dark, nor an acre\nof the earth or sea, without it--nor any direction of the sky, nor any\ntrade or employment, nor any turn of events. This is the reason that about\nthe proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance,--one part\ndoes not need to be thrust above another. The best singer is not the one\nwho has the most lithe and powerful organ: the pleasure of poems is not in\nthem that take the handsomest measure and similes and sound.\n\nWithout effort, and without exposing in the least how it is done, the\ngreatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and\nscenes and persons, some more and some less, to bear on your individual\ncharacter, as you hear or read. To do this well is to compete with the laws\nthat pursue and follow time. What is the purpose must surely be there, and\nthe clue of it must be there; and the faintest indication is the indication\nof the best, and then becomes the clearest indication. Past and present and\nfuture are not disjoined, but joined. The greatest poet forms the\nconsistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead\nout of their coffins, and stands them again on their feet: he says to the\npast, Rise and walk before me that I may realise you. He learns the\nlesson--he places himself where the future becomes present. The greatest\npoet does not only dazzle his rays over character and scenes and\npassions,--he finally ascends and finishes all: he exhibits the pinnacles\nthat no man can tell what they are for or what is beyond--he glows a moment\non the extremest verge. He is most wonderful in his last half-hidden smile\nor frown: by that flash of the moment of parting the one that sees it shall\nbe encouraged or terrified afterward for many years. The greatest poet does\nnot moralise or make applications of morals,--he knows the soul. The soul\nhas that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any\nlessons but its own. But it has sympathy as measureless as its pride, and\nthe one balances the other, and neither can stretch too far while it\nstretches in company with the other. The inmost secrets of art sleep with\nthe twain. The greatest poet has lain close betwixt both, and they are\nvital in his style and thoughts.\n\nThe art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of\nletters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity,--nothing can\nmake up for excess or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave\nof impulse, and pierce intellectual depths, and give all subjects their\narticulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in\nliterature with the perfect rectitude and insousiance of the movements of\nanimals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods\nand grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph of art. If you, have\nlooked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on one of the masters of\nthe artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight\nof the grey-gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse,\nor the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the\nsun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward,\nwith any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The greatest\npoet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and\nthings without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself.\nHe swears to his art,--I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my\nwriting any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between me\nand the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the\nrichest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may\nexalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or\nheat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or\npourtray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition.\nYou shall stand by my side, and look in the mirror with me.\n\nThe old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by\ntheir unconstraint. A heroic person walks at his ease through and out of\nthat custom or precedent or authority that suits him not. Of the traits of\nthe brotherhood of writers, savans, musicians, inventors, and artists,\nnothing is finer than silent defiance advancing from new free forms. In the\nneed of poems, philosophy, politics, mechanism, science, behaviour, the\ncraft of art, an appropriate native grand opera, shipcraft or any craft, he\nis greatest for ever and for ever who contributes the greatest original\npractical example. The cleanest expression is that which finds no sphere\nworthy of itself, and makes one.\n\nThe messages of great poets to each man and woman are,--Come to us on equal\nterms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you; what we\nenclose you enclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did you suppose there\ncould be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be unnumbered Supremes, and\nthat one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight\ncountervails another--and that men can be good or grand only of the\nconsciousness of their supremacy within them. What do you think is the\ngrandeur of storms and dismemberments, and the deadliest battles and\nwrecks, and the wildest fury of the elements, and the power of the sea, and\nthe motion of nature, and of the throes of human desires, and dignity and\nhate and love? It is that something in the soul which says,--Rage on, whirl\non, I tread master here and everywhere; master of the spasms of the sky and\nof the shatter of the sea, master of nature and passion and death, and of\nall terror and all pain.\n\nThe American bards shall be marked for generosity and affection and for\nencouraging competitors: they shall be kosmos--without monopoly or\nsecrecy--glad to pass anything to any one--hungry for equals night and day.\nThey shall not be careful of riches and privilege,--they shall be riches\nand privilege: they shall perceive who the most affluent man is. The most\naffluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees by equivalents out\nof the stronger wealth of himself. The American bard shall delineate no\nclass of persons, nor one or two out of the strata of interests, nor love\nmost nor truth most, nor the soul most nor the body most; and not be for\nthe eastern states more than the western, or the northern states more than\nthe southern.\n\nExact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest\npoet, but always his encouragement and support. The outset and remembrance\nare there--there the arms that lifted him first and brace him best--there\nhe returns after all his goings and comings. The sailor and traveller, the\nanatomist, chemist, astronomer, geologist, phrenologist, spiritualist,\nmathematician, historian, and lexicographer, are not poets; but they are\nthe lawgivers of poets, and their construction underlies the structure of\nevery perfect poem. No matter what rises or is uttered, they send the seed\nof the conception of it: of them and by them stand the visible proofs of\nsouls. If there shall be love and content between the father and the son,\nand if the greatness of the son is the exuding of the greatness of the\nfather, there shall be love between the poet and the man of demonstrable\nscience. In the beauty of poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\n\nGreat is the faith of the flush of knowledge, and of the investigation of\nthe depths of qualities and things. Cleaving and circling here swells the\nsoul of the poet: yet is president of itself always. The depths are\nfathomless, and therefore calm. The innocence and nakedness are resumed--\nthey are neither modest nor immodest. The whole theory of the special and\nsupernatural, and all that was twined with it or educed out of it, departs\nas a dream. What has ever happened, what happens, and whatever may or shall\nhappen, the vital laws enclose all: they are sufficient for any case and\nfor all cases--none to be hurried or retarded--any miracle of affairs or\npersons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme where every motion, and every\nspear of grass, and the frames and spirits of men and women, and all that\nconcerns them, are unspeakably perfect miracles, all referring to all, and\neach distinct and in its place. It is also not consistent with the reality\nof the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more\ndivine than men and women.\n\nMen and women, and the earth and all upon it, are simply to be taken as\nthey are, and the investigation of their past and present and future shall\nbe unintermitted, and shall be done with perfect candour. Upon this basis\nphilosophy speculates, ever looking toward the poet, ever regarding the\neternal tendencies of all toward happiness, never inconsistent with what is\nclear to the senses and to the soul. For the eternal tendencies of all\ntoward happiness make the only point of sane philosophy. Whatever\ncomprehends less than that--whatever is less than the laws of light and of\nastronomical motion--or less than the laws that follow the thief, the liar,\nthe glutton, and the drunkard, through this life, and doubtless afterward--\nor less than vast stretches of time, or the slow formation of density, or\nthe patient upheaving of strata--is of no account. Whatever would put God\nin a poem or system of philosophy as contending against some being or\ninfluence is also of no account. Sanity and ensemble characterise the great\nmaster:--spoilt in one principle, all is spoilt. The great master has\nnothing to do with miracles. He sees health for himself in being one of the\nmass--he sees the hiatus in singular eminence. To the perfect shape comes\ncommon ground. To be under the general law is great, for that is to\ncorrespond with it. The master knows that he is unspeakably great, and that\nall are unspeakably great--that nothing, for instance, is greater than to\nconceive children, and bring them up well--that to be is just as great as\nto perceive or tell.\n\nIn the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is\nindispensable. Liberty takes the adherence of heroes wherever men and women\nexist; but never takes any adherence or welcome from the rest more than\nfrom poets. They are the voice and exposition of liberty. They out of ages\nare worthy the grand idea,--to them it is confided, and they must sustain\nit. Nothing has precedence of it, and nothing can warp or degrade it. The\nattitude of great poets is to cheer up slaves and horrify despots. The turn\nof their necks, the sound of their feet, the motions of their wrists, are\nfull of hazard to the one and hope to the other. Come nigh them a while,\nand, though they neither speak nor advise, you shall learn the faithful\nAmerican lesson. Liberty is poorly served by men whose good intent is\nquelled from one failure or two failures or any number of failures, or from\nthe casual indifference or ingratitude of the people, or from the sharp\nshow of the tushes of power, or the bringing to bear soldiers and cannon or\nany penal statutes. Liberty relies upon itself, invites no one, promises\nnothing, sits in calmness and light, is positive and composed, and knows no\ndiscouragement. The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent\nadvance and retreat--the enemy triumphs--the prison, the handcuffs, the\niron necklace and anklet, the scaffold, garrote, and lead-balls, do their\nwork--the cause is asleep--the strong throats are choked with their own\nblood--the young men drop their eyelashes toward the ground when they pass\neach other ... and is liberty gone out of that place? No, never. When\nliberty goes, it is not the first to go, nor the second or third to go: it\nwaits for all the rest to go--it is the last. When the memories of the old\nmartyrs are faded utterly away--when the large names of patriots are\nlaughed at in the public halls from the lips of the orators--when the boys\nare no more christened after the same, but christened after tyrants and\ntraitors instead--when the laws of the free are grudgingly permitted, and\nlaws for informers and blood-money are sweet to the taste of the people--\nwhen I and you walk abroad upon the earth, stung with compassion at the\nsight of numberless brothers answering our equal friendship, and calling no\nman master--and when we are elated with noble joy at the sight of slaves--\nwhen the soul retires in the cool communion of the night, and surveys its\nexperience, and has much ecstasy over the word and deed that put back a\nhelpless innocent person into the gripe of the gripers or into any cruel\ninferiority--when those in all parts of these states who could easier\nrealise the true American character, but do not yet[1]--when the swarms of\ncringers, suckers, doughfaces, lice of politics, planners of sly\ninvolutions for their own preferment to city offices or state legislatures\nor the judiciary or Congress or the Presidency, obtain a response of love\nand natural deference from the people, whether they get the offices or no--\nwhen it is better to be a bound booby and rogue in office at a high salary\nthan the poorest free mechanic or farmer, with his hat unmoved from his\nhead, and firm eyes, and a candid and generous heart--and when servility by\ntown or state or the federal government, or any oppression on a large scale\nor small scale, can be tried on without its own punishment following duly\nafter in exact proportion, against the smallest chance of escape--or rather\nwhen all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any\npart of the earth--then only shall the instinct of liberty be discharged\nfrom that part of the earth.\n\n[Footnote 1: This clause is obviously imperfect in some respect: it is here\nreproduced _verbatim_ from the American edition.]\n\nAs the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real body and\nsoul and in the pleasure of things, they possess the superiority of\ngenuineness over all fiction and romance. As they emit themselves, facts\nare showered over with light--the daylight is lit with more volatile\nlight--also the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many-\nfold. Each precise object or condition or combination or process exhibits a\nbeauty: the multiplication-table its--old age its--the carpenter's trade\nits--the grand opera its: the huge-hulled clean-shaped New York clipper at\nsea under steam or full sail gleams with unmatched beauty--the American\ncircles and large harmonies of government gleam with theirs, and the\ncommonest definite intentions and actions with theirs. The poets of the\nkosmos advance through all interpositions and coverings and turmoils and\nstratagems to first principles. They are of use--they dissolve poverty from\nits need, and riches from its conceit. You large proprietor, they say,\nshall not realise or perceive more than any one else. The owner of the\nlibrary is not he who holds a legal title to it, having bought and paid for\nit. Any one and every one is owner of the library who can read the same\nthrough all the varieties of tongues and subjects and styles, and in whom\nthey enter with ease, and take residence and force toward paternity and\nmaternity, and make supple and powerful and rich and large. These American\nstates, strong and healthy and accomplished, shall receive no pleasure from\nviolations of natural models, and must not permit them. In paintings or\nmouldings or carvings in mineral or wood, or in the illustrations of books\nor newspapers, or in any comic or tragic prints, or in the patterns of\nwoven stuffs, or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes, or to\nput upon cornices or monuments or on the prows or sterns of ships, or to\nput anywhere before the human eye indoors or out, that which distorts\nhonest shapes, or which creates unearthly beings or places or\ncontingencies, is a nuisance and revolt. Of the human form especially, it\nis so great it must never be made ridiculous. Of ornaments to a work,\nnothing _outré_ can be allowed; but those ornaments can be allowed that\nconform to the perfect facts of the open air, and that flow out of the\nnature of the work, and come irrepressibly from it, and are necessary to\nthe completion of the work. Most works are most beautiful without ornament.\nExaggerations will be revenged in human physiology. Clean and vigorous\nchildren are conceived only in those communities where the models of\nnatural forms are public every day. Great genius and the people of these\nstates must never be demeaned to romances. As soon as histories are\nproperly told, there is no more need of romances.\n\nThe great poets are also to be known by the absence in them of tricks, and\nby the justification of perfect personal candour. Then folks echo a new\ncheap joy and a divine voice leaping from their brains. How beautiful is\ncandour! All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candour.\nHenceforth let no man of us lie, for we have seen that openness wins the\ninner and outer world, and that there is no single exception, and that\nnever since our earth gathered itself in a mass has deceit or subterfuge or\nprevarication attracted its smallest particle or the faintest tinge of a\nshade--and that through the enveloping wealth and rank of a state or the\nwhole republic of states a sneak or sly person shall be discovered and\ndespised--and that the soul has never been once fooled and never can be\nfooled--and thrift without the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid\npuff--and there never grew up in any of the continents of the globe, nor\nupon any planet or satellite or star, nor upon the asteroids, nor in any\npart of ethereal space, nor in the midst of density, nor under the fluid\nwet of the sea, nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes,\nnor at any time during the changes of life, nor in that condition that\nfollows what we term death, nor in any stretch of abeyance or action\nafterward of vitality, nor in any process of formation or reformation\nanywhere, a being whose instinct hated the truth.\n\nExtreme caution or prudence, the soundest organic health, large hope and\ncomparison and fondness for women and children, large alimentiveness and\ndestructiveness and causality, with a perfect sense of the oneness of\nnature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs--\nthese are called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of\nthe greatest poet from his birth. Caution seldom goes far enough. It has\nbeen thought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself\nto solid gains, and did well for himself and his family, and completed a\nlawful life without debt or crime. The greatest poet sees and admits these\neconomies as he sees the economies of food and sleep, but has higher\nnotions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives a few slight\nattentions at the latch of the gate. The premises of the prudence of life\nare not the hospitality of it, or the ripeness and harvest of it. Beyond\nthe independence of a little sum laid aside for burial-money, and of a few\nclapboards around and shingles overhead on a lot of American soil owned,\nand the easy dollars that supply the year's plain clothing and meals, the\nmelancholy prudence of the abandonment of such a great being as a man is to\nthe toss and pallor of years of money-making, with all their scorching days\nand icy nights, and all their stifling deceits and underhanded dodgings, or\ninfinitesimals of parlours, or shameless stuffing while others starve,--and\nall the loss of the bloom and odour of the earth, and of the flowers and\natmosphere, and of the sea, and of the true taste of the women and men you\npass or have to do with in youth or middle age, and the issuing sickness\nand desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naïveté,\nand the ghastly chatter of a death without serenity or majesty,--is the\ngreat fraud upon modern civilisation and forethought; blotching the surface\nand system which civilisation undeniably drafts, and moistening with tears\nthe immense features it spreads and spreads with such velocity before the\nreached kisses of the soul. Still the right explanation remains to be made\nabout prudence. The prudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the\nmost esteemed life appears too faint for the eye to observe at all when\nlittle and large alike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence\nsuitable for immortality. What is wisdom that fills the thinness of a year\nor seventy or eighty years, to wisdom spaced out by ages, and coming back\nat a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents and the\nclear faces of wedding-guests as far as you can look in every direction\nrunning gaily toward you? Only the soul is of itself--all else has\nreference to what ensues. All that a person does or thinks is of\nconsequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in\na day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime or the hour of death,\nbut the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect\nlifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the direct. The\nspirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body. Not one\nname of word or deed--not of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers--\nnot peculation or cunning or betrayal or murder--no serpentine poison of\nthose that seduce women--not the foolish yielding of women--not of the\nattainment of gain by discreditable means--not any nastiness of appetite--\nnot any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to\nsons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their\nboys--not of greedy looks or malignant wishes--nor any of the wiles\npractised by people upon themselves--ever is or ever can be stamped on the\nprogramme, but it is duly realised and returned, and that returned in\nfurther performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push of charity\nor personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason,\nwhether it bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary--to\nadd or subtract or divide is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned,\nwhite or black, legal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration\ndown the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or\nfemale does that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure\nprofit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe and through\nthe whole scope of it for ever. If the savage or felon is wise, it is\nwell--if the greatest poet or savant is wise, it is simply the same--if the\nPresident or chief justice is wise, it is the same--if the young mechanic\nor farmer is wise, it is no more or less. The interest will come round--all\nwill come round. All the best actions of war and peace--all help given to\nrelatives and strangers, and the poor and old and sorrowful, and young\nchildren and widows and the sick, and to all shunned persons--all\nfurtherance of fugitives and of the escape of slaves--all the self-denial\nthat stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others take the seats of the\nboats--all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a\nfriend's sake or opinion's sake--all pains of enthusiasts scoffed at by\ntheir neighbours--all the vast sweet love and precious suffering of\nmothers--all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded--all the\ngrandeur and good of the few ancient nations whose fragments of annals we\ninherit--and all the good of the hundreds of far mightier and more ancient\nnations unknown to us by name or date or location--all that was ever\nmanfully begun, whether it succeeded or no--all that has at any time been\nwell suggested out of the divine heart of man, or by the divinity of his\nmouth, or by the shaping of his great hands--and all that is well thought\nor done this day on any part of the surface of the globe, or on any of the\nwandering stars or fixed stars by those there as we are here--or that is\nhenceforth to be well thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any\none--these singly and wholly inured at their time, and inured now, and will\ninure always, to the identities from which they sprung or shall spring. Did\nyou guess any of them lived only its moment? The world does not so exist--\nno parts, palpable or impalpable, so exist--no result exists now without\nbeing from its long antecedent result, and that from its antecedent, and so\nbackward without the farthest mentionable spot coining a bit nearer the\nbeginning than any other spot.... Whatever satisfies the soul is truth. The\nprudence of the greatest poet answers at last the craving and glut of the\nsoul, is not contemptuous of less ways of prudence if they conform to its\nways, puts off nothing, permits no let-up for its own case or any case, has\nno particular Sabbath or judgment-day, divides not the living from the dead\nor the righteous from the unrighteous, is satisfied with the present,\nmatches every thought or act by its correlative, knows no possible\nforgiveness or deputed atonement--knows that the young man who composedly\nperilled his life and lost it has done exceeding well for himself, while\nthe man who has not perilled his life, and retains it to old age in riches\nand ease, has perhaps achieved nothing for himself worth mentioning--and\nthat only that person has no great prudence to learn who has learnt to\nprefer long-lived things, and favours body and soul the same, and perceives\nthe indirect assuredly following the direct, and what evil or good he does\nleaping onward and waiting to meet him again--and who in his spirit in any\nemergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death.\n\nThe direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to-day. If he\ndoes not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tides--\nand if he does not attract his own land body and soul to himself, and hang\non its neck with incomparable love--and if he be not himself the age\ntransfigured--and if to him is not opened the eternity which gives\nsimilitude to all periods and locations and processes and animate and\ninanimate forms, and which is the bond of time, and rises up from its\ninconceivable vagueness and infiniteness in the swimming shape of to-day,\nand is held by the ductile anchors of life, and makes the present spot the\npassage from what was to what shall be, and commits itself to the\nrepresentation of this wave of an hour, and this one of the sixty beautiful\nchildren of the wave--let him merge in the general run and wait his\ndevelopment.... Still, the final test of poems or any character or work\nremains. The prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead, and judges\nperformer or performance after the changes of time. Does it live through\nthem? Does it still hold on untired? Will the same style, and the direction\nof genius to similar points, be satisfactory now? Has no new discovery in\nscience, or arrival at superior planes of thought and judgment and\nbehaviour, fixed him or his so that either can be looked down upon? Have\nthe marches of tens and hundreds and thousands of years made willing\ndetours to the right hand and the left hand for his sake? Is he beloved\nlong and long after he is buried? Does the young man think often of him?\nand the young woman think often of him? and do the middle-aged and the old\nthink of him?\n\nA great poem is for ages and ages, in common, and for all degrees and\ncomplexions, and all departments and sects, and for a woman as much as a\nman, and a man as much as a woman. A great poem is no finish to a man or\nwoman, but rather a beginning. Has any one fancied he could sit at last\nunder some due authority, and rest satisfied with explanations, and realise\nand be content and full? To no such terminus does the greatest poet bring--\nhe brings neither cessation nor sheltered fatness and ease. The touch of\nhim tells in action. Whom he takes he takes with firm sure grasp into live\nregions previously unattained. Thenceforward is no rest: they see the space\nand ineffable sheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums.\nThe companion of him beholds the birth and progress of stars, and learns\none of the meanings. Now there shall be a man cohered out of tumult and\nchaos. The elder encourages the younger, and shows him how: they two shall\nlaunch off fearlessly together till the new world fits an orbit for itself,\nand looks unabashed on the lesser orbits of the stars, and sweeps through\nthe ceaseless rings, and shall never be quiet again.\n\nThere will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. They may wait a\nwhile--perhaps a generation or two,--dropping off by degrees. A superior\nbreed shall take their place--the gangs of kosmos and prophets _en masse_\nshall take their place. A new order shall arise; and they shall be the\npriests of man, and every man shall be his own priest. The churches built\nunder their umbrage shall be the churches of men and women. Through the\ndivinity of themselves shall the kosmos and the new breed of poets be\ninterpreters of men and women and of all events and things. They shall find\ntheir inspiration in real objects to-day, symptoms of the past and future.\nThey shall not deign to defend immortality, or God, or the perfection of\nthings, or liberty, or the exquisite beauty and reality of the soul. They\nshall arise in America, and be responded to from the remainder of the\nearth.\n\nThe English language befriends the grand American expression--it is brawny\nenough, and limber and full enough. On the tough stock of a race who,\nthrough all change of circumstance, was never without the idea of political\nliberty, which is the animus of all liberty, it has attracted the terms of\ndaintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues. It is the powerful\nlanguage of resistance--it is the dialect of common sense. It is the speech\nof the proud and melancholy races, and of all who aspire. It is the chosen\ntongue to express growth, faith, self-esteem, freedom, justice, equality,\nfriendliness, amplitude, prudence, decision, and courage. It is the medium\nthat shall well nigh express the inexpressible.\n\nNo great literature, nor any like style of behaviour or oratory or social\nintercourse or household arrangements or public institutions, or the\ntreatment by bosses of employed people, nor executive detail, or detail of\nthe army or navy, nor spirit of legislation, or courts or police, or\ntuition or architecture, or songs or amusements, or the costumes of young\nmen, can long elude the jealous and passionate instinct of American\nstandards. Whether or no the sign appears from the mouths of the people, it\nthrobs a live interrogation in every freeman's and freewoman's heart after\nthat which passes by, or this built to remain. Is it uniform with my\ncountry? Are its disposals without ignominious distinctions? Is it for the\never-growing communes of brothers and lovers, large, well united, proud\nbeyond the old models, generous beyond all models? Is it something grown\nfresh out of the fields, or drawn from the sea, for use to me, to-day,\nhere? I know that what answers for me, an American, must answer for any\nindividual or nation that serves for a part of my materials. Does this\nanswer? or is it without reference to universal needs? or sprung of the\nneeds of the less developed society of special ranks? or old needs of\npleasure overlaid by modern science and forms? Does this acknowledge\nliberty with audible and absolute acknowledgment, and set slavery at\nnought, for life and death? Will it help breed one good-shaped man, and a\nwoman to be his perfect and independent mate? Does it improve manners? Is\nit for the nursing of the young of the republic? Does it solve readily with\nthe sweet milk of the breasts of the mother of many children? Has it too\nthe old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality? Does it look with the\nsame love on the last-born and on those hardening toward stature, and on\nthe errant, and on those who disdain all strength of assault outside of\ntheir own?\n\nThe poems distilled from other poems will probably pass away. The coward\nwill surely pass away. The expectation of the vital and great can only be\nsatisfied by the demeanour of the vital and great. The swarms of the\npolished, deprecating, and reflectors, and the polite, float off and leave\nno remembrance. America prepares with composure and goodwill for the\nvisitors that have sent word. It is not intellect that is to be their\nwarrant and welcome. The talented, the artist, the ingenious, the editor,\nthe statesman, the erudite--they are not unappreciated--they fall in their\nplace and do their work. The soul of the nation also does its work. No\ndisguise can pass on it--no disguise can conceal from it. It rejects none,\nit permits all. Only toward as good as itself and toward the like of itself\nwill it advance half-way. An individual is as superb as a nation when he\nhas the qualities which make a superb nation. The soul of the largest and\nwealthiest and proudest nation may well go half-way to meet that of its\npoets. The signs are effectual. There is no fear of mistake. If the one is\ntrue, the other is true. The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs\nhim as affectionately as he has absorbed it.\n\n[Script: Meantime, dear friend,\nFarewell, Walt Whitman.]\n\n\n\n\n_CHANTS DEMOCRATIC._\n\n\n\n_STARTING FROM PAUMANOK._\n\n\n1.\n\nStarting from fish-shape Paumanok,[1] where I was born,\nWell-begotten, and raised by a perfect mother;\nAfter roaming many lands--lover of populous pavements;\nDweller in Mannahatta,[2] city of ships, my city,--or on southern savannas;\nOr a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and gun--or a miner in\n        California;\nOr rude in my home in Dakotah's woods, my diet meat, my drink from the\n        spring;\nOr withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,\nFar from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy;\nAware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri--aware of mighty\n        Niagara\nAware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains--the hirsute and strong-\n        breasted bull;\nOf earths, rocks, fifth-month flowers, experienced--stars, rain, snow, my\n        amaze;\nHaving studied the mocking-bird's tones, and the mountain hawk's,\nAnd heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit thrush, from the\n        swamp-cedars,\nSolitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.\n\n\n2.\n\nVictory, union, faith, identity, time,\nYourself, the present and future lands, the indissoluble compacts, riches,\n        mystery,\nEternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.\n\nThis, then, is life;\nHere is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.\n\nHow curious! how real!\nUnder foot the divine soil--over head the sun.\n\nSee, revolving, the globe;\nThe ancestor-continents, away, grouped together;\nThe present and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus\n        between.\n\nSee, vast trackless spaces;\nAs in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill;\nCountless masses debouch upon them;\nThey are now covered with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.\n\nSee, projected through time,\nFor me an audience interminable.\n\nWith firm and regular step they wend--they never stop,\nSuccessions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;\nOne generation playing its part, and passing on,\nAnother generation playing its part, and passing on in its turn,\nWith faces turned sideways or backward towards me, to listen,\nWith eyes retrospective towards me.\n\n\n3.\n\nAmericanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian;\nForemost! century marches!

or for the profits of a\n        store?\nOr to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure, or a\n        lady's leisure?\n\nHave you reckoned the landscape took substance and form that it might be\n        painted in a picture?\nOr men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?\nOr the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious\n        combinations, and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the\n        savans?\nOr the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?\nOr the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?\nOr that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agriculture\n        itself?\n\nOld institutions--these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the\n        practice handed along in manufactures--will we rate them so high?\nWill we rate our cash and business high?--I have no objection;\nI rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and man I\n        rate beyond all rate.\n\nWe thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand;\nI do not say they are not grand and good, for they are;\nI am this day just as much in love with them as you;\nThen I am in love with you, and with all my fellows upon the earth.\n\nWe consider Bibles and religions divine--I do not say they are not divine;\nI say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still;\nIt is not they who give the life--it is you who give the life;\nLeaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they\n        are shed out of you.\n\n\n5.\n\nWhen the psalm sings, instead of the singer;\nWhen the script preaches, instead of the preacher;\nWhen the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that carved the\n        supporting desk;\nWhen I can touch the body of books, by night or by day, and when they touch\n        my body back again;\nWhen a university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child\n        convince;\nWhen the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's\n        daughter;\nWhen warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly\n        companions;\nI intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as I do of men and\n        women like you.\nThe sum of all known reverence I add up in you, whoever you are;\nThe President is there in the White House for you--it is not you who are\n        here for him;\nThe Secretaries act in their bureaus for you--not you here for them;\nThe Congress convenes every twelfth month for you;\nLaws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the going and\n        coming of commerce and mails, are all for you.\n\nList close, my scholars dear!\nAll doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge from you;\nAll sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are tallied\n        in you;\nThe gist of histories and statistics, as far back as the records reach, is\n        in you this hour, and myths and tales the same;\nIf you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?\nThe most renowned poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be\n        vacuums.\n\nAll architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;\nDid you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches\n        and cornices?\n\nAll music is what awakes from you, when you are reminded by the\n        instruments;\nIt is not the violins and the cornets--it is not the oboe nor the beating\n        drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet\n        romanza--nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of the women's\n        chorus,\nIt is nearer and farther than they.\n\n\n6.\n\nWill the whole come back then?\nCan each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is there\n        nothing greater or more?\nDoes all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen soul?\n\nStrange and hard that paradox true I give;\nObjects gross and the unseen Soul are one.\n\nHouse-building, measuring, sawing the boards;\nBlacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin-roofing, shingle-\n        dressing,\nShip-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging of side-walks\n        by flaggers,\nThe pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-kiln and brick-kiln,\nCoal-mines, and all that is down there,--the lamps in the darkness, echoes,\n        songs, what meditations, what vast native thoughts looking through\n        smutched faces,\nIronworks, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-banks--men around\n        feeling the melt with huge crowbars--lumps of ore, the due\n        combining of ore, limestone, coal--the blast-furnace and the\n        puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt at last--\n        the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron, the strong, clean\n        shaped T-rail for railroads;\nOilworks, silkworks, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, steam-saws, the\n        great mills and factories;\nStone-cutting, shapely trimmings for façades, or window or door lintels--\n        the mallet, the tooth-chisel, the jib to protect the thumb, Oakum,\n        the oakum-chisel, the caulking-iron--the kettle of boiling vault-\n        cement, and the fire under the kettle,\nThe cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the sawyer, the\n        mould of the moulder, the working knife of the butcher, the ice-\n        saw, and all the work with ice,\nThe implements for daguerreotyping--the tools of the rigger, grappler,\n        sail-maker, block-maker,\nGoods of gutta-percha, papier-mâché, colours, brushes, brush-making,\n        glaziers' implements,\nThe veneer and glue-pot, the confectioner's ornaments, the decanter and\n        glasses, the shears and flat-iron,\nThe awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart measure, the counter and\n        stool, the writing-pen of quill or metal--the making of all sorts\n        of edged tools,\nThe brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, everything that is done by\n        brewers, also by wine-makers, also vinegar-makers,\nLeather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting, distilling,\n        sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking--electro-plating,\n        electrotyping, stereotyping,\nStave-machines, planing-machines, reaping-machines,\n        ploughing-machines, thrashing-machines, steam waggons,\nThe cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray;\nPyrotechny, letting off coloured fireworks at night, fancy figures and\n        jets,\nBeef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher, the\n        butcher in his killing-clothes,\nThe pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, the scalder's tub,\n        gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul, and the plenteous\n        winter-work of pork-packing,\nFlour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice--the barrels and the half\n        and quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the high piles on wharves\n        and levees,\nThe men, and the work of the men, on railroads, coasters, fish-boats,\n        canals;\nThe daily routine of your own or any man's life--the shop, yard, store, or\n        factory;\nThese shows all near you by day and night-workmen! whoever you are, your\n        daily life!\nIn that and them the heft of the heaviest--in them far more than you\n        estimated, and far less also;\nIn them realities for you and me--in them poems for you and me;\nIn them, not yourself--you and your soul enclose all things, regardless of\n        estimation;\nIn them the development good--in them, all themes and hints.\n\nI do not affirm what you see beyond is futile--I do not advise you to stop;\nI do not say leadings you thought great are not great;\nBut I say that none lead to greater than those lead to.\n\n\n7.\n\nWill you seek afar off?

one!\nGrey-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve produced from a little seed sown!\nResting the grass amid and upon,\nTo be leaned, and to lean on.\n\nStrong shapes, and attributes of strong shapes--masculine trades, sights\n        and sounds;\nLong varied train of an emblem, dabs of music;\nFingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ.\n\n2.\n\nWelcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind;\nWelcome are lands of pine and oak;\nWelcome are lands of the lemon and fig;\nWelcome are lands of gold;\nWelcome are lands of wheat and maize--welcome those of the grape;\nWelcome are lands of sugar and rice;\nWelcome are cotton-lands--welcome those of the white potato and sweet\n        potato;\nWelcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies;\nWelcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings,\nWelcome the measureless grazing-lands--welcome the teeming soil of\n        orchards, flax, honey, hemp;\nWelcome just as much the other more hard-faced lands;\nLands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit lands;\nLands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores;\nLands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc;\nLANDS OF IRON! lands of the make of the axe!\n\n\n3.\n\nThe log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it;\nThe sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space cleared for a garden,\nThe irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after the storm is\n        lulled,\nThe wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,\nThe thought of ships struck in the storm, and put on their beam-ends, and\n        the cutting away of masts;\nThe sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashioned houses and barns;\nThe remembered print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men,\n        families, goods,\nThe disembarkation, the founding of a new city,\nThe voyage of those who sought a New England and found it--the outset\n        anywhere,\nThe settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,\nThe slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;\nThe beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,\nThe beauty of wood-boys and wood-men, with their clear untrimmed faces,\nThe beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,\nThe American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience\n        of restraint,\nThe loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the\n        solidification;\nThe butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and sloops,\n        the raftsman, the pioneer,\nLumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on\n        the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,\nThe glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural life\n        of the woods, the strong day's work,\nThe blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of\n        hemlock boughs, and the bearskin;\n--The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,\nThe preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,\nThe hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them\n        regular, Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises,\n        according as they were prepared,\nThe blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curved\n        limbs,\nBending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts\n        and braces,\nThe hooked arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,\nThe floor-men forcing the planks close, to be nailed,\nTheir postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,\nThe echoes resounding through the vacant building;\nThe huge store-house carried up in the city, well under way,\nThe six framing men, two in the middle, and two at each end, carefully\n        bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a cross-beam,\nThe crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly\n        laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet from front to rear,\nThe flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels\n        striking the bricks,\nThe bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place, and\n        set with a knock of the trowel-handle,\nThe piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the steady\n        replenishing by the hod-men;\n--Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown apprentices,\nThe swing of their axes on the square-hewed log, shaping it toward the\n        shape of a mast,\nThe brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,\nThe butter-coloured chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,\nThe limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes;\nThe constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats, stays\n        against the sea;\n--The city fireman--the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close-packed\n        square,\nThe arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,\nThe strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line, the rise\n        and fall of the arms forcing the water,\nThe slender, spasmic blue-white jets--the bringing to bear of the hooks and\n        ladders, and their execution,\nThe crash and cut-away of connecting woodwork, or through floors, if the\n        fire smoulders under them,\nThe crowd with their lit faces, watching--the glare and dense shadows;\n--The forger at his forge-furnace, and the user of iron after him,\nThe maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,\nThe chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the edge\n        with his thumb,\nThe one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket;\nThe shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,\nThe primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,\nThe far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,\nThe Roman lictors preceding the consuls,\nThe antique European warrior with his axe in combat,\nThe uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,\nThe death-howl, the limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe\n        thither,\nThe siege of revolted lieges determined for liberty,\nThe summons to surrender, the battering at castle-gates, the truce and\n        parley;\nThe sack of an old city in its time,\nThe bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,\nRoar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,\nGoods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe\n        of brigands,\nCraft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,\nThe hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,\nThe list of all executive deeds and words, just or unjust,\nThe power of personality, just or unjust.\n\n\n4.\n\nMuscle and pluck for ever!\nWhat invigorates life invigorates death,\nAnd the dead advance as much as the living advance,\nAnd the future is no more uncertain than the present,\nAnd the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as\n        much as the _delicatesse_ of the earth and of man,\nAnd nothing endures but personal qualities.\n\nWhat do you think endures?\nDo you think the great city endures?\nOr a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best-\n        built steamships?\nOr hotels of granite and iron? or any _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of engineering,\n        forts, armaments?\n\nAway! These are not to be cherished for themselves;\nThey fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play\n        for them;\nThe show passes, all does well enough of course,\nAll does very well till one flash of defiance.\n\nThe great city is that which has the greatest man or woman;\nIf it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the\n        whole world.\n\n\n5.\n\nThe place where the great city stands is not the place of\n        stretched wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce,\nNor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers, or the\n        anchor-lifters of the departing,\nNor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings, or shops\n        selling goods from the rest of the earth,\nNor the place of the best libraries and schools--nor the place where money\n        is plentiest,\nNor the place of the most numerous population.\n\nWhere the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards;\nWhere the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return,\n        and understands them;\nWhere no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds;\nWhere thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place;\nWhere the men and women think lightly of the laws;\nWhere the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases;\nWhere the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of\n        elected persons;\nWhere fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death\n        pours its sweeping and unripped waves;\nWhere outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside\n        authority;\nWhere the citizen is always the head and ideal--and President, Mayor,\n        Governor, and what not, are agents for pay;\nWhere children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on\n        themselves;\nWhere equanimity is illustrated in affairs;\nWhere speculations on the Soul are encouraged;\nWhere women walk in public processions in the streets, the same as the men;\nWhere they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;\nWhere the city of the faithfullest friends stands;\nWhere the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands;\nWhere the city of the healthiest fathers stands;\nWhere the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,--\nThere the great city stands.\n\n\n6.\n\nHow beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!\nHow the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man's or\n        woman's look!\n\nAll waits, or goes by default, till a strong being appears;\nA strong being is the proof of the race, and of the ability of the\n        universe;\nWhen he or she appears, materials are overawed,\nThe dispute on the Soul stops,\nThe old customs and phrases are confronted, turned back, or laid away.\n\nWhat is your money-making now? What can it do now?\nWhat is your respectability now?\nWhat are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-books, now?\nWhere are your jibes of being now?\nWhere are your cavils about the Soul now?\n\nWas that your best? Were those your vast and solid?\nRiches, opinions, politics, institutions, to part obediently from the path\n        of one man or woman!\nThe centuries, and all authority, to be trod under the foot-soles of one\n        man or woman!\n\n\n7.\n\nA sterile landscape covers the ore--there is as good as the best, for all\n        the forbidding appearance;\nThere is the mine, there are the miners;\nThe forge-furnace is there, the melt is accomplished; the hammersmen are at\n        hand with their tongs and hammers;\nWhat always served and always serves is at hand.\n\nThan this nothing has better served--it has served all:\nServed the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and long ere the Greek;\nServed in building the buildings that last longer than any;\nServed the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindostanee;\nServed the mound-raiser on the Mississippi--served those whose relics\n        remain in Central America;\nServed Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars, and the\n        druids;\nServed the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow-covered hills\n        of Scandinavia;\nServed those who, time out of mind, made on the granite walls rough\n        sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, ocean-waves;\nServed the paths of the irruptions of the Goths--served the pastoral tribes\n        and nomads;\nServed the long long distant Kelt--served the hardy pirates of the Baltic;\nServed, before any of those, the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia;\nServed the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure, and the making of\n        those for war;\nServed all great works on land, and all great works on the sea;\nFor the mediaeval ages, and before the mediaeval ages;\nServed not the living only, then as now, but served the dead.\n\n\n8.\n\nI see the European headsman;\nHe stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked arms,\nAnd leans on a ponderous axe.\n\nWhom have you slaughtered lately, European headsman?\nWhose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?\n\nI see the clear sunsets of the martyrs;\nI see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,\nGhosts of dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected\n        kings,\nRivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest.\n\nI see those who in any land have died for the good cause;\nThe seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out;\n(Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out.)\n\nI see the blood washed entirely away from the axe;\nBoth blade and helve are clean;\nThey spirt no more the blood of European nobles--they clasp no more the\n        necks of queens.\n\nI see the headsman withdraw and become useless;\nI see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy--I see no longer any axe upon it;\nI see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race--the\n        newest, largest race.\n\n\n9.\n\nAmerica!

  bay and by-place,\nThe live-oak kelsons, the pine-planks, the spars, the hackmatack-roots for\n        knees,\nThe ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the workmen\n        busy outside and inside,\nThe tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze, bolt,\n        line, square, gouge, and bead-plane.\n\n\n10.\n\nThe shapes arise!\nThe shape measured, sawed, jacked, joined, stained,\nThe coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud;\nThe shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of the\n        bride's bed;\nThe shape of the

passes--nothing is concealed from her;\nShe is none the less considerate or friendly therefor;\nShe is the best beloved--it is without exception--she has no reason to\n        fear, and she does not fear;\nOaths, quarrels, hiccupped songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as\n        she passes;\nShe is silent--she is possessed of herself--they do not offend her;\nShe receives them as the laws

past ages:\nWith all which, had it not been, I would not now be here, as I am;\nWith Egypt, India, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome;\nWith the Kelt, the Scandinavian, the Alb, and the Saxon;\nWith antique maritime ventures,--with laws, artisanship, wars, and\n        journeys;\nWith the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle;\nWith the sale of slaves--with enthusiasts--with the troubadour, the\n        crusader, and the monk;\nWith those old continents whence we have come to this new continent;\nWith the fading kingdoms and kings over there;\nWith the fading religions and priests;\nWith the small shores we look back to from our own large and present\n        shores;\nWith countless years drawing themselves onward, and arrived at these years;\nYou and Me arrived--America arrived, and making this year;\nThis year! sending itself ahead countless years to come.\n\n\n2.\n\nO but it is not the years--it is I--it is You;\nWe touch all laws, and tally all antecedents;\nWe are the skald, the oracle, the monk, and the knight--we easily include\n        them, and more;\nWe stand amid time, beginningless and endless--we stand amid evil and good;\nAll swings around us--there is as much darkness as light;\nThe very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us:\nIts sun, and its again, all swing around us.\n\n\n3.\n\nAs for me, (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehement days;)\nI have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all;\nI believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is true--I reject no part.\n\nHave I forgotten any part?\nCome to me, whoever and whatever, till I give you recognition.\n\nI respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;\nI adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god;\nI see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without\n        exception;\nI assert that all past days were what they should have been;\nAnd that they could nohow have been better than they were,\nAnd that to-day is what it should be--and that America is,\nAnd that to-day and America could nohow be better than they are.\n\n\n4.\n\nIn the name of these States, and in your and my name, the Past,\nAnd in the name of these States, and in your and my name, the Present time.\n\nI know that the past was great, and the future will be great,\nAnd I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time,\nFor the sake of him I typify--for the common average man's sake--your sake,\n        if you are he;\nAnd that where I am, or you are, this present day, there is the centre of\n        all days, all races,\nAnd there is the meaning, to us, of all that has ever come of races and\n        days, or ever will come.\n\n\n\n_SALUT AU MONDE!_\n\n\n1.\n\nO take my hand, Walt Whitman!\nSuch gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!\nSuch joined unended links, each hooked to the next!\nEach answering all--each sharing the earth with all.\n\nWhat widens within you, Walt Whitman?\nWhat waves and soils exuding?\nWhat climes? what persons and lands are here?\nWho are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?\nWho are the girls? who are the married women?\nWho are the three old men going slowly with their arms about each others'\n        necks?\nWhat rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\nWhat are the mountains called that rise so high in the mists?\nWhat myriads of dwellings are they, filled with dwellers?\n\n\n2.\n\nWithin me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;\nAsia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the west;\nBanding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\nCuriously north and south turn the axis-ends;\nWithin me is the longest day--the sun wheels in slanting rings--it does not\n        set for months.\nStretched in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the\n        horizon, and sinks again;\nWithin me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,\nMalaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\n\n\n3.\n\nWhat do you hear, Walt Whitman?\n\nI hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife singing;\nI hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of animals early in the\n        day;\nI hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and Kentucky,\n        hunting on hills;\nI hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the wild horse;\nI hear the Spanish dance,

Nile;\nI hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams of Canada;\nI hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule;\nI hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque;\nI hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches--I hear the\n        responsive bass and soprano;\nI hear the wail of utter despair of the white-haired Irish grandparents,\n        when they learn the death of their grandson;\nI hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to sea at\n        Okotsk;\nI hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on--as the husky\n        gangs pass on by twos and threes, fastened together with wrist-\n        chains and ankle-chains;\nI hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment--I hear the sibilant\n        whisk of thongs through the air;\nI hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;\nI hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of the\n        Romans;\nI hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful God,\n        the Christ;\nI hear the Hindoo teaching his favourite pupil the loves, wars, adages,\n        transmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote three thousand\n        years ago.\n\n\n4.\n\nWhat do you see, Walt Whitman?\nWho are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?\n\nI see a great round wonder rolling through the air:\nI see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails, factories,\n        palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads, upon the\n        surface;\nI see the shaded part on one side, where the sleepers are sleeping--and the\n        sun-lit part on the other side;\nI see the curious silent change of the light and shade;\nI see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them as my land\n        is to me.\n\nI see plenteous waters;\nI see mountain-peaks--I see the sierras of Andes and Alleghanies, where\n        they range;\nI see plainly the Himalayas,

Hindostan, the China Sea, and the Gulf of\n        Guinea,\nThe spread of the Baltic, Caspian, Bothnia, the British shores, and the Bay\n        of Biscay,\nThe clear-sunned Mediterranean, and from one to another of its islands,\nThe inland fresh-tasted seas of North America,\nThe White Sea, and the sea around Greenland.\nI behold the mariners of the world;\nSome are in storms--some in the night, with the watch on the look-out;\nSome drifting helplessly--some with contagious diseases.\n\nI behold the sail and steam ships of the world, some in clusters in port,\n        some on their voyages;\nSome double the Cape of Storms--some Cape Verde,--others Cape Guardafui,\n        Bon, or Bajadore;\nOthers Dondra Head--others pass the Straits of Sunda--others Cape Lopatka--\n

boats separate--they diverge and row off, each on its rounding course\n        to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;\nThe net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,\nSome of the fishermen lounge in their boats--others stand negligently\n        ankle-deep in the water, poised on strong legs;\nThe boats are partly drawn up--the water slaps against them;\nOn the sand, in heaps

What is all this chattering of bare\n        gums?\nDoes the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for\n        firelocks, and level them?\n\nIf you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's\n        marshal;\nIf you groan such groans, you might baulk the government cannon.\n\nFor shame, old maniacs!

Look from the windows, women!\n\nThe committee open the box; set up the regal ribs; glue those that will not\n        stay;\nClap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.\n\nYou have got your revenge, old bluster!

Manhattan arming.\n\n\n3.\n\nTo the drum-taps prompt,\nThe young men falling in and arming;\nThe mechanics arming, the trowel, the jack-plane, the black-smith's hammer,\n        tossed aside with precipitation;\nThe lawyer leaving his office, and arming--the judge leaving the court;\nThe driver deserting his waggon in the street, jumping down, throwing the\n        reins abruptly down on the horses' backs;\nThe salesman leaving the store--the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;\nSquads gathering everywhere by common consent, and arming;\nThe new recruits, even boys--the old men show them how to wear their\n        accoutrements--they buckle the straps carefully;\nOutdoors arming--indoors arming--the flash of the musket-barrels;\nThe white tents cluster in camps--the armed sentries around--the sunrise\n        cannon, and again at sunset;\nArmed regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark from\n        the wharves;\nHow good they look, as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their\n        guns on their shoulders!\nHow I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces, and their\n        clothes and knapsacks covered with dust!\nThe blood of the city up--armed! armed! the cry everywhere;\nThe flags flung out from the steeples of churches, and from all the public\n        buildings and stores;\nThe tearful parting--the mother kisses her son--the son kisses his mother;\nLoth is the mother to part--yet not a word does she speak to detain him;\nThe tumultuous escort--the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way;\nThe unpent enthusiasm--the wild cheers of the crowd for their favourites;\nThe artillery--the silent cannons, bright as gold, drawn along, rumble\n        lightly over the stones;\nSilent cannons--soon to cease your silence,\nSoon, unlimbered, to begin the red business!\nAll the mutter of preparation--all the determined arming;\nThe hospital service--the lint, bandages, and medicines;\nThe women volunteering for nurses--the work begun for, in earnest--no mere\n        parade now;\nWar! an armed race is advancing!--the welcome for battle--no turning away;\nWar! be it weeks, months, or years--an armed race is advancing to welcome\n        it.\n\n\n4.\n\nMannahatta a-march!--and it's O to sing it well!\nIt's O for a manly life in the camp!\n\n\n5.\n\nAnd the sturdy artillery!\nThe guns, bright as gold--the work for giants--to serve well the guns:\nUnlimber them! no more, as the past forty years, for salutes for courtesies\nmerely;\nPut in something else now besides powder and wadding.\n\n\n6.\n\nAnd you, Lady of Ships! you, Mannahatta!\nOld matron of the city! this proud, friendly, turbulent city!\nOften in peace and wealth you were pensive, or covertly frowned amid all\nyour children;\nBut now you smile with joy, exulting old Mannahatta!\n\n\n\n_1861._\n\nArmed year! year of the struggle!\nNo dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year!\nNot you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas piano;\nBut as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a\n        rifle on your shoulder,\nWith well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands--with a knife in the\n        belt at your side,\nAs I heard you shouting loud--your sonorous voice ringing across the\n        continent;\nYour masculine voice, O year, as rising amid the great cities,\nAmid the men of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the dwellers in\n        Manhattan;\nOr with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,\nRapidly crossing the West with springy gait, and descending the\n        Alleghanies;\nOr down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the Ohio\n        river;\nOr southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chattanooga on\n        the mountain-top,\nSaw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing\n        weapons, robust year;\nHeard your determined voice, launched forth again and again;\nYear that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipped cannon,\nI repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.\n\n\n\n_THE UPRISING._\n\n\n1.\n\nRise, O days, from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier and fiercer\n        sweep!\nLong for my soul, hungering gymnastic, I devoured what the earth gave me;\nLong I roamed the woods of the North--long I watched Niagara pouring;\nI travelled the prairies over, and slept on their breast--I crossed the\n        Nevadas,\nI crossed the plateaus;\nI ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sailed out to sea;\nI sailed through the storm, I was refreshed by the storm;\nI watched with joy the threatening maws of the waves;\nI marked the white combs where they careered so high, curling over;\nI heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds;\nSaw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my heart, and\n        powerful!)\nHeard the continuous thunder, as it bellowed after the lightning;\nNoted the slender and jagged threads of lightning, as sudden and fast amid\n        the din they chased each other across the sky;\n--These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive and\n        masterful;\nAll the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me;\nYet there with my soul I fed--I fed content, supercilious.\n\n\n2.\n\n'Twas well, O soul! 'twas a good preparation you gave me!\nNow we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill;\nNow we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us;\nNot through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities;\nSomething for us is pouring now, more than Niagara pouring;\nTorrents of men, (sources and rills of the North-west, are you indeed\n        inexhaustible?)\nWhat, to pavements and homesteads here--what were those storms of the\n        mountains and sea?\nWhat, to passions I witness around me to-day, was the sea risen?\nWas the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?\n\nLo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage;\nManhattan, rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,\n        unchained;\n--What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here!\nHow it climbs with daring feet and hands! how it dashes!\nHow the true thunder bellows after the lightning! how bright the flashes of\n        lightning!\nHow DEMOCRACY with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the\n        dark by those flashes of lightning!\nYet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,\nIn a lull of the deafening confusion.\n\n\n3.\n\nThunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!\nAnd do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!\nCrash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good;\nMy soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong nutriment.\nLong had I walked my cities, my country roads, through farms, only half\n        satisfied;\nOne doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawled on the ground before\n        me,\nContinually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing\n        low;\n--The cities I loved so well I abandoned and left--I sped to the\n        certainties suitable to me\nHungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies, and Nature's\n        dauntlessness,\nI refreshed myself with it only, I could relish it only;\nI waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I waited\n        long.\n--But now I no longer wait--I am fully satisfied--I am glutted;\nI have witnessed the true lightning--I have witnessed my cities electric;\nI have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike America rise;\nHence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,\nNo more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea.\n\n\n\n\n_BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!_\n\n\n1.\n\nBeat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!\nThrough the windows--through doors--burst like a force of ruthless men,\nInto the solemn church, and scatter the congregation;\nInto the school where the scholar is studying:\nLeave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with his\n        bride;\nNor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his\n        grain;\nSo fierce you whirr and pound, you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.\n\n\n2.\n\nBeat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!\nOver the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets:\nAre beds prepared, for sleepers at night in the houses? No sleepers must\n        sleep in those beds;\nNo bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--Would they\n        continue?\nWould the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?\nWould the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?\nThen rattle quicker, heavier, drums--you bugles wilder blow.\n\n\n3.\n\nBeat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!\nMake no parley--stop for no expostulation;\nMind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer;\nMind not the old man beseeching the young man;\nLet not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties;\nMake even the trestles to shake the dead, where they lie awaiting the\n        hearses,\nSo strong you thump, O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.\n\n\n\n_SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK._\n\n\nPOET.\n\n\nO a new song, a free song,\nFlapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,\nBy the wind's voice and that of the drum,\nBy the banner's voice, and child's voice, and sea's voice, and father's\n        voice,\nLow on the ground and high in the air,\nOn the ground where father and child stand,\nIn the upward air where their eyes turn,\nWhere the banner at daybreak is flapping.\n\nWords! book-words! what are you?\nWords no more, for hearken and see,\nMy song is there in the open air--and I must sing,\nWith the banner and pennant a-flapping.\n\nI'll weave the chord and twine in,\nMan's desire and babe's desire--I'll twine them in, I'll put in life;\nI'll put the bayonet's flashing point--I'll let bullets and slugs whizz;\nI'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy;\nThen loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,\nWith the banner and pennant a-flapping.\n\n\n\nBANNER AND PENNANT.\n\n\nCome up here, bard, bard;\nCome up here, soul, soul;\nCome up here, dear little child,\nTo fly in the clouds and winds with us, and play with the measureless\n        light.\n\n\nCHILD.\n\nFather, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?\nAnd what does it say to me all the while?\n\n\nFATHER.\n\nNothing, my babe, you see in the sky;\nAnd nothing at all to you it says. But look you, my babe,\nLook at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-shops\n        opening;\nAnd see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods:\nThese! ah, these! how valued and toiled for, these!\nHow envied by all the earth!\n\n\nPOET.\n\nFresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high;\nOn floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its channels;\nOn floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in toward land;\nThe great steady wind from west and west-by-south,\nFloating so buoyant, with milk-white foam on the waters.\n\nBut I am not the sea, nor the red sun;\nI am not the wind, with girlish laughter;\nNot the immense wind which strengthens--not the wind which lashes;\nNot the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death:\nBut I am of that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,\nWhich babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land;\nWhich the birds know in the woods, mornings and evenings,\nAnd the shore-sands know, and the hissing wave, and that banner and\n        pennant,\nAloft there flapping and flapping.\n\n\nCHILD.\n\nO father, it is alive--it is full of people--it has children!\nO now it seems to me it is talking to its children!\nI hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!\nO it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast! O my father,\nIt is so broad it covers the whole sky!\n\n\nFATHER.\n\nCease, cease, my foolish babe,\nWhat you are saying is sorrowful to me--much it displeases me;\nBehold with the rest, again I say--behold not banners and pennants aloft;\nBut the well-prepared pavements behold--and mark the solid-walled houses.\n\n\nBANNER AND PENNANT.\n\nSpeak to the child, O bard, out of Manhattan;\nSpeak to our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,\nWhere our factory-engines hum, where our miners delve the ground,\nWhere our hoarse Niagara rumbles, where our prairie-ploughs are ploughing;\nSpeak, O bard! point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and\n        yet we know not why;\nFor what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,\nOnly flapping in the wind?\n\n\nPOET.\n\nI hear and see not strips of cloth alone;\nI hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry;\nI hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men--I hear LIBERTY!\nI hear the drums beat, and the trumpets blowing;\nI myself move abroad, swift-rising, flying then;\nI use the wings of the land-bird, and use the wings of the sea-bird, and\n        look down as from a height.\nI do not deny the precious results of peace--I see populous cities, with\n        wealth incalculable;\nI see numberless farms--I see the farmers working in their fields or barns;\nI see mechanics working--I see buildings everywhere founded, going up, or\n        finished;\nI see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks, drawn by the\n        locomotives;\nI see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans;\nI see far in the west the immense area of grain--I dwell a while, hovering;\nI pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to the southern\n        plantation, and again to California;\nSweeping the whole, I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, earned\n        wages;\nSee the identity formed out of thirty-six spacious and haughty States, (and\n        many more to come;)\nSee forts on the shores of harbours--see ships sailing in and out;\nThen over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthened pennant shaped like a\n        sword\nRuns swiftly up, indicating war and defiance--And now the halyards have\n        raised it,\nSide of my banner broad and blue--side of my starry banner,\nDiscarding peace over all the sea and land.\n\n\nBANNER AND PENNANT.\n\nYet louder, higher, stronger, bard!

in life and death supreme,\nWe, even we, from this day flaunt out masterful, high up above,\nNot for the present alone, for a thousand years, chanting through you\nThis song to the soul of one poor little child.\n\n\nCHILD.\n\nO my father, I like not the houses;\nThey will never to me be anything--nor do I like money!\nBut to mount up there I would like, O father dear--that banner I like;\nThat pennant I would be, and must be.\n\n\nFATHER.\n\nChild of mine, you fill me with anguish,\nTo be that pennant would be too fearful;\nLittle you know what it is this day, and henceforth for ever;\nIt is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything;\nForward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you to do\n        with them?\nWith passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?\n\n\nPOET.\n\nDemons and death then I sing;\nPut in all, aye all, will I--sword-shaped pennant for war, and banner so\n        broad and blue,\nAnd a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,\nBlent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the liquid wash of the sea;\nAnd the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines;\nAnd the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the hot sun\n        shining south;\nAnd the beach-waves combing over the beach on my eastern shore, and my\n        western shore the same;\nAnd all between those shores, and my ever-running Mississippi, with bends\n        and chutes;\nAnd my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of Missouri;\nThe CONTINENT--devoting the whole identity, without reserving an atom,\nPour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all, and the yield of\n        all.\n\n\nBANNER AND PENNANT.\n\nAye all! for ever, for all!\nFrom sea to sea, north and south, east and west,\nFusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole;\nNo more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,\nBut out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,\nCroaking like crows here in the wind.\n\n\nPOET.\n\nMy limbs, my veins dilate;\nThe blood of the world has filled me full--my theme is clear at last.\n--Banner so broad, advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and\n        resolute;\nI burst through where I waited long, too long, deafened and blinded;\nMy sight, my hearing and tongue, are come to me, (a little child taught\n        me;)\nI hear from above, O pennant of war, your ironical call and demand;\nInsensate! insensate! yet I at any rate chant you, O banner!\nNot houses of peace are you, nor any nor all their prosperity; if need be,\nyou shall have every one of those houses to destroy them;\nYou thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full of\n        comfort, built with money;\nMay they stand fast, then? Not an hour, unless you, above them and all,\n        stand fast.\n--O banner! not money so precious are you, nor farm produce you, nor the\n        material good nutriment,\nNor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships;\nNot the superb ships, with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and carrying\n        cargoes,\nNor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,--But you, as henceforth I see\n        you,\nRunning up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, ever-enlarging\n        stars;\nDivider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touched by the sun, measuring the\n        sky,\nPassionately seen and yearned for by one poor little child,\nWhile others remain busy, or smartly talking, for ever teaching thrift,\n        thrift;\nO you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake, hissing so\n        curious,\nOut of reach--an idea only--yet furiously fought for, risking bloody\n        death--loved by me!\nSo loved! O you banner, leading the day, with stars brought from the night!\nValueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--O banner and\n        pennant!\nI too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines are\n        nothing--I see them not;\nI see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I sing\n        you only,\nFlapping up there in the wind.\n\n\n\n_THE BIVOUAC'S FLAME._\n\n\nBy the bivouac's fitful flame,\nA procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow;--but first I\n        note\nThe tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim outline,\nThe darkness, lit by spots of kindled fire--the silence;\nLike a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving;\nThe shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily\n        watching me;)\nWhile wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,\nOf life and death--of home and the past and loved, and of those that are\n        far away;\nA solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,\nBy the bivouac's fitful flame.\n\n\n\n_BIVOUAC ON A MOUNTAIN-SIDE._\n\n\nI see before me now a travelling army halting;\nBelow, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of summer;\nBehind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising high;\nBroken with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily seen;\nThe numerous camp-fires scattered near and far, some away up on the\n        mountain;\nThe shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering;\nAnd over all, the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded with the\n        eternal stars.\n\n\n\n_CITY OF SHIPS._\n\n\nCity of ships!\n(O the black ships!

Yet this sign left\nOn a tablet scrawled and nailed on the tree by the grave,\n_Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade_.\n\n\n2.\n\nLong, long I muse,--then on my way go wandering,\nMany a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life.\nYet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt,--alone, or in the\n        crowded street,--\nComes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription rude in\n        Virginia's woods,\n_Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade_.\n\n\n\n_THE DRESSER._\n\n\n1.\n\nAn old man bending, I come among new faces,\nYears, looking backward, resuming, in answer to children,\n\"Come tell us, old man,\" (as from young men and maidens that love me, Years\n        hence) \"of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,\nOf unsurpassed heroes--(was one side so brave? the other was equally brave)\nNow be witness again--paint the mightiest armies of earth;\nOf those armies, so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?\nWhat stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,\nOf hard-fought engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest remains?\"\n\n\n2.\n\nO maidens and young men I love, and that love me,\nWhat you ask of my days, those the strangest and sudden your talking\n        recalls,\nSoldier alert I arrive, after a long march, covered with sweat and dust;\nIn the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush\n        of successful charge;\nEnter the captured works,...yet lo! like a swift-running river, they fade,\nPass, and are gone; they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or soldiers'\n        joys;\n(Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was\n        content.)\n\nBut in silence, in dreams' projections,\nWhile the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,\nSo soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,\nIn nature's reverie sad, with hinged knees returning, I enter the\n        doors--(while for you up there, Whoever you are, follow me without\n        noise, and be of strong heart.)\nBearing the bandages, water, and sponge,\nStraight and swift to my wounded I go,\nWhere they lie on the ground, after the battle brought in;\nWhere their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground;\nOr to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roofed hospital;\nTo the long rows of cots, up and down, each side, I return;\nTo each and all, one after another, I draw near--not one do I miss;\nAn attendant follows, holding a tray--he carries a refuse-pail,\nSoon to be filled with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and filled again.\n\nI onward go, I stop,\nWith hinged knees and steady hand, to dress wounds;\nI am firm with each--the pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable;\nOne turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy!

snap!\nI hear the sound of the different missiles--the short _t-h-t! t-h-t!_ of\n        the rifle-balls;\nI see the shells exploding, leaving small white clouds--I hear the great\n        shells shrieking as they pass;\nThe grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, (quick,\n        tumultuous, now the contest rages!)\nAll the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again;\nThe crashing and smoking--the pride of the men in their pieces;\nThe chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of the\n        right time;\nAfter firing, I see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the\n        effect;\n--Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging--the young colonel leads\n        himself this time, with brandished sword;\nI see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, quickly filled up--no delay;\nI breathe the suffocating smoke--then the flat clouds hover low, concealing\n        all;\nNow a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either\n        side;\nThen resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of\n        officers;\nWhile from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout\n        of applause, (some special success;)\nAnd ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in dreams, a\n        devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my\n        soul;\nAnd ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions--batteries, cavalry,\n        moving hither and thither;\nThe falling, dying, I heed not--the wounded, dripping and red, I heed not--\n        some to the rear are hobbling;\nGrime, heat, rush--aides-de-camp galloping by, or on a full run:\nWith the patter of small arms, the warning _s-s-t_ of the rifles, (these in\n        my vision I hear or see,)\nAnd bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-coloured rockets.\n\n\n\n_O TAN-FACED PRAIRIE BOY._\n\n\nO tan-faced prairie boy!\nBefore you came to camp came many a welcome gift;\nPraises and presents came, and nourishing food--till at last, among the\n        recruits,\nYou came, taciturn, with nothing to give--we but looked on each other,\nWhen lo!

My handsome, tan-faced horsemen!\n        what life, what joy and pride, With all the perils, were yours!)\n\nNor you drummers--neither at _reveillé_, at dawn,\nNor the long roll alarming the camp--nor even the muffled beat for a\n        burial;\nNothing from you, this time, O drummers, bearing my warlike drums.\n\n\n3.\n\nBut aside from these, and the crowd's hurrahs, and the land's\n        congratulations,\nAdmitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless,\nI chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers.\n\n\n4.\n\nFaces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet;\nDraw close, but speak not.\nPhantoms, welcome, divine and tender!\nInvisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions;\nFollow me ever! desert me not, while I live!\n\nSweet are the blooming cheeks of the living, sweet are the musical voices\n        sounding;\nBut sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.\n\nDearest comrades! all now is over;\nBut love is not over--and what love, O comrades!\nPerfume from battlefields rising--up from foetor arising.\n\nPerfume therefore my chant, O love! immortal love!\nGive me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers.\n\nPerfume all! make all wholesome!\nO love! O chant! solve all with the last chemistry.\n\nGive me exhaustless--make me a fountain,\nThat I exhale love from me wherever I go,\nFor the sake of all dead soldiers.\n\n\n\n_SPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE._\n\n\nSpirit whose work is done! spirit of dreadful hours!\nEre, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets--\nSpirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, yet onward ever unfaltering pressing!\nSpirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene! Electric spirit!\nThat with muttering voice, through the years now closed, like a tireless\n        phantom flitted,\nRousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the drum;\n--Now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last, reverberates\n        round me;\nAs your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles;\nWhile the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders;\nWhile I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders;\nWhile those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, appearing in the\n        distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,\nMoving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the right and left,\nEvenly, lightly, rising and falling, as the steps keep time:\n--Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next\n        day;\nTouch my mouth, ere you depart--press my lips close!\nLeave me your pulses of rage! bequeath them to me! fill me with currents\n        convulsive!\nLet them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you are gone;\nLet them identify you to the future in these songs!\n\n\n\n_RECONCILIATION._\n\n\nWord over all, beautiful as the sky!\nBeautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly\n        lost;\nThat the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly, softly wash\n        again, and ever again, this soiled world.\nFor my enemy is dead--a man divine as myself is dead.\nI look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin--I draw near;\nI bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.\n\n\n\n_AFTER THE WAR._\n\n\nTo the leavened soil they trod, calling, I sing, for the last;\nNot cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead:\nBut forth from my tent emerging for good--loosing, untying the tent-ropes;\nIn the freshness, the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits and\n        vistas, again to peace restored;\nTo the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas beyond--to the south\n        and the north;\nTo the leavened soil of the general Western World, to attest my songs,\nTo the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of war and peace,\nTo the Alleghanian hills, and the tireless Mississippi,\nTo the rocks I, calling, sing, and all the trees in the woods,\nTo the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie spreading wide,\nTo the far-off sea, and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air.\nAnd responding they answer all, (but not in words,)\nThe average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely;\nThe prairie draws me close, as the father, to bosom broad, the son:--\nThe Northern ice and rain, that began me, nourish me to the end;\nBut the hot sun of the South is to ripen my songs.\n\n\n\nWALT WHITMAN\n\n\n\n_ASSIMILATIONS._\n\n\n1.\n\nThere was a child went forth every day;\nAnd the first object he looked upon, that object he became;\nAnd that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the\n        day, or for many years, or tretching cycles of years.\n\n\n2.\n\nThe early lilacs became part of this child,\nAnd grass, and white and red morning-glories,[1] and white and red clover,\n        and the song of the phoebe-bird,[2]\nAnd the Third-month lambs, and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the mare's\n        foal, and the cow's calf,\nAnd the noisy brood of the barn-yard, or by the mire of the pond-side,\nAnd the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there--and the\n        beautiful, curious liquid,\nAnd the water-plants with their graceful fiat heads--all became part of\n        him.\nThe field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part or him;\n\n\n3.\nWinter-grain sprouts, and those of the light-yellow corn, and the esculent\n        roots of the garden,\nAnd the apple-trees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, and\n        wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road;\nAnd the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern,\n        whence he had lately risen,\nAnd the schoolmistress that passed on her way to the school,\nAnd the friendly boys that passed, and the quarrelsome boys,\nAnd the tidy and fresh-cheeked girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,\nAnd all the changes of city and country, wherever he went.\n\nHis own parents;\nHe that had fathered him, and she that had conceived him in her womb, and\n        birthed him,\nThey gave this child more of themselves than that;\nThey gave him afterward every day--they became part of him.\nThe mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table;\nThe mother with mild words--clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odour\n        falling off her person and clothes as she walks by;\nThe father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust;\nThe blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,\nThe family usages, the language, the company, the furniture--the yearning\n        and swelling heart,\nAffection that will not be gainsaid--the sense of what is real--the thought\n        if after all it should prove unreal,\nThe doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time--the curious whether\n        and how--\nWhether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?\nMen and women crowding fast in the streets--if they are not flashes and\n        specks, what are they?\nThe streets themselves, and the façades of houses, and goods in the\n        windows,\nVehicles, teams, the heavy-planked wharves--the huge crossing at the\n        ferries,\nThe village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset--the river between;\nShadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs and gables of white or\n        brown, three miles off;\nThe schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide--the little boat\n        slack-towed astern,\nThe hurrying tumbling waves quick-broken crests slapping,\nThe strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint, away solitary\n        by itself-the spread of purity it lies motionless in,\nThe horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and\n        shore mud;--\nThese became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes,\n        and will always go forth every day.\n\n[Footnote 1: The name of \"morning-glory\" is given to the bindweed, or a\nsort of bindweed, in America. I am not certain whether this expressive name\nis used in England also.]\n\n[Footnote 2: A dun-coloured little bird with a cheerful note, sounding like\nthe word Phoebe.]\n\n\n\n_A WORD OUT OF THE SEA._\n\n\n1.\n\nOut of the rocked cradle,\nOut of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,\nOut of the Ninth-month midnight,\nOver the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child, leaving his\n        bed, wandered alone, bareheaded, barefoot,\nDown from the showered halo,\nUp from the mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting; as if they were\n        alive,\nOut from the patches of briars and blackberries,\nFrom the memories of the birds that chanted to me,\nFrom your memories, sad brother--from the fitful risings and fallings I\n        heard,\nFrom under that yellow half-moon, late-risen, and swollen as if with tears,\nFrom those beginning notes of sickness and love, there in the transparent\n        mist,\nFrom the thousand responses of my heart, never to cease,\nFrom the myriad thence-aroused words,\nFrom the word stronger and more delicious than any,--\nFrom such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,\nAs a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,\nBorne hither--ere all eludes me, hurriedly,--\nA man--yet by these tears a little boy again,\nThrowing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,\nI, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,\nTaking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond\n        them,\nA reminiscence sing.\n\n\n2.\n\nOnce, Paumanok,\nWhen the snows had melted, and the Fifth-month grass\n        was growing,\nUp this sea-shore, in some briars,\nTwo guests from Alabama--two together,\nAnd their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown;\nAnd every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,\nAnd every day the she-bird, crouched on her nest, silent,\n        with bright eyes;\nAnd every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never\n        disturbing them,\nCautiously peering, absorbing, translating.\n\n\n3.\n\n_Shine! shine! shine!\nPour down your warmth, great Sun!\nWhile we bask--we two together.\n\nTwo together!\nWinds blow South, or winds blow North,\nDay come white or night come black,\nHome, or rivers and mountains from home,\nSinging all time, minding no time,\nIf we two but keep together_.\n\n\n4.\n\nTill of a sudden,\nMaybe killed, unknown to her mate,\nOne forenoon the she-bird crouched not on the nest,\nNor returned that afternoon, nor the next,\nNor ever appeared again.\n\nAnd thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,\nAnd at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather,\nOver the hoarse surging of the sea,\nOr flitting from briar to briar by day,\nI saw, I heard at intervals, the remaining one, the he-bird,\nThe solitary guest from Alabama.\n\n\n5.\n\n\n_Blow! blow! blow!\nBlow up, sea-winds, along Paumanok's shore!\nI wait and I wait, till you blow my mate to me_.\n\n\n6.\n\nYes, when the stars glistened.\nAll night long, on the prong of a moss-scalloped stake,\nDown, almost amid the slapping waves,\nSat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears.\n\nHe called on his mate;\nHe poured forth the meanings which I, of all men, know.\nYes, my brother, I know;\nThe rest might not--but I have treasured every note;\nFor once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding,\nSilent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,\nRecalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after\n        their sorts,\nThe white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,\nI, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,\nListened long and long.\n\nListened, to keep, to sing--now translating the notes,\nFollowing you, my brother.\n\n\n7.\n\n_Soothe! soothe! soothe!\nClose on its wave soothes the wave behind,\nAnd again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,--\nBut my love soothes not me, not me.\n\nLow hangs the moon--it rose late;\nO it is lagging--O I think it is heavy with love, with love.\n\nO madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,\nWith love--with love.\nO night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among the breakers?\nWhat is that little black thing I see there in the white?\n\nLoud! loud! loud!\nLoud. I call to you, my love!\nHigh and clear I shoot my voice over the waves;\nSurely you must know who is here, is here;\nYou must know who I am, my love.\n\nLow-hanging moon!\nWhat is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?\nO it is the shape, the shape of my mate!\nO moon, do not keep her from me any longer!\n\nLand! land! O land!\nWhichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if\n        you only would;\nFor I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.\n\nO rising stars!\nPerhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.\n\nO throat! O trembling throat!\nSound clearer through the atmosphere!\nPierce the woods, the earth;\nSomewhere, listening to catch you, must be the one I want.\n\nShake out, carols!\nSolitary here--the night's carols!\nCarols of lonesome love! Death's carols!\nCarols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!\nO, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea!\nO reckless, despairing carols!\n\nBut soft! sink low;\nSoft! let me just murmur;\nAnd do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;\nFor somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,\nSo faint--I must be still, be still to listen;\nBut not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.\n\nHither, my love!\nHere I am! Here!\nWith this just-sustained note I announce myself to you;\nThis gentle call is for you, my love, for you!\n\nDo not be decoyed elsewhere!\nThat is the whistle of the wind--it is not my voice;\nThat is the fluttering, the flattering of the spray;\nThose are the shadows of leaves.\n\nO darkness! O in vain!\nO I am very sick and sorrowful!\n\nO brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea!\nO troubled reflection in the sea!\nO throat! O throbbing heart!\nO all!--and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.!\n\nYet I murmur, murmur on!\nO murmurs--you yourselves make me continue to sing, I know not why.\n\nO past! O life! O songs of joy!\nIn the air--in the woods--over fields;\nLoved! loved! loved! loved! loved!\nBut my love no more, no more with me!\nWe two together no more_!\n\n\n8.\n\nThe aria sinking;\nAll else continuing--the stars shining,\nThe winds blowing--the notes of the bird continuous echoing,\nWith angry moans the fierce old Mother incessantly moaning,\nOn the sands of Paumanok's shore, grey and rustling;\nThe yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea\n        almost touching;\nThe boy ecstatic--with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the\n        atmosphere, dallying,\nThe love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously\n        bursting;\nThe aria's meaning the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,\nThe strange tears down the cheeks coursing;\nThe colloquy there--the trio--each uttering;\nThe undertone--the savage old Mother, incessantly crying,\nTo the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing--some drowned secret hissing\nTo the outsetting bard of love.\n\n\n9.\n\nDemon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)\nIs it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me?\nFor I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping,\nNow I have heard you,\nNow in a moment I know what I am for--I awake;\nAnd already a thousand singers--a thousand songs, clearer, louder, and more\n        sorrowful than yours,\nA thousand warbling echoes, have started to life within me,\nNever to die.\n\nO you singer, solitary, singing by yourself--projecting me;\nO solitary me, listening--never more shall I cease perpetuating you;\nNever more shall I escape, never more, the reverberations,\nNever more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,\nNever again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there, in\n        the night,\nBy the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,\nThe messenger there aroused--the fire, the sweet hell within,\nThe unknown want, the destiny of me.\n\nO give me the clue! (it lurks in the night here somewhere;)\nO if I am to have so much, let me have more!\nO a word! O what is my destination? I fear it is henceforth chaos;--\nO how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes and all shapes, spring as\n        from graves around me!\n\nO phantoms! you cover all the land, and all the sea!\nO I cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me;\nO vapour, a look, a word! O well-beloved!\nO you dear women's and men's phantoms!\n\nA word then, (for I will conquer it,)\nThe word final, superior to all,\nSubtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;\nAre you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?\nIs that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?\n\n\n10.\n\nWhereto answering, the Sea,\nDelaying not, hurrying not,\nWhispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,\nLisped to me the low and delicious word DEATH;\nAnd again Death--ever Death, Death, Death,\nHissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my aroused child's heart,\nBut edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,\nCreeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over,\nDeath, Death, Death, Death, Death.\n\nWhich I do not forget,\nBut fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,\nThat he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's grey beach,\nWith the thousand responsive songs, at random,\nMy own songs, awaked from that hour;\nAnd with them the key, the word up from the waves,\nThe word of the sweetest song, and all songs,\nThat strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,\nThe Sea whispered me.\n\n\n\n_CROSSING BROOKLYN FERRY._\n\n\n1.\n\nFlood-tide below me! I watch you face to face;\nClouds of the west! sun there half an hour high! I see you also face to\n        face.\n\n\n2.\n\nCrowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are\n        to me!\nOn the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home,\n        are more curious to me than you suppose;\nAnd you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me,\n        and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\n\n\n3.\n\nThe impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the day;\nThe simple, compact, well-joined scheme--myself disintegrated, every one\n        disintegrated, yet part of the scheme;\nThe similitudes of the past, and those of the future;\nThe glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings--on the\n        walk in the street, and the passage over the river;\nThe current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away;\nThe others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them;\nThe certainty of others--the life, love, sight, hearing, of others.\n\nOthers will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore;\nOthers will watch the run of the flood-tide;\nOthers will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights\n        of Brooklyn to the south and east;\nOthers will see the islands large and small;\nFifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour\n        high;\nA hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see\n        them,\nWill enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back\n        to the sea of the ebb-tide.\nIt avails not, neither time nor place--distance avails not;\nI am with you--you men and women of a generation, or ever so many\n        generations hence;\nI project myself--also I return--I am with you, and know how it is.\n\nJust as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt;\nJust as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd;\nJust as you are refreshed by the gladness of the river and the bright flow,\nI was refreshed;\nJust as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I\n        stood, yet was hurried;\nJust as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the\n        thick-stemmed pipes of steamboats, I looked.\n\nI too many and many a time crossed the river, the sun half an hour high;\nI watched the twelfth-month sea-gulls--I saw them high in the air, floating\n        with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\nI saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and left the\n         rest in strong shadow,\nI saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the south.\n\nI too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\nHad my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\nLooked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head\n        in the sun-lit water,\nLooked on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,\nLooked on the vapour as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\nLooked toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,\nSaw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\nSaw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\nThe sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars.\nThe round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine\n        pennants,\nThe large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their\n        pilot-houses,\nThe white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the\n        wheels,\nThe flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\nThe scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome\n        crests and glistening,\nThe stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the grey walls of the granite\n        store-houses by the docks,\nOn the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flanked on each\n        side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\nOn the neighbouring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high\n        and glaringly into the night,\nCasting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light,\n        over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets.\n\nThese, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you;\nI project myself a moment to tell you--also I return.\n\nI loved well those cities;\nI loved well the stately and rapid river;\nThe men and women I saw were all near to me;\nOthers the same--others who look back on me because I looked forward to\n        them;\nThe time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.\n\nWhat is it, then, between us?\nWhat is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\nWhatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not.\n\nI too lived--Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine;\nI too walked the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the waters\n        around it;\nI too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me;\nIn the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,\nIn my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my bed, they came upon me.\n\nI too had been struck from the float for ever held in solution, I too had\n        received identity by my Body;\nThat I was, I knew, was of my body--and what I should be, I knew, I should\n        be of my body.\n\nIt is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\nThe dark threw patches down upon me also;\nThe best I had done seemed to me blank and suspicious;\nMy great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\n        would not people laugh at me?\n\nIt is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;\nI am he who knew what it was to be evil;\nI too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\nBlabbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged;\nHad guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak;\nWas wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant;\nThe wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me;\nThe cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting;\nRefusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting.\n\nBut I was Manhattanese, friendly and proud!\nI was called by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they\n        saw me approaching or passing,\nFelt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their\n        flesh against me as I sat;\nSaw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly, yet\n        never told them a word;\nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,\n        sleeping;\nPlayed the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\nThe same old rôle, the rôle that is what we make it,--as great as we like,\nOr as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\nCloser yet I approach you:\nWhat thought you have of me, I had as much of you--\nI laid in my stores in advance;\nI considered long and seriously of you before you were born.\n\nWho was to know what should come home to me?\nWho knows but I am enjoying this?\nWho knows but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see\n        me?\n\nIt is not you alone, nor I alone;\nNot a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;\nIt is that each came or comes or shall come from its due\nemission, without fail, either now or then or henceforth.\n\nEverything indicates--the smallest does, and the largest does;\nA necessary film envelops all, and envelops the Soul for a proper time.\n\nNow I am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to me\n        than my mast-hemmed Manhatta,\nMy river and sunset, and my scallop-edged waves of flood-tide;\nThe sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and\n        the belated lighter;\nCurious what Gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with\n        voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I\n        approach;\nCurious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man\n        that looks in my face,\nWhich fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you.\n\nWe understand, then, do we not?\nWhat I promised without mentioning it have you not accepted?\nWhat the study could not teach--what the preaching could not accomplish, is\n        accomplished, is it not?\nWhat the push of reading could not start, is started by me personally, is\n        it not?\n\n\n4.\n\nFlow on river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\nFrolic on, crested and scallop-edged waves!\nGorgeous clouds of the sunset, drench with your splendour me, or the men\n        and women generations after me!\nCross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\nStand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!-stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\nBully for you! you proud, friendly, free Manhattanese!\nThrob, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\nSuspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\n\nBlab, blush, lie, steal, you or I or any one after us!\nGaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public\n        assembly!\nSound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest\n        name!\nLive, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\nPlay the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one makes\n        it!\nConsider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking\n        upon you:\nBe firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste\n        with the hasting current;\nFly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\nReceive the summer sky, you water! and faithfully hold it, till all\n        downcast eyes have time to take it from you;\nDiverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one's\n        head, in the sun-lit water;\nCome on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sailed schooners,\n        sloops, lighters!\nFlaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lowered at sunset;\nBurn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall;\n        cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses;\nAppearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are;\nYou necessary film, continue to envelop the soul;\nAbout my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas;\nThrive, cities! bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient\n        rivers!\nExpand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual!\nKeep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting!\n\nWe descend upon you and all things--we arrest you all;\nWe realise the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids;\nThrough you colour, form, location, sublimity, ideality;\nThrough you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and\n        determinations of ourselves.\n\nYou have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers! you\n        novices!\nWe receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward;\nNot you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us;\nWe use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us;\nWe fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also;\nYou furnish your parts toward eternity;\nGreat or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.\n\n\n\n_NIGHT AND DEATH._\n\n\n1.\n\nNight on the prairies.\nThe supper is over--the fire on the ground burns low;\nThe wearied emigrants sleep, wrapped in their blankets;\nI walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now I never\n        realised before.\n\nNow I absorb immortality and peace,\nI admire death, and test propositions.\n\nHow plenteous! How spiritual! How _resumé_!\nThe same Old Man and Soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content.\n\n\n2.\n\nI was thinking the day most splendid, till I saw what the not day\n        exhibited,\nI was thinking this globe enough, till there sprang out so noiseless around\n        me myriads of other globes.\n\nNow, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, I will measure\n        myself by them:\nAnd now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along as\n        those of the earth,\nOr waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,\nI henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,\nOr the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.\n\n\n3.\n\nO I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me-as the day cannot,\nI see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.\n\n\n\n_ELEMENTAL DRIFTS._\n\n\n1.\n\nElemental drifts!\nO I wish I could impress others as you and the waves have just been\n        impressing me.\n\nAs I ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,\nAs I wended the shores I know,\nAs I walked where the sea-ripples wash you, Paumanok,\nWhere they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,\nWhere the fierce old Mother endlessly cries for her castaways,\nI, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,\nAlone, held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which I have\n        uttered my poems,\nWas seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,\nIn the rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the land of\n        the globe.\n\nFascinated, my eyes, reverting from the south, dropped, to follow those\n        slender winrows,\nChaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,\nScum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide;\nMiles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,\nPaumanok, there and then, as I thought the old thought of likenesses.\nThese you presented to me, you fish-shaped Island,\nAs I wended the shores I know,\nAs I walked with that eternal self of me, seeking types.\n\n\n2.\n\nAs I wend to the shores I know not,\nAs I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wrecked,\nAs I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,\nAs the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,\nI too but signify, at the utmost, a little washed-up drift,\nA few sands and dead leaves to gather,\nGather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.\n\nO baffled, baulked, bent to the very earth,\nOppressed with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,\nAware now that, amid all the blab whose echoes recoil upon me, I have not\n        once had the least idea who or what I am,\nBut that before all my insolent poems, the real ME stands yet untouched,\n        untold, altogether unreached,\nWithdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,\nWith peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,\nPointing in silence to all these songs, and then to the sand beneath.\n\nNow I perceive I have not understood anything--not a single object--and\n        that no man ever can.\n\nI perceive Nature, here in sight of the sea, is taking advantage of me, to\n        dart upon me, and sting me,\nBecause I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.\n\n\n3.\n\nYou oceans both! I close with you;\nThese little shreds shall indeed stand for all.\n\nYou friable shore, with trails of debris!\nYou fish-shaped Island! I take what is underfoot;\nWhat is yours is mine, my father.\n\nI too, Paumanok,\nI too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been washed on\n        your shores;\nI too am but a trail of drift and debris,\nI too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped Island.\n\nI throw myself upon your breast, my father,\nI cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,\nI hold you so firm till you answer me something.\n\nKiss me, my father,\nTouch me with your lips, as I touch those I love,\nBreathe to me, while I hold you close, the secret of the wondrous murmuring\nI envy.\n\n\n4.\n\nEbb, ocean of life, (the flow will return.)\nCease not your moaning, you fierce old Mother,\nEndlessly cry for your castaways--but fear not, deny not me,\nRustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet, as I touch you, or\n        gather from you.\n\nI mean tenderly by you,\nI gather for myself, and for this phantom, looking down where we lead, and\nfollowing me and mine.\n\nMe and mine!\nWe, loose winrows, little corpses,\nFroth, snowy white, and bubbles,\n(See! from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last!\nSee--the prismatic colours, glistening and rolling!)\nTufts of straw, sands, fragments,\nBuoyed hither from many moods, one contradicting another,\nFrom the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell;\nMusing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil;\nUp just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown;\nA limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at\n        random;\nJust as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature;\nJust as much, whence we come, that blare of the cloud-trumpets;\nWe, capricious, brought hither, we know not whence, spread out before you,\nYou, up there, walking or sitting,\nWhoever you are--we too lie in drifts at your feet.\n\n\n\n\n_WONDERS._\n\n\n1.\n\nWho learns my lesson complete?\nBoss, journeyman, apprentice--churchman and atheist,\nThe stupid and the wise thinker--parents and offspring--merchant, clerk,\n        porter, and customer,\nEditor, author, artist; and schoolboy--Draw nigh and commence;\nIt is no lesson--it lets down the bars to a good lesson,\nAnd that to another, and every one to another still.\n\n\n2.\n\nThe great laws take and effuse without argument;\nI am of the same style, for I am their friend,\nI love them quits and quits--I do not halt and make salaams.\n\nI lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, and the reasons of\n        things;\nThey are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.\nI cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself--it is\n        very wonderful.\n\nIt is no small matter, this round and delicious globe, moving so exactly in\n        its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt, or the untruth of a\n        single second;\nI do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten\n        billions of years,\nNor planned and built one thing after another, as an architect plans and\n        builds a house.\nI do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,\nNor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,\nNor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.\n\n\n3.\n\nIs it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal;\nI know it is wonderful--but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was\n        conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful;\nAnd passed from a babe, in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and\n        winters, to articulate and walk--All this is equally wonderful.\n\nAnd that my Soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without\n        ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is\n        every bit as wonderful.\n\nAnd that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful;\nAnd that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is\n        just as wonderful.\nAnd that the moon spins round the earth, and on with the earth, is equally\n        wonderful;\nAnd that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally\n        wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n_MIRACLES._\n\n\n1.\n\nWhat shall I give? and which are my miracles?\n\n\n2.\n\nRealism is mine--my miracles--Take freely,\nTake without end--I offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you or\n        your eyes reach.\n\n\n3.\n\nWhy! who makes much of a miracle?\nAs to me, I know of nothing else but miracles,\nWhether I walk the streets of Manhattan,\nOr dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,\nOr wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,\nOr stand under trees in the woods,\nOr talk by day with any one I love--or sleep in the bed at night with any\n        one I love,\nOr sit at the table at dinner with my mother,\nOr look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,\nOr watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,\nOr animals feeding in the fields,\nOr birds--or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,\nOr the wonderfulness of the sundown--or of stars shining so quiet and\n        bright,\nOr the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;\nOr whether I go among those I like best, and that like me best--mechanics,\n        boatmen, farmers,\nOr among the savans--or to the _soirée_--or to the opera.\nOr stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,\nOr behold children at their sports,\nOr the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,\nOr the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,\nOr my own eyes and figure in the glass;\nThese, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,\nThe whole referring--yet each distinct and in its place.\n\n\n4.\n\nTo me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,\nEvery inch of space is a miracle,\nEvery square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,\nEvery cubic foot of the interior swarms with the same;\nEvery spear of grass--the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all\n        that concerns them,\nAll these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.\n\nTo me the sea is a continual miracle;\nThe fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the ships, with\n        men in them,\nWhat stranger miracles are there?\n\n\n\n\n_VISAGES._\n\n\nOf the visages of things--And of piercing through to the accepted hells\n        beneath.\nOf ugliness--To me there is just as much in it as there is in\n        beauty--And now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.\nOf detected persons--To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse\n        than undetected persons--and are not in any respect worse than I am\n        myself.\nOf criminals--To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal--and any\n        reputable person is also--and the President is also.\n\n\n\n_THE DARK SIDE._\n\n\nI sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all\n        oppression and shame;\nI hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with themselves,\n        remorseful after deeds done;\nI see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying, neglected,\n        gaunt, desperate;\nI see the wife misused by her husband--I see the treacherous seducer of\n        young women;\nI mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be hid--\n        I see these sights on the earth;\nI see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny--I see martyrs and\n        prisoners;\nI observe a famine at sea--I observe the sailors casting lots who shall be\n        killed, to preserve the lives of the rest;\nI observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon\n        labourers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;\nAll these--all the meanness and agony without end, I, sitting, look out\n        upon;\nSee, hear, and am silent.\n\n\n\n\n_MUSIC._\n\n\nI heard you, solemn-sweet pipes of the organ, as last Sunday morn I passed\n        the church;\nWinds of autumn!--as I walked the woods at dusk, I heard your\n        long-stretched sighs, up above, so mournful;\nI heard the perfect Italian tenor, singing at the opera--I heard the\n        soprano in the midst of the quartette singing.\n--Heart of my love! you too I heard, murmuring low, through one of the\n        wrists around my head;\nHeard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last night\n        under my ear.\n\n\n\n_WHEREFORE?_\n\n\nO me! O life!--of the questions of these recurring;\nOf the endless trains of the faithless--of cities filled with the foolish;\nOf myself for ever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and\n        who more faithless?)\nOf eyes that vainly crave the light--of the objects mean--of the struggle\n        ever renewed;\nOf the poor results of all--of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around\n        me;\nOf the empty and useless years of the rest--with the rest me intertwined;\nThe question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?\n\n\n\n_ANSWER_.\n\n\nThat you are here--that life exists, and identity;\nThat the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.\n\n\n\n_QUESTIONABLE._\n\n\nAs I lay with my head in your lap, camerado,\nThe confession I made I resume--what I said to you and the open air I\n        resume.\nI know I am restless, and make others so;\nI know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;\n(Indeed I am myself the real soldier;\nIt is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the red-striped\n        artilleryman;)\nFor I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them;\nI am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have been\n        had all accepted me;\nI heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities,\n        nor ridicule;\nAnd the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me;\nAnd the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.\n--Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still urge\n        you, without the least idea what is our destination,\nOr whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quelled and defeated.\n\n\n\n_SONG AT SUNSET._\n\n\n1.\n\nSplendour of ended day, floating and filling me!\nHour prophetic--hour resuming the past:\nInflating my throat--you, divine Average!\nYou, Earth and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.\n\n\n2.\n\nOpen mouth of my soul, uttering gladness,\nEyes of my soul, seeing perfection,\nNatural life of me, faithfully praising things;\nCorroborating for ever the triumph of things.\n\n3.\n\nIllustrious every one!\nIllustrious what we name space--sphere of unnumbered spirits;\nIllustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, even the tiniest insect;\nIllustrious the attribute of speech--the senses--the body;\nIllustrious the passing light! Illustrious the pale reflection on the new\n        moon in the western sky!\nIllustrious whatever I see, or hear, or touch, to the last.\n\nGood in all,\nIn the satisfaction and _aplomb_ of animals,\nIn the annual return of the seasons,\nIn the hilarity of youth,\nIn the strength and flush of manhood,\nIn the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,\nIn the superb vistas of Death.\n\nWonderful to depart;\nWonderful to be here!\nThe heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood,\nTo breathe the air, how delicious!\nTo speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand!\nTo prepare for sleep, for bed--to look on my rose-coloured flesh,\nTo be conscious of my body, so happy, so large,\nTo be this incredible God I am,\nTo have gone forth among other Gods--those men and women I love.\n\nWonderful how I celebrate you and myself!\nHow my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!\nHow the clouds pass silently overhead!\n\nHow the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and\n        on!\nHow the water sports and sings! (Surely it is alive!)\nHow the trees rise and stand up--with strong trunks--with branches and\n        leaves!\nSurely there is something more in each of the trees--some living soul.\n\nO amazement of things! even the least particle!\nO spirituality of things!\nO strain musical, flowing through ages and continents--now reaching me and\n        America!\nI take your strong chords--I intersperse them, and cheerfully pass them\n        forward.\n\nI too carol the sun, ushered, or at noon, or, as now, setting,\nI too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and of all the growths of\n        the earth,\nI too have felt the resistless call of myself.\n\nAs I sailed down the Mississippi,\nAs I wandered over the prairies,\nAs I have lived--As I have looked through my windows, my eyes,\nAs I went forth in the morning--As I beheld the light breaking in the east;\nAs I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach of the\n        Western Sea;\nAs I roamed the streets of inland Chicago-whatever streets I have roamed;\nWherever I have been, I have charged myself with contentment and triumph.\n\nI sing the Equalities;\nI sing the endless finales of things;\nI say Nature continues--Glory continues;\nI praise with electric voice:\nFor I do not see one imperfection in the universe;\nAnd I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe.\n\nO setting sun! though the time has come,\nI still warble under you unmitigated adoration.\n\n\n\n_LONGINGS FOR HOME._\n\n\nO Magnet South! O glistening, perfumed South! my South!\nO quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! good and evil! O all dear to\n        me!\nO dear to me my birth-things--all moving things, and the trees where I was\n        born,[1] the grains, plants, rivers;\nDear to me my own slow, sluggish rivers, where they flow distant over flats\n        of silvery sands or through swamps;\nDear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the Pedee, the\n        Tombigbee, the Santee, the Coosa, and the Sabine--\nO pensive, far away wandering, I return with my soul to haunt their banks\n        again.\nAgain in Florida I float on transparent lakes--I float on Okeechobee--I\n        cross\nthe hummock land, or through pleasant openings or dense forests.\nI see the parrots in the woods, I see the papaw-tree, and the blossoming\n        titi.\nAgain, sailing in my coaster, on deck, I coast off Georgia, I coast up the\n        Carolinas;\nI see where the live-oak is growing--I see where the yellow-pine, the\n        scented bay-tree, the lemon and orange, the cypress, the graceful\n        palmetto.\nI pass rude sea-headlands, and enter Pamlico Sound through an inlet, and\n        dart my vision inland;\nO the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp!\nThe cactus, guarded with thorns--the laurel-tree, with large white flowers;\nThe range afar--the richness and barrenness--the old woods charged with\n        mistletoe and trailing moss,\nThe piney odour and the gloom--the awful natural stillness, Here in these\n        dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave\n        has his concealed hut;\nO the strange fascination of these half-known, half-impassable swamps,\n        infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow of the alligator,\n        the sad noises of the night-owl and the wild-cat, and the whirr of\n        the rattlesnake;\nThe mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon--singing\n        through the moon-lit night,\nThe humming-bird, the wild-turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;\nA Tennessee corn-field--the tall, graceful, long-leaved corn--slender,\n        flapping, bright green, with tassels--with beautiful ears, each\n        well-sheathed in its husk;\nAn Arkansas prairie--a sleeping lake, or still bayou.\nO my heart! O tender and fierce pangs--I can stand them not--I will depart!\nO to be a Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian!\nO longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Tennessee, and never\n        wander more!\n\n[Footnote 1: These expressions cannot be understood in a literal\nsense, for Whitman was born, not in the South, but in the State\nof New York. The precise sense to be attached to them may be open\nto some difference of opinion.]\n\n\n\n_APPEARANCES._\n\n\nOf the terrible doubt of appearances,\nOf the uncertainty after all--that we may be deluded,\nThat maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all,\nThat maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,\nMaybe the things I perceive--the animals, plants, men, hills, shining and\n        flowing waters,\nThe skies of day and night--colours, densities, forms--Maybe these are (as\n        doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has\n        yet to be known;\n(How often they dart out of themselves, as if to confound me and mock me!\nHow often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them!)\nMaybe seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as\n        from my present point of view--And might prove (as of course they\n        would) naught of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely\n        changed points of view;\n--To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answered by my lovers,\n        my dear friends.\nWhen he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the\n        hand,\nWhen the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold\n        not, surround us and pervade us,\nThen I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom--I am silent--I require\n        nothing further,\nI cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the\n        grave;\nBut I walk or sit indifferent--I am satisfied,\nHe ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.\n\n\n_THE FRIEND._\n\n\nRecorders ages hence!\nCome, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior--I will tell\n        you what to say of me;\nPublish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,\nThe friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was\n        fondest,\nWho was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within\n        him--and freely poured it forth,\nWho often walked lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,\nWho pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleepless and dissatisfied\n        at night,\nWho knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he loved might secretly\n        be indifferent to him,\nWhose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on hills, he\n        and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain, apart from other\n        men,\nWho oft, as he sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the shoulder of\n        his friend--while the arm of his friend rested upon him also.\n\n\n\n_MEETING AGAIN._\n\n\nWhen I heard at the close of the day how my name had been received with\n        plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that\n        followed;\nAnd else, when I caroused, or when my plans were accomplished, still I was\n        not happy.\nBut the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refreshed,\n        singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,\nWhen I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning\n        light,\nWhen I wandered alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with\n        the cool waters, and saw the sunrise,\nAnd when I thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, O\n        then I was happy;\nO then each breath tasted sweeter--and all that day my food nourished me\n        more--and the beautiful day passed well,\nAnd the next came with equal joy--and with the next, at evening, came my\n        friend;\nAnd that night, while all was still, I heard the waters roll slowly\n        continually up the shores,\nI heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me,\n        whispering, to congratulate me;\nFor the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool\n        night,\nIn the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me,\nAnd his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night I was happy.\n\n\n\n_A DREAM._\n\n\nOf him I love day and night, I dreamed I heard he was dead;\nAnd I dreamed I went where they had buried him I love--but he was not in\n        that place;\nAnd I dreamed I wandered, searching among burial-places, to find him;\nAnd I found that every place was a burial-place;\nThe houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now;)\nThe streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago, Boston,\nPhiladelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,\nAnd fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living.\n--And what I dreamed I will henceforth tell to every person and age,\nAnd I stand henceforth bound to what I dreamed;\nAnd now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with them;\nAnd if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even\n        in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied;\nAnd if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly rendered\n        to powder, and poured in the sea, I shall be satisfied;\nOr if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be satisfied.\n\n\n\n_PARTING FRIENDS._\n\n\nWhat think you I take my pen in hand to record?\nThe battle-ship, perfect-modelled, majestic, that I saw pass the offing to-\n        day under full sail?\nThe splendours of the past day? Or the splendour of the night that envelops\n        me?\nOr the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?--No;\nBut I record of two simple men I saw to-day, on the pier, in the midst of\n        the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends;\nThe one to remain hung on the other's neck, and passionately kissed him,\nWhile the one to depart tightly pressed the one to remain in his arms.\n\n\n\n_TO A STRANGER._\n\n\nPassing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you;\nYou must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking (it comes to me, as of a\n        dream).\nI have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you.\nAll is recalled as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste,\n        matured;\nYou grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl with me;\nI ate with you, and slept with you--your body has become not yours only,\n        nor left my body mine only;\nYou give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass--you take of\n        my beard, breast, hands in return;\nI am not to speak to you--I am to think of you when I sit alone, or wake at\n        night alone;\nI am to wait--I do not doubt I am to meet you again;\nI am to see to it that I do not lose you.\n\n\n\n_OTHER LANDS._\n\n\nThis moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,\nIt seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful;\nIt seems to me I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France,\n        Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking\n        other dialects;\nAnd it seems to me, if I could know those men, I should become attached to\n        them, as I do to men in my own lands.\nO I know we should be brethren and lovers;\nI know I should be happy with them.\n\n\n\n_ENVY._\n\nWhen I peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty\n        generals, I do not envy the generals,\nNor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house.\n\nBut when I read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them;\nHow through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long,\nThrough youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how\n        affectionate and faithful they were,\nThen I am pensive--I hastily put down the book, and walk away, filled with\nthe bitterest envy.\n\n\n\n_THE CITY OF FRIENDS._\n\n\nI dreamed in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of\n        the rest of the earth;\nI dreamed that it was the new City of Friends;\nNothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the rest;\nIt was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,\nAnd in all their looks and words.\n\n\n\n_OUT OF THE CROWD._\n\n\n1.\n\nOut of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,\nWhispering, _I love you; before long I die:\nI have travelled a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you:\nFor I could not die till I once looked on you,\nFor I feared I might afterward lose you_.\n\n\n2.\n\nNow we have met, we have looked, we are safe;\nReturn in peace to the ocean, my love;\nI too am part of that ocean, my love--we are not so much separated;\nBehold the great _rondure_--the cohesion of all, how perfect!\nBut as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,\nAs for an hour carrying us diverse--yet cannot carry us diverse for ever;\nBe not impatient--a little space--know you, I salute the air, the ocean,\n        and the land,\nEvery day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.\n\n\n\n_AMONG THE MULTITUDE._\n\n\nAmong the men and women, the multitude,\nI perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,\nAcknowledging none else--not parent, wife, husband, brother, child, any\n        nearer than I am;\nSome are baffled--But that one is not--that one knows me.\n\nAh, lover and perfect equal!\nI meant that you should discover me so, by my faint indirections;\nAnd I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the like in you.\n\n\n\n\nLEAVES OF GRASS.\n\n\n\n_PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S FUNERAL HYMN._\n\n\n1.\n\nWhen lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,\nAnd the great star[1] early drooped in the western sky in the night,\nI mourned,...and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.\n\nO ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;\nLilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,\nAnd thought of him I love.\n\n\n2.\n\nO powerful, western, fallen star!\nO shades of night! O moody, tearful night!\nO great star disappeared! O the black murk that hides the star!\nO cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul of me!\nO harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul!\n\n\n3.\n\nIn the door-yard fronting an old farm-house, near the whitewashed palings,\nStands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich\n        green,\nWith many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the perfume strong I\n        love,\nWith every leaf a miracle: and from this bush in the dooryard,\nWith delicate-coloured blossoms, and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\nA sprig, with its flower, I break.\n\n\n4.\n\nIn the swamp, in secluded recesses,\nA shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.\n\nSolitary, the thrush,\nThe hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\nSings by himself a song:\n\nSong of the bleeding throat!\nDeath's outlet song of life--for well, dear brother, I know,\nIf thou wast not gifted to sing, thou wouldst surely die.\n\n\n5.\n\nOver the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,\nAmid lanes, and through old woods, where lately the violets peeped from the\n        ground, spotting the greydebris;\nAmid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes--passing the endless\n        grass;\nPassing the yellow-speared wheat, every grain from its shroud in the\n        dark-brown fields uprising;\nPassing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards;\nCarrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,\nNight and day journeys a coffin.\n\n\n6.\n\nCoffin that passes through lanes and streets,\nThrough day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,\nWith the pomp of the inlooped flags, with the cities draped in black,\nWith the show of the States themselves as of crape-veiled women standing,\nWith processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,\nWith the countless torches lit--with the silent sea of faces,\n        and the unbared heads,\nWith the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,\nWith dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and\n        solemn;\nWith all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,\nThe dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--Where amid these you\n        journey,\nWith the tolling, tolling bells' perpetual clang;\nHere! coffin that slowly passes,\nI give you my sprig of lilac.\n\n\n7.\n\nNor for you, for one, alone;\nBlossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:\nFor fresh as the morning--thus would I chant a song for you, O sane and\n        sacred Death.\n\nAll over bouquets of roses,\nO Death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;\nBut mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,\nCopious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes!\nWith loaded arms I come, pouring for you,\nFor you and the coffins all of you, O Death.\n\n\n8.\n\nO western orb, sailing the heaven!\nNow I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walked,\nAs we walked up and down in the dark blue so mystic,\nAs we walked in silence the transparent shadowy night,\nAs I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night,\nAs you drooped from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other\n        stars all looked on;\nAs we wandered together the solemn night, for something, I know not what,\n        kept me from sleep;\nAs the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how\n        full you were of woe;\nAs I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cool transparent\n        night,\nAs I watched where you passed and was lost in the netherward  black of the\n        night,\nAs my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,\nConcluded, dropped in the night, and was gone.\n\n\n9.\n\nSing on, there in the swamp!\nO singer bashful and tender! I hear your notes--I hear your call;\nI hear--I come presently--I understand you;\nBut a moment I linger--for the lustrous star has detained me;\nThe star, my comrade departing, holds and detains me.\n\n\n10.\n\nO how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?\nAnd how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\nAnd what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\n\nSea-winds, blown from east and west,\nBlown from the Eastern Sea, and blown from the Western Sea, till there on\n        the prairies meeting:\nThese, and with these, and the breath of my chant,\nI perfume the grave of him I love.\n\n\n11.\n\nO what shall I hang on the chamber walls?\nAnd what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\nTo adorn the burial-house of him I love?\n\nPictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,\nWith the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the grey smoke lucid and bright,\nWith floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent sinking sun,\n        burning, expanding the air;\nWith the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the\n        trees prolific;\nIn the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river,\n        with a wind-dapple here and there;\nWith ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and\n        shadows;\nAnd the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,\nAnd all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward\n        returning.\n\n\n12.\n\nLo! body and soul! this land!\nMighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and\n        the ships;\nThe varied and ample land--the South and the North in the\nlight--Ohio's shores, and flashing Missouri,\nAnd ever the far-spreading prairies, covered with grass and corn.\n\nLo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty;\nThe violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes;\nThe gentle, soft-born, measureless light;\nThe miracle, spreading, bathing all--the fulfilled noon;\nThe coming eve, delicious--the welcome night, and the stars,\nOver my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.\n\n\n13.\n\nSing on! sing on, you grey-brown bird!\nSing from the swamps, the recesses--pour your chant from the bushes;\nLimitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\n\nSing on, dearest brother--warble your reedy song,\nLoud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\n\nO liquid, and free, and tender!\nO wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous singer!\nYou only I hear,... yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart;)\nYet the lilac, with mastering odour, holds me.\n\n\n14.\n\nNow while I sat in the day, and looked forth,\nIn the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the\n        farmer preparing his crops,\nIn the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests,\nIn the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturbed winds and the storms;\nUnder the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of\n        children and women,\nThe many-moving sea-tides,--and I saw the ships how they sailed,\nAnd the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with\n        labour,\nAnd the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals\nand minutiae of daily usages;\nAnd the streets, how their throbbings throbbed, and the cities\n        pent--lo! then and there,\nFalling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\nAppeared the cloud, appeared the long black trail;\nAnd I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of Death.\n\n\n15.\n\nAnd the Thought of Death close-walking the other side of me,\nAnd I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of\n        companions,\nI fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,\nDown to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\nTo the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still.\n\nAnd the singer so shy to the rest received me;\nThe grey-brown bird I know received us Comrades three;\nAnd he sang what seemed the song of Death, and a verse for him I love.\n\nFrom deep secluded recesses,\nFrom the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,\nCame the singing of the bird.\n\nAnd the charm of the singing rapt me,\nAs I held, as if by their hands, my Comrades in the night;\nAnd the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\n\n\n16.\n\nCome, lovely and soothing Death,\nUndulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\nIn the day, in the night, to all, to each,\nSooner or later, delicate Death.\n\nPraised be the fathomless universe,\nFor life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;\nAnd for love, sweet love--But praise! O praise and praise,\nFor the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death.\n\nDark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,\nHave none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\nThen I chant it for thee--I glorify thee above all;\nI bring thee a song that, when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\n\nApproach, encompassing Death-strong deliveress!\nWhen it is so--when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,\nLost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,\nLaved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.\n\nFrom me to thee glad serenades,\nDances for thee I propose, saluting thee--adornments and feastings for\n        thee;\nAnd the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting,\nAnd life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\n\nThe night, in silence, under many a star;\nThe ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;\nAnd the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veiled Death,\nAnd the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\n\nOver the tree-tops I float thee a song!\nOver the rising and sinking waves--over the myriad fields, and the prairies\n        wide;\nOver the dense-packed cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,\nI float this carol with joy, with joy, to thee, O Death!\n\n\n17.\n\nTo the tally of my soul\nLoud and strong kept up the grey-brown bird,\nWith pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night.\n\nLoud in the pines and cedars dim,\nClear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume,\nAnd I with my Comrades there in the night.\n\nWhile my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\nAs to long panoramas of visions.\n\n\n18.\n\n\nI saw the vision of armies;\nAnd I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags;\nBorne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles, I saw\n        them,\nAnd carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody;\nAnd at last but a few shreds of the flags left on the staffs, (and all in\n        silence,)\nAnd the staffs all splintered and broken.\n\nI saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\nAnd the white skeletons of young men--I saw them;\nI saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers.\nBut I saw they were not as was thought;\nThey themselves were fully at rest--they suffered not;\nThe living remained and suffered--the mother suffered,\nAnd the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffered,\nAnd the armies that remained suffered.\n\n\n19.\n\nPassing the visions, passing the night;\nPassing, unloosing the hold of my Comrades' hands;\nPassing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul;\nVictorious song, Death's outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song;\nAs low and wailing, yet clear, the notes, rising and falling, flooding the\n        night,\nSadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting\n        with joy.\nCovering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,\nAs that powerful psalm in the night, I heard from recesses.\n\n\n20.\n\nMust I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves?\nMust I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring?\n\nMust I pass from my song for thee--\nFrom my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\nO comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night?\n\n\n21.\n\nYet each I keep, and all;\nThe song, the wondrous chant of the grey-brown bird,\nAnd the tallying chant, the echo aroused in my soul,\nWith the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe;\nWith the lilac tali, and its blossoms of mastering odour;\nComrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep--for the\n        dead I loved so well;\nFor the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for his\n        dear sake;\nLilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,\nWith the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,\nThere in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.\n\n[Footnote 1: \"The evening star, which, as many may remember night after\nnight, in the early part of that eventful spring, hung low in the west with\nunusual and tender brightness.\"--JOHN BURROUGHS.]\n\n\n\n_O CAPTAIN!

O pioneers!\n\n\n\n_TO THE SAYERS OF WORDS._\n\n\n1.\n\nEarth, round, rolling, compact--suns, moons, animals--all these are words\n        to be said;\nWatery, vegetable, sauroid advances--beings, premonitions, lispings of\n        the future,\nBehold! these are vast words to be said.\n\nWere you thinking that those were the words--those upright lines? those\n        curves, angles, dots?\nNo, those are not the words--the substantial words are in the ground and\n        sea,\nThey are in the air--they are in you.\n\nWere you thinking that those were the words--those delicious sounds out of\n        your friends' mouths?\nNo; the real words are more delicious than they.\n\nHuman bodies are words, myriads of words;\nIn the best poems reappears the body, man's or woman's, well-shaped,\n        natural, gay;\nEvery part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.\n\nAir, soil, water, fire--these are words;\nI myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate\n        with theirs--my name is nothing to them;\nThough it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air, soil,\nwater, fire, know of my name?\n\nA healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings,\n        meanings;\nThe charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women are sayings\n        and meanings also.\n\n\n2.\n\nThe workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth;\nThe great masters know the earth's words, and use them more than the\n        audible words.\n\nAmelioration is one of the earth's words;\nThe earth neither lags nor hastens;\nIt has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump;\nIt is not half beautiful only--defects and excrescences show just as much\n        as perfections show.\n\nThe earth does not withhold--it is generous enough;\nThe truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either;\nThey are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;\nThey are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,\nConveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth. I utter and utter:\nI speak not; yet, if you hear me not, of what avail am I to you?\nTo bear--to better; lacking these, of what avail am I?\n\n_Accouche! Accouchez!_\nWill you rot your own fruit in yourself there?\nWill you squat and stifle there?\n\nThe earth does not argue,\nIs not pathetic, has no arrangements,\nDoes not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,\nMakes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,\nCloses nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out;\nOf all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.\n\nThe earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itself--possesses\n        still underneath;\nUnderneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of\n        slaves,\nPersuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young\n        people, accents of bargainers,\nUnderneath these, possessing the words that never fail.\n\nTo her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great Mother never fail;\nThe true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does\n        not fail;\nAlso the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail.\n\n\n3.\n\nOf the interminable sisters,\nOf the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,\nOf the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,\nThe beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.\n\nWith her ample back towards every beholder,\nWith the fascinations of youth, and the equal fascinations of age,\nSits she whom I too love like the rest--sits undisturbed,\nHolding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her eyes\n        glance back from it,\nGlance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,\nHolding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.\n\nSeen at hand, or seen at a distance,\nDuly the twenty-four appear in public every day,\nDuly approach and pass with their companions, or a companion,\nLooking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances of\n        those who are with them,\nFrom the countenances of children or women, or the manly countenance,\nFrom the open countenances of animals, or from inanimate things,\nFrom the landscape or waters, or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,\nFrom our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,\nEvery day in public appearing without fail, but never twice with the same\n        companions.\n\nEmbracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and\n        sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;\nEmbracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty-\n        five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.\n\nTumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,\nSunshine, storm, cold, heat, for ever withstanding, passing, carrying,\n\nThe Soul's realisation and determination still inheriting;\nThe fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,\nNo baulk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,\nSwift, glad, content, unbereaved, nothing losing,\nOf all able and ready at any time to give strict account,\nThe divine ship sails the divine sea.\n\n\n4.\n\nWhoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you;\nThe divine ship sails the divine sea for you.\n\nWhoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid,\nYou are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky;\nFor none more than you are the present and the past,\nFor none more than you is immortality.\n\nEach man to himself, and each woman to herself, such as the word of the\n        past and present, and the word of immortality;\nNo one can acquire for another--not one!\nNot one can grow for another--not one!\n\nThe song is to the singer, and comes back most to him;\nThe teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him;\nThe murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him;\n\nThe theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;\nThe love is to the lover, and conies back most to him;\nThe gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him--it cannot fail;\nThe oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress, not\n        to the audience;\nAnd no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or the\n        indication of his own.\n\n\n5.\n\nI swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall be\n        complete!\nI swear the earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains\n        broken and jagged!\n\nI swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those of the\n        earth!\nI swear there can be no theory of any account, unless it corroborate the\n        theory of the earth!\nNo politics, art, religion, behaviour, or what not, is of account, unless\n        it compare with the amplitude of the earth,\nUnless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude, of the\n        earth.\n\nI swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which responds\n        love!\nIt is that which contains itself--which never invites, and never refuses.\n\nI swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words!\nI swear I think all merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings\n        of the earth;\nToward him who sings the songs of the Body, and of the truths of the earth;\nToward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch.\n\nI swear I see what is better than to tell the best;\nIt is always to leave the best untold.\n\nWhen I undertake to tell the best, I find I cannot,\nMy tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,\nMy breath will not be obedient to its organs,\nI become a dumb man.\n\nThe best of the earth cannot be told anyhow--all or any is best;\nIt is not what you anticipated--it is cheaper, easier, nearer;\nThings are not dismissed from the places they held before;\nThe earth is just as positive and direct as it was before;\nFacts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before;\nBut the Soul is also real,--it too is positive and direct;\nNo reasoning, no proof has established it,\nUndeniable growth has established it.\n\n\n6.\n\nThis is a poem for the sayers of words--these are hints of meanings,\nThese are they that echo the tones of souls, and the phrases of souls;\nIf they did not echo the phrases of souls, what were they then?\nIf they had not reference to you in especial, what were they then?\nI swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the\n        best!\nI will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.\n\n\n7.\n\nSay on, sayers!\nDelve! mould! pile the words of the earth!\nWork on--it is materials you bring, not breaths;\nWork on, age after age! nothing is to be lost!\nIt may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use;\nWhen the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear.\n\nI swear to you the architects shall appear without fail! I announce them\n        and lead them;\nI swear to you they will understand you and justify you;\nI swear to you the greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and\n        encloses all, and is faithful to all;\nI swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget you--they shall perceive\n        that you are not an iota less than they;\nI swear to you, you shall be glorified in them.\n\n\n\n_VOICES._\n\n\n1.\n\nNow I make a leaf of Voices--for I have found nothing mightier than they\n        are,\nAnd I have found that no word spoken but is beautiful in its place.\n\n\n2.\n\nO what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?\nSurely, whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow,\nAs the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps anywhere around\n        the globe.\n\nAll waits for the right voices;\nWhere is the practised and perfect organ? Where is the developed Soul?\nFor I see every word uttered thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,\n        impossible on less terms.\n\nI see brains and lips closed--tympans and temples unstruck,\nUntil that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,\nUntil that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering,\n        for ever ready, in all words.\n\n\n\n_WHOSOEVER._\n\n\nWhoever you are, I fear you are walking the walks of dreams,\nI fear those supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands;\nEven now, your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners, troubles,\n        follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,\nYour true Soul and Body appear before me,\nThey stand forth out of affairs-out of commerce, shops, law, science, work,\n        farms, clothes, the house, medicine, print, buying, selling,\n        eating, drinking, suffering, dying.\n\nWhoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem;\nI whisper with my lips close to your ear,\nI have loved many women and men, but I love none better than you.\n\nOh! I have been dilatory and dumb;\nI should have made my way straight to you long ago;\nI should have blabbed nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing but\n        you.\n\nI will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you;\nNone have understood you, but I understand you;\nNone have done justice to you--you have not done justice to yourself;\nNone but have found you imperfect--I only find no imperfection in you;\nNone but would subordinate you--I only am he who will never consent to\n        subordinate you;\nI only am he who places over you no master, owner, better, God, beyond what\n        waits intrinsically in yourself.\n\nPainters have painted their swarming groups, and the centre figure of all,\nFrom the head of the centre figure spreading a nimbus of\n        gold-coloured light;\nBut I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its nimbus of gold-\n        coloured light;\nFrom my hand, from the brain of every man and woman, it streams,\n        effulgently flowing for ever.\n\nO I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!\nYou have not known what you are--you have slumbered upon yourself all your\n        life;\nYour eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time;\nWhat you have done returns already in mockeries;\nYour thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mockeries, what\n        is their return?\n\nThe mockeries are not you;\nUnderneath them, and within them, I see you lurk;\nI pursue you where none else has pursued you;\nSilence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustomed\n        routine, if these conceal you from others, or from yourself, they\n        do not conceal you from me;\nThe shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these baulk\n        others, they do not baulk me.\nThe pert apparel, the deformed attitude, drunkenness, greed, premature\n        death, all these I part aside.\n\nThere is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you;\nThere is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in you;\nNo pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you;\nNo pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.\nAs for me, I give nothing to any one, except I give the like carefully to\n        you;\nI sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than I sing the\n        songs of the glory of you.\n\nWhoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!\nThese shows of the east and west are tame compared to you;\nThese immense meadows--these interminable rivers--you are immense and\n        interminable as they;\nThese furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of apparent\n        dissolution--you are he or she who is master or mistress over them,\nMaster or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain, passion,\n        dissolution.\n\nThe hopples fall from your ankles--you find an unfailing sufficiency;\nOld or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever you\n        are promulgates itself;\nThrough birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is\n        scanted;\nThrough angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks its\n        way.\n\n\n\n_BEGINNERS._\n\n\nHow they are provided for upon the earth, appearing at intervals;\nHow dear and dreadful they are to the earth;\nHow they inure to themselves as much as to any--What a paradox appears\n        their age;\nHow people respond to them, yet know them not;\nHow there is something relentless in their fate, all times;\nHow all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\nAnd how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great\n        purchase.\n\n\n\n\n_TO A PUPIL._\n\n\n1.\n\nIs reform needed?

Do you hear\n        the ironical echoes?)\n\nBooks, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride, beat up\n        and down, seeking to give satisfaction;\nHe indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down\n        also.\n\nWhichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly and\n        gently and safely, by day or by night;\nHe has the pass-key of hearts--to him the response of the prying of hands\n        on the knobs.\n\nHis welcome is universal--the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\n        universal than he is;\nThe person he favours by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\n\nEvery existence has its idiom--everything has an idiom and tongue;\nHe resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and any man\n        translates, and any man translates himself also;\nOne part does not counteract another part--he is the joiner--he sees how\n        they join.\n\nHe says indifferently and alike, \"_How are you, friend_?\" to the President\n        at his levee,\nAnd he says, \"_Good-day, my brother_!\" to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-\n        field,\nAnd both understand him, and know that his speech is right.\n\nHe walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,\nHe walks among the Congress, and one representative says to another, \"_Here\n        is our equal, appearing and new_.\"\n\n\n4.\n\nThen the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\nAnd the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he has\n        followed the sea,\nAnd the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\nAnd the labourers perceive he could labour with them and love them;\nNo matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has\n        followed it,\nNo matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters\n        there.\n\nThe English believe he comes of their English stock,\nA Jew to the Jew he seems--a Russ to the Russ--usual and near, removed from\n        none.\n\nWhoever he looks at in the travellers' coffee-house claims him;\nThe Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the Spaniard\n        is sure, and the island Cuban is sure;\nThe engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi, or\nSt. Lawrence, or Sacramento, or Hudson, or Paumanok Sound, claims him.\n\nThe gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood;\nThe insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves\n        in the ways of him--he strangely transmutes them,\nThey are not vile any more--they hardly know themselves, they are so grown.\n\n\n\n_BURIAL._\n\n\n1.\n\nTo think of it!\nTo think of time--of all that retrospection!\nTo think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!\nHave you guessed you yourself would not continue?\nHave you dreaded these earth-beetles?\nHave you feared the future would be nothing to you?\n\nIs to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?\nIf the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.\n\nTo think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were flexible,\n        real, alive! that everything was alive!\nTo think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!\nTo think that we are now here, and bear our part!\n\n\n2.\n\nNot a day passes--not a minute or second, without an accouchement!\nNot a day passes-not a minute or second, without a corpse!\n\nThe dull nights go over, and the dull days also,\nThe soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,\nThe physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look\n        for an answer,\nThe children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters are\n        sent for;\nMedicines stand unused on the shelf--(the camphor-smell has long pervaded\n        the rooms,)\nThe faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,\nThe twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,\nThe breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,\nThe corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,\nIt is palpable as the living are palpable.\n\nThe living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,\nBut without eyesight lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the\n        corpse.\n\n\n3.\n\nTo think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and the fruits\n        ripen, and act upon others as upon us now--yet not act upon us!\nTo think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great\n        interest in them--and we taking--no interest in them!\n\nTo think how eager we are in building our houses!\nTo think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!\nI see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or\n        eighty years at most,\nI see one building the house that serves him longer than that.\n\nSlow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never cease--\n        they are the burial lines;\nHe that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall surely\n        be buried.\n\n\n4.\n\nGold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river, half-\n        frozen mud in the streets, a grey discouraged sky overhead, the\n        short last daylight of Twelfth-month,\nA hearse and stages--other vehicles give place--the funeral of an old\nBroadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.\n\nSteady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the gate is\n        passed, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the\n        hearse uncloses,\nThe coffin is passed out, lowered, and settled, the whip is laid on the\n        coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in,\nThe mound above is flattened with the spades--silence,\nA minute, no one moves or speaks--it is done,\nHe is decently put away--is there anything more?\n\nHe was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered, not bad-looking, able\n        to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life\n        or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank\n        hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward\n        the last, sickened, was helped by a contribution, died, aged forty-\n        one years--and that was his funeral.\n\nThumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather\n        clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,\n        somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man\n        before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock,\n        mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at night;\nTo think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers--and he there\n        takes no interest in them!\n\n\n5.\n\nThe markets, the government, the working-man's wages--to think what account\n        they are through our nights and days!\nTo think that other working-men will make just as great account of them--\n        yet we make little or no account!\n\nThe vulgar and the refined--what you call sin, and what you call goodness--\n        to think how wide a difference!\nTo think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond\n        the difference.\n\nTo think how much pleasure there is!\nHave you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems?\nDo you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a\n        nomination and election? or with your wife and family?\nOr with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful\n        maternal cares?\nThese also flow onward to others--you and I fly onward,\nBut in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.\n\nYour farm, profits, crops,--to think how engrossed you are!\nTo think there will still be farms, profits, crops--yet for you, of what\n        avail?\n\n\n6.\n\nWhat will be will be well--for what is is well;\nTo take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.\n\nThe sky continues beautiful,\nThe pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of\n        women with men, nor the pleasure from poems;\nThe domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of\n        houses--these are not phantasms--they have weight, form, location;\nFarms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them\n        phantasms;\nThe difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,\nThe earth is not an echo--man and his life, and all the things of his life,\n        are well-considered.\n\nYou are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely around\n        yourself;\nYourself! Yourself! Yourself, for ever and ever!\n\n\n7.\n\nIt is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father--it\n        is to identify you;\nIt is not that you should be undecided, but that you should\n        be decided;\nSomething long preparing and formless is arrived and formed in you,\nYou are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.\n\nThe threads that were spun are gathered, the weft crosses the warp, the\n        pattern is systematic.\n\nThe preparations have every one been justified,\nThe orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments--the baton has\n        given the signal.\n\nThe guest that was coming--he waited long, for reasons--he is now housed;\nHe is one of those who are beautiful and happy--he is one of those that to\n        look upon and be with is enough.\n\nThe law of the past cannot be eluded,\nThe law of the present and future cannot be eluded,\nThe law of the living cannot be eluded--it is eternal;\nThe law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,\nThe law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,\nThe law of drunkards, informers, mean persons--not one iota thereof can be\n        eluded.\n\n\n8.\n\nSlow-moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,\nNortherner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the\n        Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and all\n        through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.\n\nThe great masters and kosmos are well as they go--the heroes and good-doers\n        are well,\nThe known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and\n        distinguished, may be well,\nBut there is more account than that--there is strict account of all.\n\nThe interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,\nThe barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,\nThe common people of Europe are not nothing--the American aborigines are\n        not nothing,\nThe infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing--the murderer or\n        mean person is not nothing,\nThe perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go,\nThe lowest prostitute is not nothing--the mocker of religion is not nothing\n        as he goes.\n\n\n9.\n\nI shall go with the rest--we have satisfaction,\nI have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us\n        changed,\nI have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and\n        past law,\nAnd that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past\n        law,\nFor I have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough.\n\nAnd I have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so much changed, and that\n        there is no life without satisfaction;\nWhat is the earth? what are Body and Soul without satisfaction?\n\nI shall go with the rest,\nWe cannot be stopped at a given point--that is no satisfaction,\nTo show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space of time--that is\n        no satisfaction,\nWe must have the indestructible breed of the best, regardless of time.\nIf otherwise, all these things came but to ashes of dung,\nIf maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betrayed!\nThen indeed suspicion of death.\n\nDo you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now:\nDo you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?\n\n\n10.\n\nPleasantly and well-suited I walk:\nWhither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good;\nThe whole universe indicates that it is good,\nThe past and the present indicate that it is good.\n\nHow beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my Soul!\nHow perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!\nWhat is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,\nThe vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids\n        are perfect;\nSlowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they\n        yet pass on.\n\nMy Soul! if I realise you, I have satisfaction;\nAnimals and vegetables! if I realise you, I have satisfaction;\nLaws of the earth and air! if I realise you, I have satisfaction.\n\nI cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so;\nI cannot define my life, yet it is so.\n\n\n11.\n\nIt comes to me now!\nI swear I think now that everything without exception has an eternal soul!\nThe trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the\n        animals!\n\nI swear I think there is nothing but immortality!\nThat the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and\n        the cohering is for it;\nAnd all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and death\n        are altogether for it!\n\n\n\n_THIS COMPOST._\n\n\n1.\n\nSomething startles me where I thought I was safest;\nI withdraw from the still woods I loved;\nI will not go now on the pastures to walk;\nI will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea;\nI will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew me.\n\n\n2.\n\nO how can the ground not sicken?\nHow can you be alive, you growths of spring?\nHow can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?\nAre they not continually putting distempered corpses in you?\nIs not every continent worked over and over with sour dead?\n\nWhere have you disposed of their carcasses?\nThose drunkards and gluttons of so many generations;\nWhere have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?\nI do not see any of it upon you to-day--or perhaps I am deceived;\nI will run a furrow with my plough--I will press my spade through the sod,\n        and turn it up underneath;\nI am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.\n\n\n3.\n\nBehold this compost! behold it well!\nPerhaps every mite has once formed part of a sick person--Yet behold!\nThe grass covers the prairies,\nThe bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,\nThe delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,\nThe apple-buds cluster together on the apple branches,\nThe resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,\nThe tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,\nThe he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit on their\n        nests,\nThe young of poultry break through the hatched eggs,\nThe new-born of animals appear--the calf is dropped from the cow, the colt\n        from the mare,\nOut of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark-green leaves,\nOut of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk;\nThe summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour\n        dead.\n\nWhat chemistry!\nThat the winds are really not infectious,\nThat this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which is so\n        amorous after me;\nThat it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its\n        tongues,\nThat it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves\n        in it,\nThat all is clean for ever and for ever,\nThat the cool drink from the well tastes so good,\nThat blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,\nThat the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-orchard--that\n        melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,\nThat when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,\nThough probably every sphere of grass rises out of what was once a catching\n        disease.\n\n\n4.\n\nNow I am terrified at the Earth! it is that calm and patient,\nIt grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,\nIt turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions\n        of diseased corpses,\nIt distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,\nIt renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,\nIt gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them\n        at last.\n\n\n\n_DESPAIRING CRIES._\n\n\n1.\n\nDespairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,\nThe sad voice of Death--the call of my nearest lover, putting forth,\n        alarmed, uncertain,\n\"_The Sea I am quickly to sail: come tell me,\nCome tell me where I am speeding--tell me my destination_.\"\n\n\n2.\n\nI understand your anguish, but I cannot help you;\nI approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes, your\n        mute inquiry,\n\"_Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me_.\"\nOld age, alarmed, uncertain--A young woman's voice, appealing to me for\n        comfort;\nA young man's voice, \"_Shall I not escape_?\"\n\n\n\n_THE CITY DEAD-HOUSE_\n\n\nBy the City Dead-House, by the gate,\nAs idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangour,\nI curious pause--for lo! an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought;\nHer corpse they deposit unclaimed, it lies on the damp brick pavement.\nThe divine woman, her body--I see the body--I look on it alone,\nThat house once full of passion and beauty--all else I notice not;\nNor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odours morbific\n        impress me;\nBut the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house--that\n        ruin!\nThat immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings ever built,\nOr white-domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure surmounted--or all the\n        old high-spired cathedrals,\nThat little house alone, more than them all--poor, desperate house!\nFair, fearful wreck! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!\nUnclaimed, avoided house! take one breath from my tremulous lips;\nTake one tear, dropped aside as I go, for thought of you,\nDead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! crushed!\nHouse of life--erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house! dead even\n        then;\nMonths, years, an echoing, garnished house-but dead, dead, dead!\n\n\n\n_TO ONE SHORTLY TO DIE._\n\n\n1.\n\nFrom all the rest I single out you, having a message for you:\nYou are to die--Let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,\nI am exact and merciless, but I love you--There is no escape for you.\n\n\n2.\n\nSoftly I lay my right hand upon you--you just feel it;\nI do not argue--I bend my head close, and half envelop it,\nI sit quietly by--I remain faithful,\nI am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbour,\nI absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodily--that is\n        eternal,--\nThe corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.\n\nThe sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions!\nStrong thoughts fill you, and confidence--you smile!\nYou forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,\nYou do not see the medicines--you do not mind the weeping friends--I am\n        with you,\nI exclude others from you--there is nothing to be commiserated,\nI do not commiserate--I congratulate you.\n\n\n\n_UNNAMED LANDS._\n\n\n1.\n\nNations, ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten\n        thousand years before these States;\nGarnered clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and travelled\n        their course, and passed on;\nWhat vast-built cities--what orderly republics--what pastoral tribes and\n        nomads;\nWhat histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others;\nWhat laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions;\nWhat sort of marriage--what costumes--what physiology and phrenology;\nWhat of liberty and slavery among them--what they thought of death and the\n        soul;\nWho were witty and wise--who beautiful and poetic--who brutish and\n        undeveloped;\nNot a mark, not a record remains,--And yet all remains.\n\n\n2.\n\nO I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we\n        are for nothing;\nI know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we\n        now belong to it, and as all will henceforth belong to it.\n\nAfar they stand--yet near to me they stand,\nSome with oval countenances, learned and calm,\nSome naked and savage--Some like huge collections of insects,\nSome in tents--herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,\nSome prowling through woods--Some living peaceably on farms, labouring,\n        reaping, filling barns,\nSome traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries,\n        shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.\n\nAre those billions of men really gone?\nAre those women of the old experience of the earth gone?\nDo their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?\nDid they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?\n\n\n3.\n\nI believe, of all those billions of men and women that filled the unnamed\n        lands, every one exists this hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to\n        us, in exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and\n        out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinned, in life.\n\nI believe that was not the end of those nations, or any person of them, any\n        more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;\nOf their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games,\n        wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets, I suspect\n        their results curiously await in the yet unseen world--counterparts\n        of what accrued to them in the seen world;\nI suspect I shall meet them there,\nI suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.\n\n\n\n_SIMILITUDE._\n\n\n1.\n\nOn the beach at night alone,\nAs the old Mother sways her to and fro, singing her savage and husky song,\nAs I watch the bright stars shining--I think a thought of the clef of the\n        universes, and of the future.\n\n\n2.\n\nA VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,\nAll spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, comets,\n        asteroids,\nAll the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the same,\nAll distances of place, however wide,\nAll distances of time--all inanimate forms,\nAll Souls--all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in\n        different worlds,\nAll gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the brutes,\nAll men and women--me also;\nAll nations, colours, barbarisms, civilisations, languages;\nAll identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any\n        globe;\nAll lives and deaths--all of the past, present, future;\nThis vast similitude spans them, and always has spanned, and shall for ever\n        span them, and compactly hold them.\n\n\n\n_THE SQUARE DEIFIC._\n\n\nGOD.\n\nChanting the Square Deific, out of the One advancing, out of the sides;\nOut of the old and new--out of the square entirely divine,\nSolid, four-sided, (all the sides needed)--From this side JEHOVAH am I,\nOld Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;\nNot Time affects me--I am Time, modern as any;\nUnpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments;\nAs the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,\nAged beyond computation--yet ever new--ever with those mighty laws rolling,\nRelentless, I forgive no man--whoever sins dies--I will have that man's\n        life;\nTherefore let none expect mercy--Have the seasons, gravitation, the\n        appointed days, mercy?--No more have I;\nBut as the seasons, and gravitation--and as all the appointed days, that\n        forgive not,\nI dispense from this side judgments inexorable, without the least remorse.\n\n\nSAVIOUR.\n\nConsolator most mild, the promised one advancing,\nWith gentle hand extended, the mightier God am I,\nForetold by prophets and poets, in their most wrapt prophecies and poems;\nFrom this side, lo! the Lord CHRIST gazes--lo! Hermes I--lo! mine is\n        Hercules' face;\nAll sorrow, labour, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself;\nMany times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and crucified--and\n        many times shall be again;\nAll the world have I given up for my dear brothers' and sisters' sake--for\n        the soul's sake;\nWending my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with the kiss of\n        affection;\nFor I am affection--I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope, and all-\n        enclosing charity;\nConqueror yet--for before me all the armies and soldiers of the earth shall\n        yet bow--and all the weapons of war become impotent:\nWith indulgent words, as to children--with fresh and sane words, mine only;\nYoung and strong I pass, knowing well I am destined myself to an early\n        death:\nBut my Charity has no death--my Wisdom dies not, neither early nor late,\nAnd my sweet Love, bequeathed here and elsewhere, never dies.\n\n\nSATAN.\n\nAloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,\nComrade of criminals, brother of slaves,\nCrafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,\nWith sudra face and worn brow--black, but in the depths of my heart proud\n        as any;\nLifted, now and always, against whoever, scorning, assumes to rule me;\nMorose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,\nThough it was thought I was baffled and dispelled, and my wiles done--but\n        that will never be;\nDefiant I SATAN still live--still utter words--in new lands duly appearing,\n        and old ones also;\nPermanent here, from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,\nNor time, nor change, shall ever change me or my words.\n\n\nTHE SPIRIT.\n\nSanta SPIRITA,[1] breather, life,\nBeyond the light, lighter than light,\nBeyond the flames of hell--joyous, leaping easily above hell;\nBeyond Paradise--perfumed solely with mine own perfume;\nIncluding all life on earth--touching, including God--including Saviour and\n        Satan;\nEthereal, pervading all--for, without me, what were all? what were God?\nEssence of forms--life of the real identities, permanent, positive, namely\n        the unseen,\nLife of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man--I, the\n        General Soul,\nHere the Square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,\nBreathe my breath also through these little songs.\n\n[Footnote 1: The reader will share my wish that Whitman had written\n_sanctus spiritus_, which is right, instead of _santa spirita_, which is\nmethodically wrong.]\n\n\n\n\n_SONGS OF PARTING._\n\n\n\n_SINGERS AND POETS._\n\n\n1.\n\nThe indications and tally of time;\nPerfect sanity shows the master among philosophs;\nTime, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts;\nWhat always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of\n        singers, and their words;\nThe words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark--but\nthe words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark;\nThe maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\nHis insight and power encircle things and the human race,\nHe is the glory and extract, thus far, of things and of the human race.\n\n\n2.\n\nThe singers do not beget--only the POET begets;\nThe singers are welcomed, understood, appear often enough--but rare has the\nday been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems;\nNot every century, or every five centuries, has contained such a day, for\n        all its names.\nThe singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, but\n        the name of each of them is one of the singers;\nThe name of each is eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\nsweet-singer, echo-singer, parlour-singer, love-singer, or something else.\n\n\n3.\n\nAll this time, and at all times, wait the words of poems;\nThe greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and\n        fathers;\nThe words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\n\nDivine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of\n        body, withdrawnness, gaiety, sun-tan, air-sweetness--such are some\n        of the words of poems.\n\n\n4.\n\nThe sailor and traveller underlie the maker of poems,\nThe builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist--all these\n        underlie the maker of poems.\n\n\n5.\n\nThe words of the true poems give you more than poems,\nThey give you, to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war,\n        peace, behaviour, histories, essays, romances, and everything else,\nThey balance ranks, colours, races, creeds, and the sexes,\nThey do not seek beauty--they are sought,\nFor ever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing, fain,\n        love-sick.\nThey prepare for death--yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\nThey bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full;\nWhom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars, to\n        learn one of the meanings,\nTo launch off with absolute faith--to sweep through the ceaseless rings,\n        and never be quiet again.\n\n\n\n_TO A HISTORIAN._\n\n\nYou who celebrate bygones:\nWho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races--the life that has\n        exhibited itself;\nWho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers,\n        and priests.\nI, habitué of the Alleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own\n        rights,\nPressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, the great\n        pride of man in himself;\nChanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be;\nI project the history of the future.\n\n\n\n_FIT AUDIENCE._\n\n\n1.\n\nWhoever you are, holding me now in hand,\nWithout one thing, all will be useless:\nI give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,\nI am not what you supposed, but far different.\n\n\n2.\n\nWho is he that would become my follower?\nWho would sign himself a candidate for my affections?\n\nThe way is suspicious--the result uncertain, perhaps destructive;\nYou would have to give up all else--I alone would expect to be your God,\n        sole and exclusive;\nYour novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,\nThe whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives around\n        you, would have to be abandoned;\nTherefore release me now, before troubling yourself any further--Let go\n        your hand from my shoulders,\nPut me down, and depart on your way.\n\nOr else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,\nOr back of a rock, in the open air,\n(For in any roofed room of a house I emerge not--nor in company,\nAnd in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)\nBut just possibly with you on a high hill--first watching lest any person,\n        for miles around, approach unawares--\nOr possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or some\n        quiet island,\nHere to put your lips upon mine I permit you,\nWith the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or the new husband's kiss,\nFor I am the new husband, and I am the comrade.\n\nOr, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,\nWhere I may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip,\nCarry me when you go forth over land or sea;\nFor thus, merely touching you, is enough--is best,\nAnd thus, touching you, would I silently sleep, and be carried eternally.\n\n\n3.\n\nBut these leaves conning, you con at peril,\nFor these leaves, and me, you will not understand,\nThey will elude you at first, and still more afterward--I will certainly\n        elude you,\nEven while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!\nAlready you see I have escaped from you.\n\nFor it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,\nNor is it by reading it you will acquire it,\nNor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,\nNor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove\n        victorious,\nNor will my poems do good only--they will do just as much evil, perhaps\n        more;\nFor all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not\n        hit--that which I hinted at;\nTherefore release me, and depart on your way.\n\n\n\n_SINGING IN SPRING._\n\nThese I, singing in spring, collect for lovers:\nFor who but I should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy?\nAnd who but I should be the poet of comrades?\nCollecting, I traverse the garden, the world--but soon I pass the gates,\nNow along the pond-side--now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,\nNow by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones thrown there, picked\n        from the fields, have accumulated,\nWild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly\n        cover them--Beyond these I pass,\nFar, far in the forest, before I think where I go,\nSolitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence;\nAlone, I had thought--yet soon a silent troop gathers around me;\nSome walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,\nThey, the spirits of friends, dead or alive--thicker they come, a great\n        crowd, and I in the middle,\nCollecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them,\nPlucking something for tokens--tossing toward whoever is near me.\nHere lilac, with a branch of pine,\nHere, out of my pocket, some moss which I pulled off a live-oak in Florida,\n        as it hung trailing down,\nHere some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,\nAnd here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pond-side,\n(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me--and returns again, never to\n        separate from me,\nAnd this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades--this Calamus-\n        root[1] shall,\nInterchange it, youths, with each other! Let none render it back!)\nAnd twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,\nAnd stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,\nThese I, compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,\nWandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,\nIndicating to each one what he shall have--giving something to each.\nBut what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve;\nI will give of it--but only to them that love as I myself am capable of\n        loving.\n\n[Footnote 1: I am favoured with the following indication, from Mr Whitman\nhimself, of the relation in which this word Calamus is to be\nunderstood:--\"Calamus is the very large and aromatic grass or rush growing\nabout water-ponds in the valleys--spears about three feet high; often\ncalled Sweet Flag; grows all over the Northern and Middle States. The\n_recherché_ or ethereal sense of the term, as used in my book, arises\nprobably from the actual Calamus presenting the biggest and hardiest kind\nof spears of grass, and their fresh, aquatic, pungent _bouquet_.\"]\n\n\n\n_LOVE OF COMRADES._\n\n\n1.\n\nCome, I will make the continent indissoluble;\nI will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon!\nI will make divine magnetic lands,\n        With the love of comrades,\n          With the life-long love of comrades.\n\n\n2.\n\nI will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America,\n        and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies;\nI will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each other's necks;\n        By the love of comrades,\n          By the manly love of comrades.\n\n\n3.\n\nFor you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you, _ma femme_!\nFor you! for you, I am trilling these songs,\n        In the love of comrades,\n          In the high-towering love of comrades.\n\n\n\n_PULSE OF MY LIFE._\n\nNot heaving from my ribbed breast only;\nNot in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;\nNot in those long-drawn, ill-suppressed sighs;\nNot in many an oath and promise broken;\nNot in my wilful and savage soul's volition;\nNot in the subtle nourishment of the air;\nNot in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists;\nNot in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day cease;\nNot in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;\nNot in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in the\n        wilds;\nNot in husky pantings through clenched teeth;\nNot in sounded and resounded words--chattering words, echoes, dead words;\nNot in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,\nNor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day;\nNor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you\n        continually--Not there;\nNot in any or all of them, O Adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!\nNeed I that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these songs.\n\n\n\n_AUXILIARIES._\n\n\nWHAT place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\nLo! I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal;\nAnd with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,\nAnd artillerymen, the deadliest that ever fired gun.\n\n\n\n_REALITIES._\n\n\n1.\n\nAs I walk, solitary, unattended,\nAround me I hear that _éclat_ of the world--politics, produce,\nThe announcements of recognised things--science,\nThe approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions.\n\nI see the ships, (they will last a few years,)\nThe vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,\nAnd hear the endorsement of all, and do not object to it.\n\n\n2.\n\nBut I too announce solid things;\nScience, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing--they serve,\nThey stand for realities--all is as it should be.\n\n\n3.\n\nThen my realities;\nWhat else is so real as mine?\nLibertad, and the divine Average-Freedom to every slave on the face of the\n        earth,\nThe rapt promises and _luminé_[1] of seers--the spiritual\n        world--these centuries-lasting songs,\nAnd our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements of any.\n\nFor we support all,\nAfter the rest is done and gone, we remain,\nThere is no final reliance but upon us;\nDemocracy rests finally upon us, (I, my brethren, begin it,)\nAnd our visions sweep through eternity.\n\n[Footnote 1: I suppose Whitman gets this odd word _luminé_, by a process of\nhis own, out of _illuminati_, and intends it to stand for what would be\ncalled clairvoyance, intuition.]\n\n\n\n_NEARING DEPARTURE._\n\n\n1.\n\nAs nearing departure,\nAs the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,\nA dread beyond, of I know not what, darkens me.\n\n\n2.\n\nI shall _go_ forth,\nI shall traverse the States--but I cannot tell whither or how long;\nPerhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing, my voice will suddenly\n        cease.\n\n\n3.\n\nO book and chant! must all then amount to but this?\nMust we barely arrive at this beginning of me?...\nAnd yet it is enough, O soul!\nO soul! we have positively appeared--that is enough.\n\n\n\n_POETS TO COME._\n\n\n1.\n\nPoets to come!\nNot to-day is to justify me, and Democracy, and what we are for;\nBut you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before\n        known,\nYou must justify me.\n\n\n2.\n\nI but write one or two indicative words for the future,\nI but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.\n\nI am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a casual\n        look upon you, and then averts his face,\nLeaving it to you to prove and define it,\nExpecting the main things from you.\n\n\n\n_CENTURIES HENCE._\n\n\nFull of life now, compact, visible,\nI, forty years old the eighty-third year of the States,\nTo one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,\nTo you, yet unborn, these seeking you.\n\nWhen you read these, I, that was visible, am become invisible;\nNow it is you, compact, visible, realising my poems, seeking me;\nFancying how happy you were, if I could be with you, and become your loving\n        comrade;\nBe it as if I were with you. Be not too certain but I am now with you.\n\n\n\n_SO LONG!_\n\n\n1.\n\nTo conclude--I announce what comes after me;\nI announce mightier offspring, orators, days, and then depart,\n\nI remember I said, before my leaves sprang at all,\nI would raise my voice jocund and strong, with reference to consummations.\n\nWhen America does what was promised,\nWhen there are plentiful athletic bards, inland and sea-board,\nWhen through these States walk a hundred millions of superb persons,\nWhen the rest part away for superb persons, and contribute to them,\nWhen breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,\nThen to me my due fruition.\n\nI have pressed through in my own right,\nI have offered my style to every one--I have journeyed with confident step.\nWhile my pleasure is yet at the full, I whisper, _So long_!\nAnd take the young woman's hand, and the young man's hand for the last\n        time.\n\n\n2.\n\nI announce natural persons to arise,\nI announce justice triumphant,\nI announce uncompromising liberty and equality,\nI announce the justification of candour, and the justification of pride.\n\nI announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only,\nI announce the Union, out of all its struggles and wars, more and more\n        compact,\nI announce splendours and majesties to make all the previous politics of\n        the earth insignificant.\n\nI announce a man or woman coming--perhaps you are the one (_So long_!)\nI announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste, affectionate,\n        compassionate, fully armed.\nI announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,\nAnd I announce an old age that shall lightly and joyfully meet its\n        translation.\n\n\n3.\n\nO thicker and faster! (_So long_!)\nO crowding too close upon me;\nI foresee too much--it means more than I thought,\nIt appears to me I am dying.\n\nHasten throat, and sound your last!\nSalute me--salute the days once more. Peal the old cry once more.\n\nScreaming electric, the atmosphere using,\nAt random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,\nSwiftly on, but a little while alighting,\nCurious enveloped messages delivering,\nSparkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,\nMyself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never daring,\nTo ages, and ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,\nTo troops out of me rising--they the tasks I have set promulging,\nTo women certain whispers of myself bequeathing--their affection me more\nclearly explaining,\nTo young men my problems offering--no dallier I--I the muscle of their\n        brains trying,\nSo I pass--a little time vocal, visible, contrary,\nAfterward, a melodious echo, passionately bent for--death making me really\n        undying,--\nThe best of me then when no longer visible--for toward that I have been\nincessantly preparing.\n\nWhat is there more, that I lag and pause, and crouch extended with unshut\n        mouth?\nIs there a single final farewell?\n\n\n4.\n\nMy songs cease--I abandon them,\nFrom behind the screen where I hid, I advance personally, solely to you.\n\nCamerado! This is no book;\nWho touches this touches a man.\n(Is it night? Are we here alone?)\nIt is I you hold, and who holds you,\nI spring from the pages into your arms--decease calls me forth.\n\nO how your fingers drowse me!\nYour breath falls around me like dew--your pulse lulls the tympans of my\n        ears,\nI feel immerged from head to foot,\nDelicious--enough.\n\nEnough, O deed impromptu and secret!\nEnough, O gliding present! Enough, O summed-up past!\n\n\n5.\n\n\nDear friend, whoever you are, here, take this kiss,\nI give it especially to you--Do not forget me,\n\nI feel like one who has done his work--I progress on,--(long enough have I\n        dallied with Life,)\nThe unknown sphere, more real than I dreamed, more direct, awakening rays\n        about me--_So long_!\nRemember my words--I love you--I depart from materials,\nI am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.\n\n\n\n\nPOSTSCRIPT.\n\nWhile this Selection was passing through the press, it has been my\nprivilege to receive two letters from Mr. Whitman, besides another\ncommunicated to me through a friend. I find my experience to be the same as\nthat of some previous writers: that, if one admires Whitman in reading his\nbooks, one loves him on coming into any personal relation with him--even\nthe comparatively distant relation of letter-writing.\n\nThe more I have to thank the poet for the substance and tone of his\nletters, and some particular expressions in them, the more does it become\nincumbent upon me to guard against any misapprehension. He has had nothing\nwhatever to do with this Selection, as to either prompting, guiding, or\neven ratifying it: except only that he did not prohibit my making two or\nthree verbal omissions in the _Prose Preface to the Leaves of Grass_, and\nhe has supplied his own title, _President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn_, to a\npoem which, in my Prefatory Notice, is named (by myself) _Nocturn for the\nDeath of Lincoln_. All admirers of his poetry will rejoice to learn that\nthere is no longer any doubt of his adding to his next edition \"a brief\ncluster of pieces born of thoughts on the deep themes of Death and\nImmortality.\" A new American edition will be dear to many: a complete\nEnglish edition ought to be an early demand of English poetic readers, and\nwould be the right and crowning result of the present Selection.\n\nW.

A universal astonishment and confusion fell, as upon a flock\nof sheep perplexed by strange dogs. But now, though never before was a\nSt. Lucy's Day so black with \"absence, darkness, death,\" Christmas is\ngone. Spring comes swiftly, the almond trees flourish. Easter will soon\nbe here. Life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring\nhell itself into the world, but that Nature ever patiently waits to be\nhis natural paradise. Yet still a kind of instinctive blindness blots out\nthe prospect of the future. Until the long horror of the war is gone from\nour minds, we shall be able to think of nothing that has not for its\nbackground a chaotic darkness. Like every obsession, it gnaws at thought,\nfollows us into our dreams and returns with the morning. But there have\nbeen other wars. And humanity, after learning as best it may their brutal\nlesson, has survived them. Just as the young soldier leaves home behind\nhim and accepts hardship and danger as to the manner born, so, when he\nreturns again, life will resume its old quiet wont. Nature is not idle\neven in the imagination. It is man's salvation to forget no less than it\nis his salvation to remember. And it is wise even in the midst of the\nconflict to look back on those that are past and to prepare for the\nreturning problems of the future.\n\nWhen Whitman wrote his \"Democratic Vistas,\" the long embittered war\nbetween the Northern and Southern States of America was a thing only of\nyesterday. It is a headlong amorphous production--a tangled meadow of\n\"leaves of grass\" in prose. But it is as cogent to-day as it was when it\nwas written:\n\n    To the ostent of the senses and eyes [he writes], the influences\n    which stamp the world's history are wars, uprisings, or downfalls\n    of dynasties.... These, of course, play their part; yet, it may\n    be, a single new thought, imagination, abstract principle ... put\n    in shape by some great literatus, and projected among mankind,\n    may duly cause changes, growths, removals, greater than the\n    longest and bloodiest war, or the most stupendous merely\n    political, dynastic, or commercial overturn.\n\nThe literatus who realized this had his own message in mind. And yet,\njustly. For those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material\ncomforts of his country, and ask, Are not these better indeed than any\nutterances even of greatest rhapsodic, artist, or literatus? he has his\nirrefutable answer. He surveys the New York of 1870, \"its facades of\nmarble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design,\" etc., in\nhis familiar catalogical jargon, and shutting his eyes to its glow and\ngrandeur, inquires in return, Are there indeed _men_ here worthy the\nname? Are there perfect women? Is there a pervading atmosphere of\nbeautiful manners? Are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people? Is\nthere a great moral and religious civilization--the only justification of\na great material one? We ourselves in good time shall have to face and to\nanswer these questions. They search our keenest hopes of the peace that\nis coming. And we may be fortified perhaps by the following queer proof\nof history repeating itself:\n\n    Never, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholster'd exterior\n    appearance and show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea\n    of caste, and on the sufficiency of mere outside\n    acquisition--never were glibness, verbal intellect, more the\n    test, the emulation--more loftily elevated as head and sample--\n    than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day.\n    The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods. The word of\n    the modern, say these voices, is the word Culture.\n\nWhitman had no very tender regard for the Germany of his time. He fancied\nthat the Germans were like the Chinese, only less graceful and refined\nand more brutish. But neither had he any particular affection for any\nrelic of Europe. \"Never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract\nfriendliness of a single _Government_ of the Old World.\" He accepted\nselections from its literature for the new American Adam. But even its\ngreatest poets were not America's, and though he might welcome even\nJuvenal, it was for use and not for worship. We have to learn, he\ninsists, that the best culture will always be that of the manly and\ncourageous instincts and loving perceptions, and of self-respect. In our\nchildren rests every hope and promise, and therefore in their mothers.\n\"Disengage yourselves from parties.... These savage and wolfish parties\nalarm me.... Hold yourself judge and master over all of them.\" Only faith\ncan save us, the faith in ourselves and in our fellow-men which is of the\ntrue faith in goodness and in God. The idea of the mass of men, so fresh\nand free, so loving and so proud, filled this poet with a singular awe.\nPassionately he pleads for the dignity of the common people. It is the\naverage man of a land that is important. To win the people back to a\nproud belief and confidence in life, to rapture in this wonderful world,\nto love and admiration--this was his burning desire. I demand races of\norbic bards, he rhapsodizes, sweet democratic despots, to dominate and\neven destroy. The Future! Vistas! The throes of birth are upon us.\nAllons, camarado!\n\nHe could not despair. \"Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of\nthe baffled?\" he asks himself in \"Drum-Taps.\" But wildest shuttlecock of\ncriticism though he is, he has never yet been charged with looking only\non the dark side of things. Once, he says, \"Once, before the war (alas! I\ndare not say how many times the mood has come!), I too, was fill'd with\ndoubt and gloom.\" His part in it soothed, mellowed, deepened his great\nnature. He had himself witnessed such misery, cruelty, and abomination as\nit is best just now, perhaps, not to read about. One fact alone is\nenough; that over fifty thousand Federal soldiers perished of starvation\nin Southern prisons. Malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had\nwrecked his health. During 1862-65 he visited, he says, eighty to a\nhundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers, comprehending all, slighting\nnone. Rebel or compatriot, it made no difference. \"I loved the young\nman,\" he cries again and again. Pity and fatherliness were in his face,\nfor his heart was full of them. Mr. Gosse has described \"the old Gray\" as\nhe saw him in 1884, in his bare, littered sun-drenched room in Camden,\nshared by kitten and canary:\n\n    He sat with a very curious pose of the head thrown backward, as\n    if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than\n    other people do, and thus tilting his face a little upwards. With\n    his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of\n    the interlocutor he seemed to pass into a state of absolute\n    passivity ... the glassy eyes half closed, the large knotted\n    hands spread out before him. He resembled, in fact, nothing so\n    much as \"a great old grey Angora Tom,\" alert in repose, serenely\n    blinking under his combed waves of hair, with eyes inscrutably\n    dreaming.... As I stood in dull, deserted Mickle Street once\n    more, my heart was full of affection for this beautiful old man\n    ... this old rhapsodist in his empty room, glorified by patience\n    and philosophy.\n\nWhitman was then sixty-five. In a portrait of thirty years before there\nis just a wraith of that feline dream, perhaps, but it is a face of a\nrare grace and beauty that looks out at us, of a profound kindness and\ncompassion. And, in the eyes, not so much penetration as visionary\nabsorption. Such was the man to whom nothing was unclean, nothing too\ntrivial (except \"pale poetlings lisping cadenzas _piano_,\" who then\napparently thronged New York) to take to himself. Intensest,\nindomitablest of individualists, he exulted in all that appertains to\nthat forked radish, Man. This contentious soul of mine, he exclaims\necstatically; Viva: the attack! I have been born the same as the war was\nborn; I lull nobody, and you will never understand me: maybe I am\nnon-literary and un-decorous.... I have written impromptu, and shall let\nit all go at that. Let me at least be human! Human, indeed, he was, a\ntender, all-welcoming host of Everyman, of his idolized (if somewhat\noverpowering) American democracy. Man in the street, in his swarms, poor\ncrazed faces in the State asylum, prisoners in Sing Sing, prostitute,\nwhose dead body reminded him not of a lost soul, but only of a sad,\nforlorn, and empty house--it mattered not; he opened his heart to them,\none and all. \"I see beyond each mark that wonder, a kindred soul. O the\nbullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend.\"\n\n  The moon gives you light,\n  And the bugles and drums give you music,\n  And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,\n  My heart gives you love.\n\n\"Yours for you,\" he exclaims, welding in a phrase his unparalleled\negotism, his beautiful charity, \"yours for you, who ever you are, as mine\nfor me.\" It is the essence of philosophy and of religion, for all the\nwonders of heaven and earth are significant \"only because of the Me in\nthe centre.\"\n\nThis was the secret of his tender, unassuming ministrations. He had none\nof that shrinking timidity, that fear of intrusion, that uneasiness in\nthe presence of the tragic and the pitiful, which so often numb and\noppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the\nneedy and suffering, but whose intellect misgives them. He was that\nformidable phenomenon, a dreamer of action. But he possessed a sovran\ngood sense. Food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous\npreparation for his visits. He always assumed as cheerful an appearance\nas possible. Armed with bright new five-cent and ten-cent bills (the\nwounded, he found, were often \"broke,\" and the sight of a little money\n\"helped their spirits\"), with books and stationery and tobacco, for one a\ntwist of good strong green tea, for another a good home-made\nrice-pudding, or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry\nsyrup, a small bottle of horse-radish pickle, or a large handsome apple,\nhe would \"make friends.\" \"What I have I also give you,\" he cried from the\nbottom of his grieved, tempestuous heart. He would talk, or write\nletters--passionate love-letters, too--or sit silent, in mute and tender\nkindness. \"Long, long, I gazed ... leaning my chin in my hands, passing\nsweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade--not a\ntear, not a word, Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son\nand my soldier.\" And how many a mother must have blessed the stranger who\ncould bring such last news of a son as this: \"And now like many other\nnoble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has\nyielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things\nare gloomy--yet there is a text, 'God doeth all things well'--the meaning\nof which, after due time, appears to the soul.\" It is only love that can\ncomfort the loving.\n\nHe forced nothing on these friends of a day, so many of them near their\nlast farewell. A poor wasted young man asks him to read a chapter in the\nNew Testament, and Whitman chooses that which describes Christ's\nCrucifixion. He \"ask'd me to read the following chapter also, how Christ\nrose again. I read very slowly, for he was feeble. It pleased him very\nmuch, yet the tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd religion.\nI said 'Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, yet maybe, it is the\nsame thing.'\" This is only one of many such serene intimacies in\nWhitman's experiences of the war. Through them we reach to an\nunderstanding of a poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out\nof the past, nor the rare moments of existence, for theme, but took all\nlife, within and around him in vast bustling America, for his poetic\nprovince. Like a benign barbaric sun he surveys the world, ever at noon.\nI am the man, I suffer'd, I was there, he cries in the \"Song of Myself.\"\nI do not despise you priests, all times, the world over.... He could not\ndespise anything, not even his fellow-poets, because he himself was\neverything. His verse sometimes seems mere verbiage, but it is always a\nhiggledy-piggledy, Santa Claus bagful of _things_. And he could penetrate\nto the essential reality. He tells in his \"Drum-Taps\" how one daybreak he\narose in camp, and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern\nradiance, how with light fingers he just lifted the blanket from each\ncold face in turn: the first elderly, gaunt, and grim--Who are you, my\ndear comrade? The next with cheeks yet blooming--Who are you, sweet boy?\nThe third--Young man, I think I know you. I think this face is the face\nof the Christ Himself, Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again\nhe lies.\n\nTrue poetry focuses experience, not merely transmits it. It must redeem\nit for ever from transitoriness and evanescence. Whitman incontinently\npours experience out in a Niagara-like cataract. But in spite of his\nhabitual publicity he was at heart of a \"shy, brooding, impassioned\ndevotional type\"; in spite of his self-conscious, arrogant virility, he\nwas to the end of his life an entranced child. He came into the world,\nsaw and babbled. His deliberate method of writing could have had no other\nissue. A subject would occur to him, a kind of tag. He would scribble it\ndown on a scrap of paper and drop it into a drawer. Day by day this first\nimpulse would evoke fresh \"poemets,\" until at length the accumulation was\nexhaustive. Then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete.\nIt was only when sense and feeling attained a sort of ecstasy that he\nsucceeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping\nit in a crystal phial of form.\n\nThe prose of his \"Specimen Days,\" indeed, is often nearer to poetry than\nhis verse:\n\n    Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps.... I often come and\n    sit by him in perfect silence; he will breathe for ten minutes as\n    softly and evenly as a young babe asleep. Poor youth, so\n    handsome, athletic, with profuse beautiful shining hair. One time\n    as I sat looking at him while he lay asleep, he suddenly, without\n    the least start awaken'd, open'd his eyes, gave me a long steady\n    look, turning his face very slightly to gaze easier--one long,\n    clear, silent look--a slight sigh--then turn'd back and went into\n    his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken boy, the\n    heart of the stranger that hover'd near.\n\n    The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening has\n    never been so large, so clear; it seems as if it told something,\n    as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans.\n    The sky dark blue, the transparent night, the planets, the\n    moderate west wind, the elastic temperature, the miracle of that\n    great star, and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west,\n    suffused the soul. Then I heard slow and clear the deliberate\n    notes of a bugle come up out of the silence ... firm and\n    faithful, floating along, rising, falling leisurely, with here\n    and there a long-drawn note.... sounding tattoo.\n\n\"A steady rain, dark and thick and warm,\" he writes again, two days after\nGettysburg. \"The cavalry camp is a ceaseless field of observation to me.\nThis forenoon there stood the horses, tether'd together, dripping,\nsteaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping\nalso. The fires are half-quench'd.\" There is a poetic poise in this\nbrief, vivid statement, apart from its bare economy of means. It is the\nlump awaiting the leaven no less than is \"Cavalry Crossing a Ford.\" To\nthis supreme spectator an apple orchard in May, even the White House in\nmoonlight, no more and no less than these battle-scenes, rendered up\ntheir dignity, life, and beauty, their true human significance. But in\n\"Drum-Taps\" the witness is not always so satisfactory. The secret has\nevaporated in the effort to _make_ poetry, or half-consciously to inject\na moral, to play the Universal Bard. There creeps into the words a tinge\nof the raw and the grotesque. The poet has the look of a cowboy off the\nstage, tanned with grease-paint. But again and again the secret creeps\nback and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it:\n\n  Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,\n  Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,\n            purple,\n  On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,\n  Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.\n\nOr this, called \"Reconciliation\":\n\n  Word over all, beautiful as the sky,\n  Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be\n            utterly lost,\n  That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash\n            again, and ever again, this soil'd world;\n  For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,\n  I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw\n            near,\n  Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the\n            coffin.\n\nThe bonds of rhyme shackled him, deprived him of more than freedom. He is\nlike a wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage\nacross the blue of the sky. And yet the finer his poems are, the nearer\nthey approach to definite rhythmical design. One has only to compare \"O\nCaptain! my Captain!\" with \"Hushed be the Camps To-day\" to perceive this\ncurious paradox. They are both of them memories of his beloved Lincoln,\nwhom he had many times seen, with that peculiarly close and transatlantic\ncuriosity of his, riding at a jog-trot, on a good-sized, easy-going grey\nhorse, with his escort of yellow-striped cavalry behind him, through the\nstreets of Washington--dressed in black, somewhat rusty and dusty, with a\nblack, stiff hat, almost as ordinary in attire as the commonest man. That\nheroic face, too, he had pierced; and caught from it the deep, subtle,\nindirect expression, that only the long-gone master-painters of the Old\nWorld could have seized and immortalized. And in yet another memory of\nthis great American Whitman attains to his best and highest, \"When Lilacs\nLast in the Doorway Bloom'd.\" It is one of the most beautiful of poems,\nof the purest intuition, of a consummate, if unconscious, artistry. Whose\nvoice is it that rings and echoes, now low and tender, now solemn and\ndesolate, now clear, full, victorious, out of its cloistral\nsolitude--that of the mourner himself, of all-heedfull, heedless Nature,\nof the immortal soul of man, or just a bird, the shy and hidden, sweet,\nsmall hermit thrush? The last division of his life's work--his fond Epic,\nhis cosmic \"inventory\"--as Whitman planned it, was to be devoted to the\nchaunting of songs of death and immortality. The soldier to whom he read\nof Christ's Resurrection talked of death to him, and said he did not fear\nit. He talked to a man who did not enjoy religion in the way a Christian\nmeans, to whom the mystery of Easter is an all-sufficing \"reliance.\" But\nWhitman not only did not fear death. The thought of it was to him the\nstrangest of raptures, the reverie of a child dreaming of a distant\nmother, soon to come again. Death and immortality were but two aspects of\nthe same blessed hope to this man, who poured out his life in a turgid\nfount of ecstatic joy in living:\n\n  ... And I saw askant the armies,\n  I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\n  Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I\n            saw them,\n  And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\n  And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),\n  And the staffs all splintered and broken.\n\n  I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\n  And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\n  I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\n  But I saw they were not as was thought,\n  They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,\n  The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,\n  And the wives and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,\n  And the armies that remain'd suffer'd....\n\n  _Come lovely and soothing death,\n  Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\n  In the night, in the day, to all, to each,\n  Sooner or later delicate death._\n\n  _Prais'd be the fathomless universe,\n  For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\n  And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!\n  For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death._\n\n  _Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet\n  Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\n  Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\n  I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come\n            unfalteringly._\n\n\n\n\n\nDRUM-TAPS\n\n\n\n\nFIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE.\n\n\n  First O songs for a prelude,\n  Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,\n  How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,\n  How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,\n  (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!\n  O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than\n            steel!)\n  How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with\n            indifferent hand,\n  How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard\n            in their stead,\n  How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of\n            soldiers,)\n  How Manhattan drum-taps led.\n\n  Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,\n  Forty years as a pageant, still unawares the lady of this teeming and\n            turbulent city,\n  Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,\n  With her million children around her, suddenly,\n  At dead of night, at news from the south,\n  Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.\n\n  A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,\n  Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.\n  From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,\n  Leapt they tumultuous, and lo!

_Volunteer of 1861-2, (at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting the\n            Centenarian.)_\n\n  Give me your hand old Revolutionary,\n  The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)\n  Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and\n            extra years,\n  You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,\n  Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.\n  Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,\n  On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,\n  There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,\n  Do you hear the officers giving their orders?\n  Do you hear the clank of the muskets?\n\n  Why what comes over you now old man?\n  Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?\n  The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles.\n  Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,\n  While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,\n  Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\n  O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.\n  But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,\n  Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\n\n  As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,\n  Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,\n  You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\n\n  _The Centenarian._\n\n  When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,\n  But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,\n  And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they\n            ran,\n  And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and\n            south-east and south-west,\n  Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,\n  And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and\n            suddenly raged,\n  As eighty-five years a-gone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of\n            friends,\n  But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is I\n            took part in it,\n  Walking then this hill-top, this same ground.\n\n  Aye, this is the ground,\n  My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,\n  The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,\n  Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,\n  I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,\n  I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\n  Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.\n\n  As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\n  It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\n  By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up\n            his unsheath'd sword,\n  It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.\n\n  'Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,\n  We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\n  And the transports swarming with soldiers.\n\n  A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\n\n  Twenty thousand were brought against us,\n  A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.\n  I tell not now the whole of the battle,\n  But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the\n            red-coats,\n  Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,\n  And how long and well it stood confronting death.\n\n  Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting\n            death?\n  It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\n  Raised in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to\n            the General.\n\n  Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,\n  Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at\n            night,\n  The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\n            their guns,\n  That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.\n\n  The General watch'd them from this hill,\n  They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\n  They drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the\n            middle,\n  But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\n\n  It sickens me yet, that slaughter!\n  I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\n  I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\n\n  Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,\n  But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.\n\n  We fought the fight in detachments.\n  Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\n            against us,\n  Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to\n            the works on this hill,\n  Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.\n\n  That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two\n            thousand strong,\n  Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\n  That and here my General's first battle,\n  No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with\n            applause,\n  Nobody clapp'd hands here then.\n\n  But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\n  Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,\n  While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord oft' against us\n            encamp'd,\n  Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\n            their victory.\n\n  So dull and damp and another day,\n  But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\n  Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\n            General retreated.\n\n  I saw him at the river-side,\n  Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\n  My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,\n  And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the\n            last time.\n\n  Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,\n  Many no doubt thought of capitulation.\n\n  But when my General pass'd me,\n  As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,\n  I saw something different from capitulation.\n\n  _Terminus._\n\n  Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,\n  The two, the past and present, have interchanged,\n  I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now\n            speaking.\n\n  And is this the ground Washington trod?\n  And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he\n            cross'd,\n  As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\n\n  I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\n  I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.\n\n  See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\n  It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\n  The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\n            Washington's face,\n  The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept\n            the enemy,\n  They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\n  Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\n  Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,\n  In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.\n\n  Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable\n            than your owners supposed;\n  In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,\n  Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.\n\n\n\n\nCAVALRY CROSSING A FORD.\n\n\n  A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,\n  They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to\n            the musical clank,\n  Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop\n            to drink,\n  Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the\n            negligent rest on the saddles,\n  Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the\n            ford--while\n  Scarlet and blue and snowy white,\n  The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.\n\n\n\n\nBIVOUAC ON A MOUNTAIN SIDE.\n\n\n  I see before me now a traveling army halting,\n  Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,\n  Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising\n            high,\n  Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily\n            seen,\n  The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the\n            mountain,\n  The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized,\n            flickering,\n  And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,\n            breaking out, the eternal stars.\n\n\n\n\nAN ARMY CORPS ON THE MARCH.\n\n\n  With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,\n  With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an\n            irregular volley,\n  The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,\n  Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,\n  In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,\n  With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,\n  As the army corps advances.\n\n\n\n\nBY THE BIVOUAC'S FITFUL FLAME.\n\n\n  By the bivouac's fitful flame,\n  A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but first\n            I note,\n  The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim out-line,\n  The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,\n  Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,\n  The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily\n            watching me,)\n  While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,\n  Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that\n            are far away;\n  A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,\n  By the bivouac's fitful flame.\n\n\n\n\nCOME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER.\n\n\n  Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,\n  And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.\n\n  Lo, 'tis autumn,\n  Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,\n  Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the\n            moderate wind,\n  Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd\n            vines,\n  (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?\n  Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)\n  Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and\n            with wondrous clouds,\n  Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers\n            well.\n\n  Down in the fields all prospers well,\n  But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,\n  And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.\n\n  Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,\n  She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.\n\n  Open the envelope quickly,\n  O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,\n  O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!\n  All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main\n            words only,\n  Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,\n            taken to hospital,\n  At present low, but will soon be better._\n\n  Ah now the single figure to me,\n  Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\n  Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\n  By the jamb of a door leans.\n\n  _Grieve not so, dear mother_, (the just-grown daughter speaks through\n            her sobs,\n  The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)\n  _See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._\n\n  Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be\n            better, that brave and simple soul,)\n  While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,\n  The only son is dead.\n\n  But the mother needs to be better,\n  She with thin form presently drest in black,\n  By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often\n            waking,\n  In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,\n  O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and\n            withdraw,\n  To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.\n\n\n\n\nVIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT.\n\n\n  Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;\n  When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,\n  One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall\n            never forget,\n  One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the\n            ground,\n  Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,\n  Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my\n            way,\n  Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of\n            responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)\n  Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the\n            moderate night-wind,\n  Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the\n            battle-field spreading,\n  Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,\n  But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,\n  Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my\n            chin in my hands,\n  Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest\n            comrade--not a tear, not a word,\n  Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my\n            soldier,\n  As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,\n  Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your\n            death,\n  I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall\n            surely meet again,)\n  Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn\n            appear'd,\n  My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,\n  Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully\n            under feet,\n  And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave,\n            in his rude-dug grave I deposited,\n  Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field\n            dim,\n  Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth\n            responding,)\n  Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day\n            brighten'd,\n  I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his\n            blanket,\n  And buried him where he fell.\n\n\n\n\nA MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN.\n\n\n  A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,\n  A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,\n  Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,\n  Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted\n            building,\n  We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted\n            building,\n  'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu\n            hospital,\n  Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and\n            poems ever made,\n  Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and\n            lamps,\n  And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and\n            clouds of smoke,\n  By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in\n            the pews laid down,\n  At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of\n            bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\n  I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a\n            lily,)\n  Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it\n            all,\n  Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,\n            some of them dead,\n  Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,\n            the odor of blood,\n  The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also\n            fill'd,\n  Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\n            death-spasm sweating,\n  An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,\n  The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the\n            torches,\n  These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\n  Then hear outside the orders given, _Fall in, my men, fall in_;\n  But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives\n            he me,\n  Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\n  Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\n  The unknown road still marching.\n\n\n\n\nA SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM.\n\n\n  A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,\n  As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,\n  As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital\n            tent,\n  Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended\n            lying,\n  Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,\n  Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.\n\n  Curious I halt and silent stand,\n  Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just\n            lift the blanket;\n  Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair, and\n            flesh all sunken about the eyes?\n  Who are you my dear comrade?\n\n  Then to the second I step-and who are you my child and darling?\n  Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?\n\n  Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of\n            beautiful yellow-white ivory;\n  Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the\n            Christ himself,\n  Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.\n\n\n\n\nAS TOILSOME I WANDER'D VIRGINIA'S WOODS.\n\n\n  As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,\n  To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)\n  I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;\n  Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I\n            understand,)\n  The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose-yet this sign\n            left,\n  On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,\n  _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._\n\n  Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,\n  Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,\n  Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in\n            the crowded street,\n  Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription\n            rude in Virginia's woods,\n  _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._\n\n\n\n\nNOT THE PILOT.\n\n\n  Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,\n  though beaten back and many times baffled;\n  Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,\n  By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he\n            reaches his destination,\n  More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose a\n            march for these States,\n  For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries\n            hence.\n\n\n\n\nYEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME.\n\n\n  Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!\n  Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,\n  A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,\n  Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,\n  Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?\n  And sullen hymns of defeat?\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOUND-DRESSER.\n\n\n1\n\n  An old man bending I come among new faces,\n  Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,\n  Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,\n  (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge\n            relentless war,\n  But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,\n  To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)\n  Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these\n            chances,\n  Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally\n            brave;)\n  Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,\n  Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?\n  What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,\n  Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?\n\n2\n\n  O maidens and young men I love and that love me,\n  What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking\n            recalls,\n  Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and\n            dust,\n  In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the\n            rush of successful charge,\n  Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they\n            fade,\n  Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or\n            soldiers' joys,\n  (Both I remember well-many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was\n            content.)\n\n  But in silence, in dreams' projections,\n  While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,\n  So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the\n            sand,\n  With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up\n            there,\n  Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)\n\n  Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,\n  Straight and swift to my wounded I go,\n  Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,\n  Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,\n  Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,\n  To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,\n  To each and all one after another I drawn near, not one do I miss,\n  An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,\n  Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd\n            again.\n\n  I onward go, I stop,\n  With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,\n  I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,\n  One turns to me his appealing eyes-poor boy! I never knew you,\n  Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that\n            would save you.\n\n3\n\n  On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)\n  The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage\n            away,)\n  The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I\n            examine,\n  Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life\n            struggles hard,\n  (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!\n  In mercy come quickly.)\n\n  From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,\n  I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and\n            blood,\n  Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and\n            side-falling head,\n  His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the\n            bloody stump,\n  And has not yet look'd on it.\n\n  I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,\n  But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,\n  And the yellow-blue countenance see.\n\n  I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,\n  Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so\n            offensive,\n  While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.\n\n  I am faithful, I do not give out,\n  The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,\n  These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a\n            fire, a burning flame.)\n\n4\n\n  Thus in silence in dreams' projections,\n  Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,\n  The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,\n  I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,\n  Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,\n  (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and\n            rested,\n  Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)\n\n\n\n\nLONG, TOO LONG AMERICA.\n\n\n  Long, too long America,\n  Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and\n            prosperity only,\n  But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,\n            grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,\n  And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en-masse\n            really are,\n  (For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse\n            really are?)\n\n\n\n\nGIVE ME THE SPLENDID SILENT SUN.\n\n\n1\n\n  Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,\n  Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,\n  Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,\n  Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,\n  Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching\n            content,\n  Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the\n            Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,\n  Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can\n            walk undisturb'd,\n  Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never\n            tire,\n  Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the\n            world a rural domestic life,\n  Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own\n            ears only,\n  Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal\n            sanities!\n\n  These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and\n            rack'd by the war-strife,)\n  These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,\n  While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,\n  Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,\n  Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me up,\n  Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me forever\n            faces;\n  (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,\n  I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)\n\n2\n\n  Keep your splendid silent sun,\n  Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,\n  Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and\n            orchards,\n  Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;\n  Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and\n            endless along the trottoirs!\n  Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and lovers\n            by the thousand!\n  Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every\n            day!\n  Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!\n  Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of\n            the trumpets and drums!\n  (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush'd\n            and reckless,\n  Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very\n            old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)\n  Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!\n  O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!\n  The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!\n  The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the\n            torchlight procession!\n  The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons\n            following;\n  People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,\n  Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as\n            now,\n  The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even\n            the sight of the wounded,)\n  Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!\n  Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.\n\n\n\n\nDIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS.\n\n\n      The last sunbeam\n  Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,\n  On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,\n      Down a new-made double grave.\n\n      Lo, the moon ascending,\n  Up from the east the silvery round moon,\n  Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,\n      Immense and silent moon.\n\n      I see a sad procession,\n  And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,\n  All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,\n      As with voices and with tears.\n\n      I hear the great drums pounding,\n  And the small drums steady whirring,\n  And every blow of the great convulsive drums,\n      Strikes me through and through.\n\n      For the son is brought with the father,\n  (In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,\n  Two veterans son and father dropt together,\n      And the double grave awaits them.)\n\n      Now nearer blow the bugles,\n  And the drums strike more convulsive,\n  And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,\n      And the strong dead-march enwraps me.\n\n      In the eastern sky up-buoying,\n  The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,\n  ('Tis some mother's large transparent face,\n      In heaven brighter growing.)\n\n      O strong dead-march you please me!\n  O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!\n  O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!\n      What I have I also give you.\n\n      The moon gives you light,\n  And the bugles and the drums give you music,\n  And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,\n      My heart gives you love.\n\n\n\n\nOVER THE CARNAGE ROSE PROPHETIC A VOICE.\n\n\n  Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,\n  Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve the problems of freedom\n            yet,\n  Those who love each other shall become invincible,\n  They shall yet make Columbia victorious.\n\n  Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,\n  You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the\n            earth.\n\n  No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,\n  If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.\n  One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,\n  From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese, shall be\n            friends triune,\n  More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.\n\n  To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,\n  Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.\n\n  It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly\n            affection,\n  The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,\n  The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,\n  The continuance of equality shall be comrades.\n\n  These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,\n  I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.\n\n  (Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?\n  Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?\n  Nay, nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)\n\n\n\n\nI SAW OLD GENERAL AT BAY.\n\n\n  I saw old General at bay,\n  (Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)\n  His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works,\n  He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines, a desperate\n            emergency,\n  I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or three\n            were selected,\n  I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen'd with care, the\n            adjutant was very grave,\n  I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ARTILLERYMAN'S VISION.\n\n\n  While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,\n  And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight\n            passes,\n  And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the\n            breath of my infant,\n  There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;\n  The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,\n  The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the\n            irregular snap! snap!\n  I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short _t-h-t!\n            t-h-t!_ of the rifle-balls,\n  I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the\n            great shells shrieking as they pass,\n  The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees\n            (tumultuous now the contest rages,)\n  All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,\n  The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,\n  The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of\n            the right time,\n  After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the\n            effect;\n  Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel\n            leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)\n  I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no\n            delay,)\n  I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low\n            concealing all;\n  Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either\n            side,\n  Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and orders\n            of officers,\n  While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a\n            shout of applause, (some special success,)\n  And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in dreams\n            a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths\n            of my soul,)\n  And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,\n            cavalry, moving hither and thither,\n  (The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red I heed\n            not, some to the rear are hobbling,)\n  Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,\n  With the patter of small arms, the warning _s-s-t_ of the rifles,\n            (these in my vision I hear or see,)\n  And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets.\n\n\n\n\nETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLOURS.\n\n\n  Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,\n  With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet\n  Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colours greet?\n\n  ('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,\n  Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me,\n  As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)\n\n  _Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd,\n  A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,\n  Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought._\n\n  No further does she say, but lingering all the day,\n  Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,\n  And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.\n\n  What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?\n  Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?\n  Are the things so strange and marvellous you see or have seen?\n\n\n\n\nNOT YOUTH PERTAINS TO ME.\n\n\n  Not youth pertains to me,\n  Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,\n  Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,\n  In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still, for learning\n            inures not to me,\n  Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me-yet there are two or three things\n            inure to me,\n  I have nourish'd the wounded and sooth'd many a dying soldier,\n  And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,\n  Composed these songs.\n\n\n\n\nRACE OF VETERANS.\n\n\n  Race of veterans--race of victors!\n  Race of the soil, ready for conflict--race of the conquering march;\n  (No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race,)\n  Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,\n  Race of passion and the storm.\n\n\n\n\nWORLD TAKE GOOD NOTICE.\n\n\n  World take good notice, silver stars fading,\n  Milky hue ript, weft of white detaching,\n  Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,\n  Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,\n  Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.\n\n\n\n\nO TAN-FACED PRAIRIE-BOY.\n\n\n  O tan-faced prairie-boy,\n  Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,\n  Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among the\n            recruits,\n  You came, taciturn, with nothing to give-we but look'd on each other,\n  When lo; more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.\n\n\n\n\nLOOK DOWN FAIR MOON.\n\n\n  Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,\n  Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,\n            purple,\n  On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,\n  Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.\n\n\n\n\nRECONCILIATION.\n\n\n  Word over all, beautiful as the sky,\n  Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be\n            utterly lost,\n  That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash\n            again, and ever again, this soil'd world;\n  For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,\n  I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin-I draw near,\n  Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the\n            coffin.\n\n\n\n\nHOW SOLEMN AS ONE BY ONE.\n\n(_Washington City, 1865._)\n\n\n  How solemn as one by one,\n  As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where I\n            stand,\n  As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the\n            masks,\n  (As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,\n            whoever you are,)\n  How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,\n            and to you,\n  I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,\n  O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,\n  Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;\n  The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,\n  Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,\n  Nor the bayonet stab O friend.\n\n\n\n\nAS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO.\n\n\n  As I lay with my head in your lap camerado,\n  The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open air I\n            resume,\n  I know I am restless and make others so,\n  I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,\n  For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle\n            them,\n  I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have\n            been had all accepted me,\n  I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,\n            majorities, nor ridicule,\n  And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me;\n  And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;\n  Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still\n            urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,\n  Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.\n\n\n\n\nDELICATE CLUSTER.\n\n\n  Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!\n  Covering all my lands-all my seashores lining!\n  Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle\n            pressing!\n  How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)\n  Flag cerulean-sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!\n  Ah my silvery beauty-ah my woolly white and crimson!\n  Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!\n  My sacred one, my mother.\n\n\n\n\nTO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN.\n\n\n  Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?\n  Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?\n  Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?\n  Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor\n            am I now;\n  (I have been born of the same as the war was born,\n  The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the\n            martial dirge,\n  With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral;)\n  What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my\n            works,\n  And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with\n            piano-tunes,\n  For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.\n\n\n\n\nLO, VICTRESS ON THE PEAKS.\n\n\n  Lo, Victress on the peaks,\n  Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,\n  (The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)\n  Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,\n  Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,\n  Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom--lo, in these\n            hours supreme,\n  No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous\n            verse,\n  But a cluster containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,\n  And psalms of the dead.\n\n\n\n\nSPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE.\n\n(_Washington City, 1865._)\n\n\n  Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!\n  Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;\n  Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering\n            pressing),\n  Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,\n  That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tireless\n            phantom flitted,\n  Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the\n            drum,\n  Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,\n            reverberates round me,\n  As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,\n  As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,\n  As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,\n  As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the\n            distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,\n  Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,\n  Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;\n  Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death\n            next day,\n  Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,\n  Leave me your pulses of rage-bequeath them to me-fill me with\n            currents convulsive,\n  Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,\n  Let them identify you to the future in these songs.\n\n\n\n\nADIEU TO A SOLDIER.\n\n\n  Adieu O soldier,\n  You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)\n  The rapid march, the life of the camp,\n  The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,\n  Bed battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong, terrific\n            game,\n  Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you\n            and like of you all fill'd,\n  With war and war's expression.\n\n  Adieu dear comrade,\n  Your mission is fulfill'd--but I, more warlike,\n  Myself and this contentious soul of mine,\n  Still on our own campaigning bound,\n  Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,\n  Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,\n  Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out--aye here,\n  To fiercer, weightier battles give expression.\n\n\n\n\nTURN O LIBERTAD.\n\n\n  Turn O Libertad, for the war is over,\n  From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,\n            sweeping the world,\n  Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,\n  From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,\n  From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery,\n            caste,\n  Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that\n            backward world,\n  Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,\n  But what remains remains for singers for you--wars to come are for\n            you,\n  (Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the wars\n            of the present also inure;)\n  Then turn, and be not alarm'd O Libertad--turn your undying face,\n  To where the future, greater than all the past,\n  Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE LEAVEN'D SOIL THEY TROD.\n\n\n  To the leaven'd soil they trod calling I sing for the last,\n  (Forth from my tent emerging for good, loosing, untying the\n            tent-ropes,)\n  In the freshness the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits and\n            vistas again to peace restored,\n  To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond, to the\n            South and the North,\n  To the leaven'd soil of the general Western world to attest my songs,\n  To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi,\n  To the rocks I calling sing, and all the trees in the woods,\n  To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading wide,\n  To the far-off sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air;\n  And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)\n  The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely,\n  The prairie draws me close, as the father to bosom broad the son,\n  The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end,\n  But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"8801"},{"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE PROSE WORKS\n\nSpecimen Days and Collect, November Boughs and Good Bye My Fancy\n\nBy Walt

Incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is that huddle of\ndiary-jottings, war-memoranda of 1862-'65, Nature-notes of 1877-'81,\nwith Western and Canadian observations afterwards, all bundled up and\ntied by a big string, the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this\nday, this hour,--(and what a day! What an hour just passing! the luxury\nof riant grass and blowing breeze, with all the shows of sun and sky and\nperfect temperature, never before so filling me, body and soul),--to\ngo home, untie the bundle, reel out diary-scraps and memoranda, just as\nthey are, large or small, one after another, into print-pages,[1]\nand let the melange's lackings and wants of connection take care of\nthemselves. It will illustrate one phase of humanity anyhow; how few of\nlife's days and hours (and they not by relative value or proportion, but\nby chance) are ever noted. Probably another point, too, how we give long\npreparations for some object, planning and delving and fashioning, and\nthen, when the actual hour for doing arrives, find ourselves still quite\nunprepared, and tumble the thing together, letting hurry and crudeness\ntell the story better than fine work. At any rate I obey my happy\nhour's command, which seems curiously imperative. May be, if I don't\ndo anything else, I shall send out the most wayward, spontaneous,\nfragmentary book ever printed.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[1] The pages from 1 to 15 are nearly verbatim an off-hand letter of\nmine in January, 1882, to an insisting friend. Following, I give some\ngloomy experiences. The war of attempted secession has, of course, been\nthe distinguishing event of my time. I commenced at the close of 1862,\nand continued steadily through '63, '64 and '65, to visit the sick\nand wounded of the army, both on the field and in the hospitals in and\naround Washington city. From the first I kept little note-books\nfor impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory of names and\ncircumstances, and what was specially wanted, &c. In these, I brief'd\ncases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the bed-side, and\nnot seldom by the corpses of the dead. Some were scratch'd down from\nnarratives I heard and itemized while watching, or waiting, or tending\nsomebody amid those scenes. I have dozens of such little note-books\nleft, forming a special history of those years, for myself alone, full\nof associations never to be possibly said or sung. I wish I could convey\nto the reader the associations that attach to these soil'd and creas'd\nlivraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to\ncarry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin. I leave them just as I\nthrew them by after the war, blotch'd here and there with more than one\nblood-stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom\namid the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting\nready for it, or a march. Most of the pages from 20 to 75 are verbatim\ncopies of those lurid and blood-smuch'd little notebooks.\n\nVery different are most of the memoranda that follow. Some time after\nthe war ended I had a paralytic stroke, which prostrated me for several\nyears. In 1876 I began to get over the worst of it. From this date,\nportions of several seasons, especially summers, I spent at a secluded\nhaunt down in Camden county, New Jersey--Timber creek, quite a little\nriver (it enters from the great Delaware, twelve miles away)--with\nprimitive solitudes, winding stream, recluse and woody banks,\nsweet-feeding springs, and all the charms that birds, grass,\nwild-flowers, rabbits and squirrels, old oaks, walnut trees, &c., can\nbring. Through these times, and on these spots, the diary from page 76\nonward was mostly written.\n\nThe COLLECT afterwards gathers up the odds and ends of whatever pieces\nI can now lay hands on, written at various times past, and swoops all\ntogether like fish in a net.\n\nI suppose I publish and leave the whole gathering, first, from that\neternal tendency to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all Nature,\nauthors included; second, to symbolize two or three specimen interiors,\npersonal and other, out of the myriads of my time, the middle range of\nthe Nineteenth century in the New World; a strange, unloosen'd, wondrous\ntime. But the book is probably without any definite purpose that can be\ntold in a statement.\n\n\nANSWER TO AN INSISTING FRIEND\n\nYou ask for items, details of my early life--of genealogy and\nparentage, particularly of the women of my ancestry, and of its far-back\nNetherlands stock on the maternal side--of the region where I was\nborn and raised, and my mother and father before me, and theirs before\nthem--with a word about Brooklyn and New York cities, the times I lived\nthere as lad and young man. You say you want to get at these details\nmainly as the go-befores and embryons of \"Leaves of Grass.\" Very good;\nyou shall have at least some specimens of them all. I have often thought\nof the meaning of such things--that one can only encompass and complete\nmatters of that kind by 'exploring behind, perhaps very far behind,\nthemselves directly, and so into their genesis, antecedents, and\ncumulative stages. Then as luck would have it, I lately whiled away the\ntedium of a week's half-sickness and confinement, by collating these\nvery items for another (yet unfulfilled, probably abandon'd,) purpose;\nand if you will be satisfied with them, authentic in date-occurrence and\nfact simply, and told my own way, garrulous-like, here they are. I shall\nnot hesitate to make extracts, for I catch at anything to save labor;\nbut those will be the best versions of what I want to convey.\n\n\nGENEALOGY--VAN VELSOR AND WHITMAN\n\nThe later years of the last century found the Van Velsor family, my\nmother's side, living on their own farm at Cold Spring, Long Island, New\nYork State, near the eastern edge of Queen's county, about a mile from\nthe harbor.[2] My father's side--probably the fifth generation from the\nfirst English arrivals in New England--were at the same time farmers\non their own land--(and a fine domain it was, 500 acres, all good soil,\ngently sloping east and south, about one-tenth woods, plenty of grand\nold trees,) two or three miles off, at West Hills, Suffolk county. The\nWhitman name in the Eastern States, and so branch and South, starts\nundoubtedly from one John Whitman, born 1602, in Old England, where he\ngrew up, married, and his eldest son was born in 1629. He came over in\nthe \"True Love\" in 1640 to America, and lived in Weymouth, Mass., which\nplace became the mother-hive of the New-Englanders of the name; he died\nin 1692. His brother, Rev. Zechariah Whitman, also came over in the\n\"True Love,\" either at that time or soon after, and lived at Milford,\nConn. A son of this Zechariah, named Joseph, migrated to Huntington,\nLong Island, and permanently settled there. Savage's \"Genealogical\nDictionary\" (vol. iv, p. 524) gets the Whitman family establish'd at\nHuntington, per this Joseph, before 1664. It is quite certain that from\nthat beginning, and from Joseph, the West Hill Whitmans, and all others\nin Suffolk county, have since radiated, myself among the number. John\nand Zechariah both went to England and back again divers times; they\nhad large families, and several of their children were born in the old\ncountry. We hear of the father of John and Zechariah, Abijah Whitman,\nwho goes over into the 1500's, but we know little about him, except that\nhe also was for some time in America.\n\nThese old pedigree-reminiscences come up to me vividly from a visit I\nmade not long since (in my 63d year) to West Hills, and to the burial\ngrounds of my ancestry, both sides. I extract from notes of that visit,\nwritten there and then:\n\n\nNote:\n\n[2] Long Island was settled first on the west end by the Dutch from\nHolland, then on the east end by the English--the dividing line of the\ntwo nationalities being a little west of Huntington where my father's\nfolks lived, and where I was born.\n\n\nTHE OLD WHITMAN AND VAN VELSOR CEMETERIES\n\n_July 29, 1881_.--After more than forty years' absence, (except a brief\nvisit, to take my father there once more, two years before he died,)\nwent down Long Island on a week' s jaunt to the place where I was born,\nthirty miles from New York city. Rode around the old familiar spots,\nviewing and pondering and dwelling long upon them, every-thing coming\nback to me. Went to the old Whitman homestead on the upland and took a\nview eastward, inclining south, over the broad and beautiful farm lands\nof my grandfather (1780,) and my father. There was the new house (1810,)\nthe big oak a hundred and fifty or two hundred years old; there\nthe well, the sloping kitchen-garden, and a little way off even the\nwell-kept remains of the dwelling of my great-grandfather (1750-'60)\nstill standing, with its mighty timbers and low ceilings. Near by, a\nstately grove of tall, vigorous black-walnuts, beautiful, Apollo-like,\nthe sons or grandsons, no doubt, of black-walnuts during or before 1776.\nOn the other side of the road spread the famous apple orchard, over\ntwenty acres, the trees planted by hands long mouldering in the grave\n(my uncle Jesse's,) but quite many of them evidently capable of throwing\nout their annual blossoms and fruit yet.\n\nI now write these lines seated on an old grave (doubtless of a century\nsince at least) on the burial hill of the Whitmans of many generations.\nFifty or more graves are quite plainly traceable, and as many more\ndecay'd out of all form--depress'd mounds, crumbled and broken stones,\ncover'd with moss--the gray and sterile hill, the clumps of chestnuts\noutside, the silence, just varied by the soughing wind. There is\nalways the deepest eloquence of sermon or poem in any of these ancient\ngraveyards of which Long Island has so many; so what must this one have\nbeen to me? My whole family history, with its succession of links,\nfrom the first settlement down to date, told here--three centuries\nconcentrate on this sterile acre.\n\nThe next day, July 30, I devoted to the maternal locality, and if\npossible was still more penetrated and impress'd. I write this paragraph\non the burial hul of the Van Velsors, near Cold Spring, the most\nsignificant depository of the dead that could be imagin'd, without the\nslightest help from art, but far ahead of it, soil sterile, a mostly\nbare plateau-flat of half an acre, the top of a hill, brush and well\ngrown trees and dense woods bordering all around, very primi-tive,\nsecluded, no visitors, no road (you cannot drive here, you have to bring\nthe dead on foot, and follow on foot.) Two or three-score graves quite\nplain; as many more almost rubb'd out. My grandfather Cornelius and my\ngrandmother Amy (Naomi) and numerous relatives nearer or remoter, on\nmy mother's side, lie buried here. The scene as I stood or sat, the\ndelicate and wild odor of the woods, a slightly drizzling rain, the\nemotional atmosphere of the place, and the inferr'd reminiscences, were\nfitting accompaniments.\n\n\nTHE MATERNAL HOMESTEAD\n\nI went down from this ancient grave place eighty or ninety rods to the\nsite of the Van Velsor homestead, where my mother was born (1795,)\nand where every spot had been familiar to me as a child and youth\n(1825-'40.) Then stood there a long rambling, dark-gray, shingle-sided\nhouse, with sheds, pens, a great barn, and much open road-space. Now of\nall those not a vestige left; all had been pull'd down, erased, and the\nplough and harrow pass'd over foundations, road-spaces and everything,\nfor many summers; fenced in at present, and grain and clover growing\nlike any other fine fields. Only a big hole from the cellar, with some\nlittle heaps of broken stone, green with grass and weeds, identified\nthe place. Even the copious old brook and spring seem'd to have mostly\ndwindled away. The whole scene, with what it arous'd, memories of\nmy young days there half a century ago, the vast kitchen and ample\nfireplace and the sitting-room adjoining, the plain furniture, the\nmeals, the house full of merry people, my grandmother Amy's sweet old\nface in its Quaker cap, my grandfather \"the Major,\" jovial, red, stout,\nwith sonorous voice and characteristic physiognomy, with the actual\nsights themselves, made the most pronounc'd half-day's experience of my\nwhole jaunt.\n\nFor there with all those wooded, hilly, healthy surroundings, my dearest\nmother, Louisa Van Velsor, grew up--(her mother, Amy Williams, of the\nFriends' or Quakers' denomination--the Williams family, seven sisters\nand one brother--the father and brother sailors, both of whom met their\ndeaths at sea.) The Van Velsor people were noted for fine horses, which\nthe men bred and train'd from blooded stock. My mother, as a young\nwoman, was a daily and daring rider. As to the head of the family\nhimself, the old race of the Netherlands, so deeply grafted on Manhattan\nisland and in Kings and Queens counties, never yielded a more mark'd and\nfull Americanized specimen than Major Cornelius Van Velsor.\n\n\nTWO OLD FAMILY INTERIORS\n\nOf the domestic and inside life of the middle of Long Island, at and\njust before that time, here are two samples:\n\n\"The Whitmans, at the beginning of the present century, lived in a long\nstory-and-a-half farm-house, hugely timber'd, which is still standing.\nA great smoke-canopied kitchen, with vast hearth and chimney, form'd one\nend of the house. The existence of slavery in New York at that time, and\nthe possession by the family of some twelve or fifteen slaves, house and\nfield servants, gave things quite a patriarchial look. The very young\ndarkies could be seen, a swarm of them, toward sundown, in this kitchen,\nsquatted in a circle on the floor, eating their supper of Indian pudding\nand milk. In the house, and in food and furniture, all was rude, but\nsubstantial. No carpets or stoves were known, and no coffee, and tea or\nsugar only for the women. Rousing wood fires gave both warmth and light\non winter nights. Pork, poultry, beef, and all the ordinary vegetables\nand grains were plentiful. Cider was the men's common drink, and used at\nmeals. The clothes were mainly homespun. Journeys were made by both men\nand women on horseback. Both sexes labor'd with their own hands-the men\non the farm--the women in the house and around it. Books were scarce.\nThe annual copy of the almanac was a treat, and was pored over through\nthe long winter evenings. I must not forget to mention that both these\nfamilies were near enough to the sea to behold it from the high places,\nand to hear in still hours the roar of the surf; the latter, after\na storm, giving a peculiar sound at night. Then all hands, male and\nfemale, went down frequently on beach and bathing parties, and the men\non practical expeditions for cutting salt hay, and for clamming and\nfishing.\"--_John Burroughs's_ NOTES.\n\n\"The ancestors of Walt Whitman, on both the paternal and maternal\nsides, kept a good table, sustained the hospitalities, decorums, and an\nexcellent social reputation in the county, and they were often of mark'd\nindividuality. If space permitted, I should consider some of the men\nworthy special description; and still more some of the women. His\ngreat-grandmother on the paternal side, for instance, was a large\nswarthy woman, who lived to a very old age. She smoked tobacco, rode on\nhorseback like a man, managed the most vicious horse, and, becoming\na widow in later life, went forth every day over her farm-lands,\nfrequently in the saddle, directing the labor of her slaves, in\nlanguage in which, on exciting occasions, oaths were not spared. The\ntwo immediate grandmothers were, in the best sense, superior women. The\nmaternal one (Amy Williams before marriage) was a Friend, or Quakeress,\nof sweet, sensible character, house-wifely proclivities, and deeply\nintuitive and spiritual. The other (Hannah Brush,) was an equally noble,\nperhaps stronger character, lived to be very old, had quite a family of\nsons, was a natural lady, was in early life a school-mistress, and had\ngreat solidity of mind. W. W. himself makes much of the women of his\nancestry.\"--_The Same_.\n\nOut from these arrieres of persons and scenes, I was born May 31,\n1819. And now to dwell awhile on the locality itself--as the successive\ngrowth-stages of my infancy, childhood, youth and manhood were all\npass'd on Long Island, which I sometimes feel as if I had incorporated.\nI roam'd, as boy and man, and have lived in nearly all parts, from\nBrooklyn to Montauk point.\n\n\nPAUMANOK, AND MY LIFE ON IT AS CHILD AND YOUNG MAN\n\nWorth fully and particularly investigating indeed this Paumanok, (to\ngive the spot its aboriginal name[3],) stretching east through Kings,\nQueens and Suffolk counties, 120 miles altogether--on the north Long\nIsland sound, a beautiful, varied and picturesque series of inlets,\n\"necks\" and sea-like expansions, for a hundred miles to Orient point.\nOn the ocean side the great south bay dotted with countless hummocks,\nmostly small, some quite large, occasionally long bars of sand out two\nhundred rods to a mile-and-a-half from the shore. While now and then,\nas at Rockaway and far east along the Hamptons, the beach makes right\non the island, the sea dashing up without intervention. Several\nlight-houses on the shores east; a long history of wrecks tragedies,\nsome even of late years. As a youngster, I was in the atmosphere and\ntraditions of many of these wrecks--of one or two almost an observer.\nOff Hempstead beach for example, was the loss of the ship \"Mexico\" in\n1840, (alluded to in \"the Sleepers\" in L. of G.) And at Hampton, some\nyears later, the destruction of the brig \"Elizabeth,\" a fearful affair,\nin one of the worst winter gales, where Margaret Fuller went down, with\nher husband and child.\n\nInside the outer bars or beach this south bay is everywhere\ncomparatively shallow; of cold winters all thick ice on the surface.\nAs a boy I often went forth with a chum or two, on those frozen fields,\nwith hand-sled, axe and eel-spear, after messes of eels. We would cut\nholes in the ice, sometimes striking quite an eel-bonanza, and filling\nour baskets with great, fat, sweet, white-meated fellows. The scenes,\nthe ice, drawing the hand-sled, cutting holes, spearing the eels, &c.,\nwere of course just such fun as is dearest to boyhood. The shores of\nthis bay, winter and summer, and my doings there in early life, are\nwoven all through L. of G. One sport I was very fond of was to go on\na bay-party in summer to gather sea-gull's eggs. (The gulls lay two or\nthree eggs, more than half the size of hen's eggs, right on the sand,\nand leave the sun's heat to hatch them.)\n\nThe eastern end of Long Island, the Peconic bay region, I knew quite\nwell too--sail'd more than once around Shelter island, and down to\nMontauk--spent many an hour on Turtle hill by the old light-house, on\nthe extreme point, looking out over the ceaseless roll of the Atlantic.\nI used to like to go down there and fraternize with the blue-fishers,\nor the annual squads of sea-bass takers. Sometimes, along Montauk\npeninsula, (it is some 15 miles long, and good grazing,) met the\nstrange, unkempt, half-barbarous herdsmen, at that time living there\nentirely aloof from society or civilization, in charge, on those rich\npasturages, of vast droves of horses, kine or sheep, own'd by farmers\nof the eastern towns. Sometimes, too, the few remaining Indians, or\nhalf-breeds, at that period left on Montauk peninsula, but now I believe\naltogether extinct.\n\nMore in the middle of the island were the spreading Hempstead plains,\nthen (1830-'40) quite prairie-like, open, uninhabited, rather sterile,\ncover'd with kill-calf and huckleberry bushes, yet plenty of fair\npasture for the cattle, mostly milch-cows, who fed there by hundreds,\neven thousands, and at evening, (the plains too were own'd by the towns,\nand this was the use of them in common,) might be seen taking their way\nhome, branching off regularly in the right places. I have often been out\non the edges of these plains toward sundown, and can yet recall in\nfancy the interminable cow-processions, and hear the music of the tin or\ncopper bells clanking far or near, and breathe the cool of the sweet and\nslightly aromatic evening air, and note the sunset.\n\nThrough the same region of the island, but further east, extended wide\ncentral tracts of pine and scrub-oak, (charcoal was largely made here,)\nmonotonous and sterile. But many a good day or half-day did I have,\nwandering through those solitary crossroads, inhaling the peculiar\nand wild aroma. Here, and all along the island and its shores, I spent\nintervals many years, all seasons, sometimes riding, sometimes boating,\nbut generally afoot, (I was always then a good walker,) absorbing\nfields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers,\npilots-always had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter, and with\nfishermen--went every summer on sailing trips--always liked the bare\nsea-beach, south side, and have some of my happiest hours on it to this\nday.\n\nAs I write, the whole experience comes back to me after the lapse of\nforty and more years--the soothing rustle of the waves, and the saline\nsmell--boyhood's times, the clam-digging, bare-foot, and with trowsers\nroll'd up--hauling down the creek--the perfume of the sedge-meadows--the\nhay-boat, and the chowder and fishing excursions;--or, of later years,\nlittle voyages down and out New York bay, in the pilot boats. Those same\nlater years, also, while living in Brooklyn, (1836-'50) I went regularly\nevery week in the mild seasons down to Coney Island, at that time a\nlong, bare unfrequented shore, which I had all to myself, and where I\nloved, after bathing, to race up and down the hard sand, and declaim\nHomer or Shakspere to the surf and sea gulls by the hour. But I am\ngetting ahead too rapidly, and must keep more in my traces.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n[3] \"Paumanok, (or Paumanake, or Paumanack, the Indian name of Long\nIsland,) over a hundred miles long; shaped like a fish--plenty of sea\nshore, sandy, stormy, uninviting, the horizon boundless, the air too\nstrong for invalids, the bays a wonderful resort for aquatic birds,\nthe south-side meadows cover'd with salt hay, the soil of the island\ngenerally tough, but good for the locust-tree, the apple orchard, and\nthe blackberry, and with numberless springs of the sweetest water in the\nworld. Years ago, among the bay-men--a strong, wild race, now extinct,\nor rather entirely changed--a native of Long Island was called a\n_Paumanacker_, or _Creole-'Paumanacker_.\"--_John Burroughs_.\n\n\nMY FIRST READING--LAFAYETTE\n\nFrom 1824 to '28 our family lived in Brooklyn in Front, Cranberry and\nJohnson streets. In the latter my father built a nice house for a home,\nand afterwards another in Tillary street. We occupied them, one after\nthe other, but they were mortgaged, and we lost them. I yet remember\nLafayette's visit.[4] Most of these years I went to the public schools.\nIt must have been about 1829 or '30 that I went with my father and\nmother to hear Elias Hicks preach in a ball-room on Brooklyn heights. At\nabout the same time employ'd as a boy in an office, lawyers', father and\ntwo sons, Clarke's, Fulton street, near Orange. I had a nice desk and\nwindow-nook to myself; Edward C. kindly help'd me at my handwriting\nand composition, and, (the signal event of my life up to that time,)\nsubscribed for me to a big circulating library. For a time I now revel'd\nin romance-reading of all kinds; first, the \"Arabian Nights,\" all\nthe volumes, an amazing treat. Then, with sorties in very many other\ndirections, took in Walter Scott's novels, one after another, and his\npoetry, (and continue to enjoy novels and poetry to this day.)\n\n\nNote:\n\n[4] \"On the visit of General Lafayette to this country, in 1824, he came\nover to Brooklyn in state, and rode through the city. The children of\nthe schools turn'd out to join in the welcome. An edifice for a free\npublic library for youths was just then commencing, and Lafayette\nconsented to stop on his way and lay the corner-stone. Numerous children\narriving on the ground, where a huge irregular excavation for the\nbuilding was already dug, surrounded with heaps of rough stone, several\ngentlemen assisted in lifting the children to safe or convenient\nspots to see the ceremony. Among the rest, Lafayette, also helping the\nchildren, took up the five-year-old Walt Whitman, and pressing the child\na moment to his breast, and giving him a kiss, handed him down to a safe\nspot in the excavation.\"--John Burroughs.\n\n\nPRINTING OFFICE--OLD BROOKLYN\n\nAfter about two years went to work in a weekly newspaper and printing\noffice, to learn the trade. The paper was the \"Long Island Patriot,\"\nowned by S. E. Clements, who was also postmaster. An old printer in\nthe office, William Hartshorne, a revolutionary character, who had seen\nWashington, was a special friend of mine, and I had many a talk with him\nabout long past times. The apprentices, including myself, boarded with\nhis grand-daughter. I used occasionally to go out riding with the boss,\nwho was very kind to us boys; Sundays he took us all to a great old\nrough, fortress-looking stone church, on Joralemon street, near where\nthe Brooklyn city hall now is--(at that time broad fields and country\nroads everywhere around.[5]) Afterward I work'd on the \"Long Island\nStar,\" Alden Spooner's paper. My father all these years pursuing his\ntrade as carpenter and builder, with varying fortune. There was a\ngrowing family of children--eight of us--my brother Jesse the oldest,\nmyself the second, my dear sisters Mary and Hannah Louisa, my brothers\nAndrew, George, Thomas Jefferson, and then my youngest brother, Edward,\nborn 1835, and always badly crippled, as I am myself of late years.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[5] Of the Brooklyn of that time (1830-40) hardly anything remains,\nexcept the lines of the old streets. The population was then between ten\nand twelve thousand. For a mile Fulton street was lined with magnificent\nelm trees. The character of the place was thoroughly rural. As a sample\nof comparative values, it may be mention'd that twenty-five acres in\nwhat is now the most costly part of the city, bounded by Flatbush and\nFulton avenues, were then bought by Mr Parmentier, a French _emigre_,\nfor $4000. Who remembers the old places as they were? Who remembers the\nold citizens of that time? Among the former were Smith & Wood's, Coe\nDowning's, and other public houses at the ferry, the old Ferry itself,\nLove lane, the Heights as then, the Wallabout with the wooden bridge,\nand the road out beyond Fulton street to the old toll-gate. Among the\nlatter were the majestic and genial General Jeremiah Johnson, with\nothers, Gabriel Furman, Rev. E. M. Johnson, Alden Spooner, Mr.\nPierrepont, Mr. Joralemon, Samuel Willoughby, Jonathan Trotter, George\nHall, Cyrus P. Smith, N. B. Morse, John Dikeman, Adrian Hegeman, William\nUdall, and old Mr. Duflon, with his military garden.\n\n\nGROWTH--HEALTH--WORK\n\nI develop'd (1833-4-5) into a healthy, strong youth (grew too fast,\nthough, was nearly as big as a man at 15 or 16.) Our family at this\nperiod moved back to the country, my dear mother very ill for a long\ntime, but recover'd. All these years I was down Long Island more or less\nevery summer, now east, now west, sometimes months at a stretch. At\n16, 17, and so on, was fond of debating societies, and had an active\nmembership with them, off and on, in Brooklyn and one or two country\ntowns on the island. A most omnivorous novel-reader, these and later\nyears, devour'd everything I could get. Fond of the theatre, also, in\nNew York, went whenever I could--sometimes witnessing fine performances.\n\n1836-7, work'd as compositor in printing offices in New York city. Then,\nwhen little more than 18, and for a while afterwards, went to teaching\ncountry schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties, Long Island, and\n\"boarded round.\" (This latter I consider one of my best experiences and\ndeepest lessons in human nature behind the scenes and in the masses.)\nIn '39, '40, I started and publish'd a weekly paper in my native town,\nHuntington. Then returning to New York city and Brooklyn, work'd on as\nprinter and writer, mostly prose, but an occasional shy at \"poetry\".\n\n\nMY PASSION FOR FERRIES\n\nLiving in Brooklyn or New York city from this time forward, my life,\nthen, and still more the following years, was curiously identified with\nFulton ferry, already becoming the greatest of its sort in the world\nfor general importance, volume, variety, rapidity, and picturesqueness.\nAlmost daily, later, ('50 to '60,) I cross'd on the boats, often up\nin the pilot-houses where I could get a full sweep, absorbing\nshows, accompaniments, surroundings. What oceanic currents, eddies,\nunderneath--the great tides of humanity also, with ever-shifting\nmovements. Indeed, I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they\nafford inimitable, streaming, never-failing, living poems. The river\nand bay scenery, all about New York island, any time of a fine day--the\nhurrying, splashing sea-tides--the changing panorama of steamers, all\nsizes, often a string of big ones outward bound to distant ports--the\nmyriads of white-sail'd schooners, sloops, skiffs, and the marvellously\nbeautiful yachts--the majestic sound boats as they rounded the Battery\nand came along towards 5, afternoon, eastward bound--the prospect off\ntowards Staten Island, or down the Narrows, or the other way up the\nHudson--what refreshment of spirit such sights and experiences gave me\nyears ago (and many a time since.) My old pilot friends, the Balsirs,\nJohnny Cole, Ira Smith, William White, and my young ferry friend, Tom\nGere--how well I remember them all.\n\n\nBROADWAY SIGHTS\n\nBesides Fulton ferry, off and on for years, I knew and frequented\nBroadway--that noted avenue of New York's crowded and mixed humanity,\nand of so many notables. Here I saw, during those times, Andrew Jackson,\nWebster, Clay, Seward, Martin Van Buren, filibuster Walker, Kossuth,\nFitz Greene Halleck, Bryant, the Prince of Wales, Charles Dickens, the\nfirst Japanese ambassadors, and lots of other celebrities of the time.\nAlways something novel or inspiriting; yet mostly to me the hurrying and\nvast amplitude of those never-ending human currents. I remember seeing\nJames Fenimore Cooper in a court-room in Chambers street, back of the\ncity hall, where he was carrying on a law case--(I think it was a charge\nof libel he had brought against some one.) I also remember seeing Edgar\nA. Poe, and having a short interview with him, (it must have been in\n1845 or '6,) in his office, second story of a corner building, (Duane\nor Pearl street.) He was editor and owner or part owner of \"the Broadway\nJournal.\" The visit was about a piece of mine he had publish'd. Poe was\nvery cordial, in a quiet way, appear'd well in person, dress, &c. I\nhave a distinct and pleasing remembrance of his looks, voice, manner and\nmatter; very kindly and human, but subdued, perhaps a little jaded. For\nanother of my reminiscences, here on the west side, just below Houston\nstreet, I once saw (it must have been about 1832, of a sharp, bright\nJanuary day) a bent, feeble but stout-built very old man, bearded,\nswathed in rich furs, with a great ermine cap on his head, led and\nassisted, almost carried, down the steps of his high front stoop (a\ndozen friends and servants, emulous, carefully holding, guiding him) and\nthen lifted and tuck'd in a gorgeous sleigh, envelop'd in other furs,\nfor a ride. The sleigh was drawn by as fine a team of horses as I ever\nsaw. (You needn't think all the best animals are brought up nowadays;\nnever was such horseflesh as fifty years ago on Long Island, or south,\nor in New York city; folks look'd for spirit and mettle in a nag, not\ntame speed merely.) Well, I, a boy of perhaps 13 or 14, stopp'd and\ngazed long at the spectacle of that fur-swathed old man, surrounded by\nfriends and servants, and the careful seating of him in the sleigh. I\nremember the spirited, champing horses, the driver with his whip, and a\nfellow-driver by his side, for extra prudence. The old man, the subject\nof so much attention, I can almost see now. It was John Jacob Astor.\n\nThe years 1846, '47, and there along, see me still in New York City,\nworking as writer and printer, having my usual good health, and a good\ntime generally.\n\n\nOMNIBUS JAUNTS AND DRIVERS\n\nOne phase of those days must by no means go unrecorded--namely, the\nBroadway omnibuses, with their drivers.\n\nThe vehicles still (I write this paragraph in 1881) give a portion\nof the character of Broadway--the Fifth avenue, Madison avenue, and\nTwenty-third street lines yet running. But the flush days of the old\nBroadway stages, characteristic and copious, are over. The Yellow-birds,\nthe Red-birds, the original Broadway, the Fourth avenue, the\nKnickerbocker, and a dozen others of twenty or thirty years ago, are all\ngone. And the men specially identified with them, and giving vitality\nand meaning to them--the drivers--a strange, natural, quick-eyed and\nwondrous race--(not only Rabelais and Cervantes would have gloated upon\nthem, but Homer and Shakspere would)--how well I remember them, and\nmust here give a word about them. How many hours, forenoons and\nafternoons--how many exhilarating night-times I have had--perhaps June\nor July, in cooler air-riding the whole length of Broadway, listening\nto some yarn, (and the most vivid yarns ever spun, and the rarest\nmimicry)--or perhaps I declaiming some stormy passage from Julius Caesar\nor Richard, (you could roar as loudly as you chose in that heavy, dense,\nuninterrupted street-bass.) Yes, I knew all the drivers then, Broadway\nJack, Dressmaker, Balky Bill, George Storms, Old Elephant, his brother\nYoung Elephant (who came afterward,) Tippy, Pop Rice, Big Frank,\nYellow Joe, Pete Callahan, Patsey Dee, and dozens more; for there were\nhundreds. They had immense qualities, largely animal--eating, drinking;\nwomen--great personal pride, in their way--perhaps a few slouches here\nand there, but I should have trusted the general run of them, in their\nsimple good-will and honor, under all circumstances. Not only for\ncomradeship, and sometimes affection--great studies I found them also.\n(I suppose the critics will laugh heartily, but the influence of those\nBroadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades\nundoubtedly enter'd into the gestation of \"Leaves of Grass.\")\n\n\nPLAYS AND OPERAS TOO\n\nAnd certain actors and singers, had a good deal to do with the business.\nAll through these years, off and on, I frequented the old Park, the\nBowery, Broadway and Chatham-square theatres, and the Italian operas\nat Chambers-street, Astor-place or the Battery--many seasons was on\nthe free list, writing for papers even as quite a youth. The old Park\ntheatre--what names, reminiscences, the words bring back! Placide,\nClarke, Mrs. Vernon, Fisher, Clara F., Mrs. Wood, Mrs. Seguin,\nEllen Tree, Hackett, the younger Kean, Macready, Mrs. Richardson,\nRice--singers, tragedians, comedians. What perfect acting! Henry Placide\nin \"Napoleon's Old Guard\" or \"Grandfather Whitehead,\"--or \"the Provoked\nHusband\" of Gibber, with Fanny Kemble as Lady Townley--or Sheridan\nKnowles in his own \"Virginius\"--or inimitable Power in \"Born to Good\nLuck.\" These, and many more, the years of youth and onward. Fanny\nKemble--name to conjure up great mimic scenes withal--perhaps the\ngreatest. I remember well her rendering of Bianca in \"Fazio,\" and\nMarianna in \"the Wife.\" Nothing finer did ever stage exhibit--the\nveterans of all nations said so, and my boyish heart and head felt it in\nevery minute cell. The lady was just matured, strong, better than merely\nbeautiful, born from the footlights, had had three years' practice in\nLondon and through the British towns, and then she came to give America\nthat young maturity and roseate power in all their noon, or rather\nforenoon, flush. It was my good luck to see her nearly every night she\nplay'd at the old Park--certainly in all her principal characters. I\nheard, these years, well render'd, all the Italian and other operas\nin vogue, \"Sonnambula,\" \"the Puritans,\" \"Der Freischutz,\" \"Huguenots,\"\n\"Fille d'Regiment,\" \"Faust,\" \"Etoile du Nord,\" \"Poliuto,\" and others.\nVerdi's \"Ernani,\" \"Rigoletto,\" and \"Trovatore,\" with Donnizetti's\n\"Lucia\" or \"Favorita\" or \"Lucrezia,\" and Auber's \"Massaniello,\" or\nRossini's \"William Tell\" and \"Gazza Ladra,\" were among my special\nenjoyments. I heard Alboni every time she sang in New York and\nvicinity--also Grisi, the tenor Mario, and the baritone Badiali, the\nfinest in the world.\n\nThis musical passion follow'd my theatrical one. As a boy or young man\nI had seen, (reading them carefully the day beforehand,) quite all\nShakspere's acting dramas, play'd wonderfully well. Even yet I cannot\nconceive anything finer than old Booth in \"Richard Third,\" or \"Lear,\"\n(I don't know which was best,) or Iago, (or Pescara, or Sir Giles\nOverreach, to go outside of Shakspere)--or Tom Hamblin in \"Macbeth\"--or\nold Clarke, either as the ghost in \"Hamlet,\" or as Prospero in \"the\nTempest,\" with Mrs. Austin as Ariel, and Peter Richings as Caliban. Then\nother dramas, and fine players in them, Forrest as Metamora or Damon or\nBrutus--John R. Scott as Tom Cringle or Rolla--or Charlotte Cushman's\nLady Gay Spanker in \"London Assurance.\" Then of some years later, at\nCastle Garden, Battery, I yet recall the splendid seasons of the Havana\nmusical troupe under Maretzek--the fine band, the cool sea-breezes,\nthe unsurpass'd vocalism--Steffan'one, Bosio, Truffi, Marini in \"Marino\nFaliero,\" \"Don Pasquale,\" or \"Favorita.\" No better playing or singing\never in New York. It was here too I afterward heard Jenny Lind. (The\nBattery--its past associations--what tales those old trees and walks and\nsea-walls could tell!)\n\n\nTHROUGH EIGHT YEARS.\n\nIn 1848, '49, I was occupied as editor of the \"daily Eagle\" newspaper,\nin Brooklyn. The latter year went off on a leisurely journey and working\nexpedition (my brother Jeff with me) through all the middle States, and\ndown the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Lived awhile in New Orleans, and\nwork'd there on the editorial staff of \"daily Crescent\" newspaper. After\na time plodded back northward, up the Mississippi, and around to, and by\nway of the great lakes, Michigan, Huron, and Erie, to Niagara falls and\nlower Canada, finally returning through central New York and down the\nHudson; traveling altogether probably 8,000 miles this trip, to and fro.\n'51, '53, occupied in house-building in Brooklyn. (For a little of\nthe first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper,\n\"the Freeman.\") '55, lost my dear father this year by death. Commenced\nputting \"Leaves of Grass\" to press for good, at the job printing office\nof my friends, the brothers Rome, in Brooklyn, after many MS. doings\nand undoings--(I had great trouble in leaving out the stock \"poetical\"\ntouches, but succeeded at last.) I am now (1856-'7) passing through my\n37th year.\n\n\nSOURCES OF CHARACTER--RESULTS--1860\n\nTo sum up the foregoing from the outset (and, of course, far, far more\nunrecorded,) I estimate three leading sources and formative stamps to\nmy own character, now solidified for good or bad, and its subsequent\nliterary and other outgrowth--the maternal nativity-stock brought\nhither from far-away Netherlands, for one, (doubtless the best)--the\nsubterranean tenacity and central bony structure (obstinacy, wilfulness)\nwhich I get from my paternal English elements, for another--and the\ncombination of my Long Island birth-spot, sea-shores, childhood's\nscenes, absorptions, with teeming Brooklyn and New York--with, I\nsuppose, my experiences afterward in the secession outbreak, for the\nthird.\n\nFor, in 1862, startled by news that my brother George, an officer in\nthe 51st New York volunteers, had been seriously wounded (first\nFredericksburg battle, December 13th,) I hurriedly went down to the\nfield of war in Virginia. But I must go back a little.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE SECESSION WAR\n\nNews of the attack on fort Sumter and _the flag_ at Charleston harbor,\nS. C., was receiv'd in New York city late at night (13th April, 1861,)\nand was immediately sent out in extras of the newspapers. I had been to\nthe opera in Fourteenth street that night, and after the performance was\nwalking down Broadway toward twelve o'clock, on my way to Brooklyn,\nwhen I heard in the distance the loud cries of the newsboys, who came\npresently tearing and yelling up the street, rushing from side to side\neven more furiously than usual. I bought an extra and cross'd to the\nMetropolitan hotel (Niblo's) where the great lamps were still brightly\nblazing, and, with a crowd of others, who gather'd impromptu, read the\nnews, which was evidently authentic. For the benefit of some who had no\npapers, one of us read the telegram aloud, while all listen'd silently\nand attentively. No remark was made by any of the crowd, which had\nincreas'd to thirty or forty, but all stood a minute or two, I remember,\nbefore they dispers'd. I can almost see them there now, under the lamps\nat midnight again.\n\n\nNATIONAL UPRISING AND VOLUNTEERING\n\nI have said somewhere that the three Presidentiads preceding 1861 show'd\nhow the weakness and wickedness of rulers are just as eligible here in\nAmerica under republican, as in Europe under dynastic influences. But\nwhat can I say of that prompt and splendid wrestling with secession\nslavery, the arch-enemy personified, the instant he unmistakably show'd\nhis face? The volcanic upheaval of the nation, after that firing on\nthe flag at Charleston, proved for certain something which had been\npreviously in great doubt, and at once substantially settled the\nquestion of disunion. In my judgment it will remain as the grandest and\nmost encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any age, old or new,\nto political progress and democracy. It was not for what came to the\nsurface merely--though that was important--but what it indicated\nbelow, which was of eternal importance. Down in the abysms of New World\nhumanity there had form'd and harden'd a primal hardpan of national\nUnion will, determin'd and in the majority, refusing to be tamper'd with\nor argued against, confronting all emergencies, and capable at any time\nof bursting all surface bonds, and breaking out like an earthquake. It\nis, indeed, the best lesson of the century, or of America, and it is\na mighty privilege to have been part of it. (Two great spectacles,\nimmortal proofs of democracy, unequall'd in all the history of the past,\nare furnish'd by the secession war--one at the beginning, the other at\nits close. Those are, the general, voluntary, arm'd upheaval, and the\npeaceful and harmonious disbanding of the armies in the summer of 1865.)\n\n\nCONTEMPTUOUS FEELING\n\nEven after the bombardment of Sumter, however, the gravity of the\nrevolt, and the power and will of the slave States for a strong and\ncontinued military resistance to national authority, were not at all\nrealized at the North, except by a few. Nine-tenths of the people of\nthe free States look'd upon the rebellion, as started in South Carolina,\nfrom a feeling one-half of contempt, and the other half composed of\nanger and incredulity. It was not thought it would be join'd in by\nVirginia, North Carolina, or Georgia. A great and cautious national\nofficial predicted that it would blow over \"in sixty days,\" and folks\ngenerally believ'd the prediction. I remember talking about it on a\nFulton ferry-boat with the Brooklyn mayor, who said he only \"hoped the\nSouthern fire-eaters would commit some overt act of resistance, as they\nwould then be at once so effectually squelch'd, we would never hear of\nsecession again--but he was afraid they never would have the pluck to\nreally do anything.\"\n\nI remember, too, that a couple of companies of the Thirteenth Brooklyn,\nwho rendezvou'd at the city armory, and started thence as thirty days'\nmen, were all provided with pieces of rope, conspicuously tied to their\nmusket-barrels, with which to bring back each man a prisoner from the\naudacious South, to be led in a noose, on our men's early and triumphant\nreturn!\n\n\nBATTLE OF BULL RUN, JULY, 1861\n\nAll this sort of feeling was destin'd to be arrested and revers'd by a\nterrible shock--the battle of first Bull Run--certainly, as we now know\nit, one of the most singular fights on record. (All battles, and their\nresults, are far more matters of accident than is generally thought; but\nthis was throughout a casualty, a chance. Each side supposed it had won,\ntill the last moment. One had, in point of fact, just the same right\nto be routed as the other. By a fiction, or series of fictions, the\nnational forces at the last moment exploded in a panic and fled from the\nfield.) The defeated troops commenced pouring into Washington over the\nLong Bridge at daylight on Monday, 22d--day drizzling all through with\nrain. The Saturday and Sunday of the battle (20th, 21st,) had been\nparch'd and hot to an extreme--the dust, the grime and smoke, in layers,\nsweated in, follow'd by other layers again sweated in, absorb'd by those\nexcited souls--their clothes all saturated with the clay-powder filling\nthe air--stirr'd up everywhere on the dry roads and trodden fields by\nthe regiments, swarming wagons, artillery, &c.--all the men with this\ncoating of murk and sweat and rain, now recoiling back, pouring over the\nLong Bridge--a horrible march of twenty miles, returning to Washington\nbaffed, humiliated, panic-struck. Where are the vaunts, and the proud\nboasts with which you went forth? Where are your banners, and your bands\nof music, and your ropes to bring back your prisoners? Well, there isn't\na band playing--and there isn't a flag but clings ashamed and lank to\nits staff.\n\nThe sun rises, but shines not. The men appear, at first sparsely and\nshame-faced enough, then thicker, in the streets of Washington--appear\nin Pennsylvania avenue, and on the steps and basement entrances. They\ncome along in disorderly mobs, some in squads, stragglers, companies.\nOccasionally, a rare regiment, in perfect order, with its officers (some\ngaps, dead, the true braves,) marching in silence, with lowering faces,\nstern, weary to sinking, all black and dirty, but every man with his\nmusket, and stepping alive; but these are the exceptions. Sidewalks\nof Pennsylvania avenue, Fourteenth street, &c., crowded, jamm'd with\ncitizens, darkies, clerks, everybody, lookers-on; women in the windows,\ncurious expressions from faces, as those swarms of dirt-cover'd return'd\nsoldiers there (will they never end?) move by; but nothing said, no\ncomments; (half our lookers-on secesh of the most venomous kind--they\nsay nothing; but the devil snickers in their faces.) During the\nforenoon Washington gets all over motley with these defeated\nsoldiers--queer-looking objects, strange eyes and faces, drench'd (the\nsteady rain drizzles on all day) and fearfully worn, hungry, haggard,\nblister'd in the feet. Good people (but not over-many of them either,)\nhurry up something for their grub. They put wash-kettles on the fire,\nfor soup, for coffee. They set tables on the side-walks--wagon-loads\nof bread are purchas'd, swiftly cut in stout chunks. Here are two aged\nladies, beautiful, the first in the city for culture and charm, they\nstand with store of eating and drink at an improvis'd table of rough\nplank, and give food, and have the store replenished from their house\nevery half-hour all that day; and there in the rain they stand, active,\nsilent, white-hair'd, and give food, though the tears stream down their\ncheeks, almost without intermission, the whole time. Amid the deep\nexcitement, crowds and motion, and desperate eagerness, it seems strange\nto see many, very many, of the soldiers sleeping--in the midst of all,\nsleeping sound. They drop down anywhere, on the steps of houses, up\nclose by the basements or fences, on the sidewalk, aside on some vacant\nlot, and deeply sleep. A poor 17 or 18 year old boy lies there, on the\nstoop of a grand house; he sleeps so calmly, so profoundly. Some clutch\ntheir muskets firmly even in sleep. Some in squads; comrades, brothers,\nclose together--and on them, as they lay, sulkily drips the rain.\n\nAs afternoon pass'd, and evening came, the streets, the bar-rooms, knots\neverywhere, listeners, questioners, terrible yarns, bugaboo, mask'd\nbatteries, our regiment all cut up, &c.--stories and story-tellers,\nwindy, bragging, vain centres of street-crowds. Resolution, manliness,\nseem to have abandon'd Washington. The principal hotel, Willard's, is\nfull of shoulder-straps--thick, crush'd, creeping with shoulder-straps.\n(I see them, and must have a word with them. There you are,\nshoulder-straps!--but where are your companies? where are your men?\nIncompetents! never tell me of chances of battle, of getting stray'd,\nand the like. I think this is your work, this retreat, after all. Sneak,\nblow, put on airs there in Willard's sumptuous parlors and bar-rooms, or\nanywhere--no explanation shall save you. Bull Run is your work; had you\nbeen half or one-tenth worthy your men, this would never have happen'd.)\n\nMeantime, in Washington, among the great persons and their entourage, a\nmixture of awful consternation, uncertainty, rage, shame, helplessness,\nand stupefying disappointment. The worst is not only imminent, but\nalready here. In a few hours--perhaps before the next meal--the secesh\ngenerals, with their victorious hordes, will be upon us. The dream of\nhumanity, the vaunted Union we thought so strong, so impregnable--lo!\nit seems already smash'd like a china plate. One bitter, bitter\nhour--perhaps proud America will never again know such an hour. She must\npack and fly--no time to spare. Those white palaces--the dome-crown'd\ncapitol there on the hill, so stately over the trees--shall they be\nleft--or destroy'd first? For it is certain that the talk among certain\nof the magnates and officers and clerks and officials everywhere, for\ntwenty-four hours in and around Washington after Bull Run, was loud\nand undisguised for yielding out and out, and substituting the southern\nrule, and Lincoln promptly abdicating and departing. If the secesh\nofficers and forces had immediately follow'd, and by a bold Napoleonic\nmovement had enter'd Washington the first day, (or even the second,)\nthey could have had things their own way, and a powerful faction north\nto back them. One of our returning colonels express'd in public that\nnight, amid a swarm of officers and gentlemen in a crowded room, the\nopinion that it was useless to fight, that the southerners had made\ntheir title clear, and that the best course for the national government\nto pursue was to desist from any further attempt at stopping them, and\nadmit them again to the lead, on the best terms they were willing to\ngrant. Not a voice was rais'd against this judgment, amid that large\ncrowd of officers and gentlemen. (The fact is, the hour was one of the\nthree or four of those crises we had then and afterward, during the\nfluctuations of four years, when human eyes appear'd at least just as\nlikely to see the last breath of the Union as to see it continue.)\n\n\nTHE STUPOR PASSES--SOMETHING ELSE BEGINS\n\nBut the hour, the day, the night pass'd, and whatever returns, an\nhour, a day, a night like that can never again return. The President,\nrecovering himself, begins that very night--sternly, rapidly sets about\nthe task of reorganizing his forces, and placing himself in positions\nfor future and surer work. If there were nothing else of Abraham Lincoln\nfor history to stamp him with, it is enough to send him with his wreath\nto the memory of all future time, that he endured that hour, that day,\nbitterer than gall--indeed a crucifixion day--that it did not conquer\nhim--that he unflinchingly stemm'd it, and resolv'd to lift himself and\nthe Union out of it.\n\nThen the great New York papers at once appear'd, (commencing that\nevening, and following it up the next morning, and incessantly through\nmany days afterwards,) with leaders that rang out over the land with\nthe loudest, most reverberating ring of clearest bugles, full\nof encouragement, hope, inspiration, unfaltering defiance; Those\nmagnificent editorials! they never flagg'd for a fortnight. The \"Herald\"\ncommenced them--I remember the articles well. The \"Tribune\" was equally\ncogent and inspiriting--and the \"Times,\" \"Evening Post,\" and other\nprincipal papers, were not a whit behind. They came in good time,\nfor they were needed. For in the humiliation of Bull Run, the popular\nfeeling north, from its extreme of superciliousness, recoil'd to the\ndepth of gloom and apprehension.\n\n(Of all the days of the war, there are two especially I can never\nforget. Those were the day following the news, in New York and Brooklyn,\nof that first Bull Run defeat, and the day of Abraham Lincoln's death.\nI was home in Brooklyn on both occasions. The day of the murder we heard\nthe news very early in the morning. Mother prepared breakfast--and\nother meals afterward--as usual; but not a mouthful was eaten all day by\neither of us. We each drank half a cup of coffee; that was all. Little\nwas said. We got every newspaper morning and evening, and the frequent\nextras of that period, and pass'd them silently to each other.)\n\n\nDOWN AT THE FRONT\n\nFALMOUTH, VA., _opposite Fredericksburgh, December 21, 1862_.--Begin my\nvisits among the camp hospitals in the army of the Potomac. Spend a\ngood part of the day in a large brick mansion on the banks of the\nRappahannock, used as a hospital since the battle--seems to have\nreceiv'd only the worst cases. Out doors, at the foot of a tree, within\nten yards of the front of the house, I notice a heap of amputated feet,\nlegs, arms, hands, &c., a full load for a one-horse cart. Several dead\nbodies lie near, each cover'd with its brown woolen blanket. In the\ndoor-yard, towards the river, are fresh graves, mostly of officers,\ntheir names on pieces of arrel-staves or broken boards, stuck in the\ndirt. (Most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported\nnorth to their friends.) The large mansion is quite crowded upstairs\nand down, everything impromptu, no system, all bad enough, but I have\nno doubt the best that can be done; all the wounds pretty bad, some\nfrightful, the men in their old clothes, unclean and bloody. Some of\nthe wounded are rebel soldiers and officers, prisoners. One, a\nMississippian, a captain, hit badly in leg, I talk'd with some time; he\nask'd me for papers, which I gave him. (I saw him three months afterward\nin Washington, with his leg amputated, doing well.) I went through the\nrooms, downstairs and up. Some of the men were dying. I had nothing to\ngive at that visit, but wrote a few letters to folks home, mothers, &c.\nAlso talk'd to three or four, who seem'd most susceptible to it, and\nneeding it.\n\n\nAFTER FIRST FREDERICKSBURG\n\n_December 23 to 31_.--The results of the late battle are exhibited\neverywhere about here in thousands of cases, (hundreds die every day,)\nin the camp, brigade, and division hospitals. These are merely tents,\nand sometimes very poor ones, the wounded lying on the ground, lucky if\ntheir blankets are spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs, or small\nleaves. No cots; seldom even a mattress. It is pretty cold. The ground\nis frozen hard, and there is occasional snow. I go around from one case\nto another. I do not see that I do much good to these wounded and dying;\nbut I cannot leave them. Once in a while some youngster holds on to me\nconvulsively, and I do what I can for him; at any rate, stop with him\nand sit near him for hours, if he wishes it.\n\nBesides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the\ncamps, talking with the men, &c. Sometimes at night among the groups\naround the fires, in their shebang enclosures of bushes. These are\ncurious shows, full of characters and groups. I soon get acquainted\nanywhere in camp, with officers or men, and am always well used.\nSometimes I go down on picket with the regiments I know best. As to\nrations, the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied,\nand the men have enough, such as it is, mainly salt pork and hard tack.\nMost of the regiments lodge in the flimsy little shelter-tents. A few\nhave built themselves huts of logs and mud, with fire-places.\n\n\nBACK TO WASHINGTON\n\n_January, '63_.--Left camp at Falmouth, with some wounded, a few days\nsince, and came here by Aquia creek railroad, and so on government\nsteamer up the Potomac. Many wounded were with us on the cars and boat.\nThe cars were just common platform ones. The railroad journey of ten or\ntwelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The soldiers guarding the\nroad came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair\nand half-awake look. Those on duty were walking their posts, some on\nbanks over us, others down far below the level of the track. I saw\nlarge cavalry camps off the road. At Aquia creek landing were numbers\nof wounded going north. While I waited some three hours, I went around\namong them. Several wanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives,\n&c., which I did for them, (by mail the next day from Washington.) On\nthe boat I had my hands full. One poor fellow died going up.\n\nI am now remaining in and around Washington, daily visiting the\nhospitals. Am much in Patent-office, Eighth street, H street,\nArmory-square, and others. Am now able to do a little good, having\nmoney, (as almoner of others home,) and getting experience. To-day,\nSunday afternoon and till nine in the evening, visited Campbell\nhospital; attended specially to one case in ward I, very sick with\npleurisy and typhoid fever, young man, farmer's son, D. F. Russell,\ncompany E, 60th New York, downhearted and feeble; a long time before he\nwould take any interest; wrote a letter home to his mother, in Malone,\nFranklin county, N. Y., at his request; gave him some fruit and one\nor two other gifts; envelop'd and directed his letter, &c. Then went\nthoroughly through ward 6, observ'd every case in the ward, without, I\nthink, missing one; gave perhaps from twenty to thirty persons, each one\nsome little gift, such as oranges, apples, sweet crackers, figs, &c.\n\n_Thursday, Jan. 21._--Devoted the main part of the day to Armory-square\nhospital; went pretty thoroughly through wards F, G, H, and I; some\nfifty cases in each ward. In ward F supplied the men throughout with\nwriting paper and stamp'd envelope each; distributed in small portions,\nto proper subjects, a large jar of first-rate preserv'd berries, which\nhad been donated to me by a lady--her own cooking. Found several cases\nI thought good subjects for small sums of money, which I furnish'd. (The\nwounded men often come up broke, and it helps their spirits to have\neven the small sum I give them.) My paper and envelopes all gone, but\ndistributed a good lot of amusing reading matter; also, as I thought\njudicious, tobacco, oranges, apples, &c. Interesting cases in ward I;\nCharles Miller, bed 19, company D, 53d Pennsylvania, is only 16 years\nof age, very bright, courageous boy, left leg amputated below the knee;\nnext bed to him, another young lad very sick; gave each appropriate\ngifts. In the bed above, also, amputation of the left leg; gave him a\nlittle jar of raspberries; bed J, this ward, gave a small sum; also to\na soldier on crutches, sitting on his bed near.... (I am more and more\nsurprised at the very great proportion of youngsters from fifteen to\ntwenty-one in the army. I afterwards found a still greater proportion\namong the southerners.)\n\nEvening, same day, went to see D. F. R., before alluded to; found him\nremarkably changed for the better; up and dress'd--quite a triumph; he\nafterwards got well, and went back to his regiment.\n\nDistributed in the wards a quantity of note-paper, and forty or fifty\nstamp'd envelopes, of which I had recruited my stock, and the men were\nmuch in need.\n\n\nFIFTY HOURS LEFT WOUNDED ON THE FIELD\n\nHere is a case of a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the\nPatent-office. He likes to have some one to talk to, and we will listen\nto him. He got badly hit in his leg and side at Fredericksburgh that\neventful Saturday, 13th of December. He lay the succeeding two days and\nnights helpless on the field, between the city and those grim terraces\nof batteries; his company and regiment had been compell'd to leave him\nto his fate. To make matters worse, it happen'd he lay with his head\nslightly down hill, and could not help himself. At the end of some fifty\nhours he was brought off, with other wounded, under a flag of truce. I\nask him how the rebels treated him as he lay during those two days and\nnights within reach of them--whether they came to him--whether they\nabused him? He answers that several of the rebels, soldiers and\nothers, came to him at one time and another. A couple of them, who\nwere together, spoke roughly and sarcastically, but nothing worse. One\nmiddle-aged man, however, who seem'd to be moving around the field,\namong the dead and wounded, for benevolent purposes, came to him in\na way he will never forget; treated our soldier kindly, bound up his\nwounds, cheer'd him, gave him a couple of biscuits and a drink of\nwhiskey and water; asked him if he could eat some beef. This good\nsecesh, however, did not change our soldier's position, for it might\nhave caused the blood to burst from the wounds, clotted and stagnated.\nOur soldier is from Pennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time; the\nwounds proved to be bad ones. But he retains a good heart, and is at\npresent on the gain. (It is not uncommon for the men to remain on the\nfield this way, one, two, or even four or five days.)\n\n\nHOSPITAL SCENES AND PERSONS\n\n_Letter Writing_.--When eligible, I encourage the men to write, and\nmyself, when called upon, write all sorts of letters for them (including\nlove letters, very tender ones.) Almost as I reel off these memoranda, I\nwrite for a new patient to his wife. M. de F., of the 17th Connecticut,\ncompany H, has just come up (February 17th) from Windmill point, and is\nreceived in ward H, Armory-square. He is an intelligent looking man, has\na foreign accent, black-eyed and hair'd, a Hebraic appearance. Wants a\ntelegraphic message sent to his wife, New Canaan, Conn. I agree to send\nthe message--but to make things sure I also sit down and write the wife\na letter, and despatch it to the post-office immediately, as he fears\nshe will come on, and he does not wish her to, as he will surely get\nwell.\n\n_Saturday, January 30th._--Afternoon, visited Campbell hospital. Scene\nof cleaning up the ward, and giving the men all clean clothes--through\nthe ward (6) the patients dressing or being dress'd--the naked upper\nhalf of the bodies--the good-humor and fun--the shirts, drawers, sheets\nof beds, &c., and the general fixing up for Sunday. Gave J. L. 50 cents.\n\n_Wednesday, February 4th._--Visited Armory-square hospital, went pretty\nthoroughly through wards E and D. Supplied paper and envelopes to all\nwho wish'd--as usual, found plenty of men who needed those articles.\nWrote letters. Saw and talk'd with two or three members of the Brooklyn\n14th regt. A poor fellow in ward D, with a fearful wound in a fearful\ncondition, was having some loose splinters of bone taken from the\nneighborhood of the wound. The operation was long, and one of great\npain--yet, after it was well commenced, the soldier bore it in silence.\nHe sat up, propp'd--was much wasted--had lain a long time quiet in one\nposition (not for days only but weeks,) a bloodless, brown-skinn'd face,\nwith eyes full of determination--belong'd to a New York regiment. There\nwas an unusual cluster of surgeons, medical cadets, nurses, &c., around\nhis bed--I thought the whole thing was done with tenderness, and done\nwell. In one case, the wife sat by the side of her husband, his sickness\ntyphoid fever, pretty bad. In another, by the side of her son, a\nmother--she told me she had seven children, and this was the youngest.\n(A fine, kind, healthy, gentle mother, good-looking, not very old, with\na cap on her head, and dress'd like home--what a charm it gave to the\nwhole ward.) I liked the woman nurse in ward E--I noticed how she sat\na long time by a poor fellow who just had, that morning, in addition to\nhis other sickness, bad hemorrhage--she gently assisted him, reliev'd\nhim of the blood, holding a cloth to his mouth, as he coughed it up--he\nwas so weak he could only just turn his head over on the pillow.\n\nOne young New York man, with a bright, handsome face, had been lying\nseveral months from a most disagreeable wound, receiv'd at Bull Run. A\nbullet had shot him right through the bladder, hitting him front, low in\nthe belly, and coming out back. He had suffer'd much--the water came out\nof the wound, by slow but steady quantities, for many weeks--so that\nhe lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle--and there were other\ndisagreeable circumstances. He was of good heart, however. At present\ncomparatively comfortable, had a bad throat, was delighted with a stick\nof horehound candy I gave him, with one or two other trifles.\n\n\nPATENT-OFFICE HOSPITAL\n\n_February 23._--I must not let the great hospital at the Patent-office\npass away without some mention. A few weeks ago the vast area of the\nsecond story of that noblest of Washington buildings was crowded close\nwith rows of sick, badly wounded and dying soldiers. They were placed in\nthree very large apartments. I went there many times. It was a strange,\nsolemn, and, with all its features of suffering and death, a sort\nof fascinating sight. I go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve\nparticular cases. Two of the immense apartments are fill'd with high and\nponderous glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of\nutensil, machine or invention, it ever enter'd into the mind of man to\nconceive; and with curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases\nare lateral openings, perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep, and in\nthese were placed the sick, besides a great long double row of them\nup and down through the middle of the hall. Many of them were very bad\ncases, wounds and amputations. Then there was a gallery running above\nthe hall in which there were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene,\nespecially at night when lit up. The glass cases, the beds, the forms\nlying there, the gallery above, and the marble pavement under\nfoot--the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in various\ndegrees--occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be\nrepress'd--sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy\neye, the nurse by his side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no\nrelative--such were the sights but lately in the Patent-office. (The\nwounded have since been removed from there, and it is now vacant again.)\n\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BY MOONLIGHT\n\n_February 24th._--A spell of fine soft weather. I wander about a good\ndeal, sometimes at night under the moon. Tonight took a long look at\nthe President's house. The white portico--the palace-like, tall,\nround columns, spotless as snow--the walls also--the tender and\nsoft moonlight, flooding the pale marble, and making peculiar faint\nlanguishing shades, not shadows--everywhere a soft transparent\nhazy, thin, blue moon-lace, hanging in the air--the brilliant and\nextra-plentiful clusters of gas, on and around the facade, columns,\nportico, &c.--everything so white, so marbly pure and dazzling, yet\nsoft--the White House of future poems, and of dreams and dramas, there\nin the soft and copious moon--the gorgeous front, in the trees, under\nthe lustrous flooding moon, full of realty, full of illusion--the forms\nof the trees, leafless, silent, in trunk and myriad--angles of branches,\nunder the stars and sky--the White House of the land, and of beauty and\nnight--sentries at the gates, and by the portico, silent, pacing there\nin blue overcoats--stopping you not at all, but eyeing you with sharp\neyes, whichever way you move.\n\n\nAN ARMY HOSPITAL WARD\n\nLet me specialize a visit I made to the collection of barrack-like\none-story edifices, Campbell hospital, out on the flats, at the end\nof the then horse railway route, on Seventh street. There is a long\nbuilding appropriated to each ward. Let us go into ward 6. It contains,\nto-day, I should judge, eighty or a hundred patients, half sick, half\nwounded. The edifice is nothing but boards, well whitewash'd inside, and\nthe usual slender-framed iron bedsteads, narrow and plain. You walk down\nthe central passage, with a row on either side, their feet towards you,\nand their heads to the wall. There are fires in large stoves, and the\nprevailing white of the walls is reliev'd by some ornaments, stars,\ncircles, &c., made of evergreens. The view of the whole edifice and\noccupants can be taken at once, for there is no partition. You may hear\ngroans or other sounds of unendurable suffering from two or three of\nthe cots, but in the main there is quiet--almost a painful absence of\ndemonstration; but the pallid face, the dull'd eye, and the moisture\nof the lip, are demonstration enough. Most of these sick or hurt are\nevidently young fellows from the country, farmers' sons, and such like.\nLook at the fine large frames, the bright and broad countenances, and\nthe many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique. Look\nat the patient and mute manner of our American wounded as they lie in\nsuch a sad collection; representatives from all New England, and from\nNew York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--indeed from all the States\nand all the cities--largely from the west. Most of them are entirely\nwithout friends or acquaintances here--no familiar face, and hardly a\nword of judicious sympathy or cheer, through their sometimes long and\ntedious sickness, or the pangs of aggravated wounds.\n\n\nA CONNECTICUT CASE\n\nThis young man in bed 25 is H. D. B. of the 27th Connecticut, company\nB. His folks live at Northford, near New Haven. Though not more than\ntwenty-one, or thereabouts, he has knock'd much around the world, on sea\nand land, and has seen some fighting on both. When I first saw him he\nwas very sick, with no appetite. He declined offers of money--said\nhe did not need anything. As I was quite anxious to do something,\nhe confess'd that he had a hankering for a good home-made rice\npudding--thought he could relish it better than anything. At this\ntime his stomach was very weak. (The doctor, whom I consulted, said\nnourishment would do him more good than anything; but things in the\nhospital, though better than usual, revolted him.) I soon procured B.\nhis rice pudding. A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish,\nmade the pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He\nsubsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days. This B. is\na good sample of the American eastern young man--the typical Yankee.\nI took a fancy to him, and gave him a nice pipe for a keepsake. He\nreceiv'd afterwards a box of things from home, and nothing would do but\nI must take dinner with him, which I did, and a very good one it was.\n\n\nTWO BROOKLYN BOYS\n\nHere in this same ward are two young men from Brooklyn, members of the\n51st New York. I had known both the two as young lads at home, so they\nseem near to me. One of them, J. L., lies there with an amputated\narm, the stump healing pretty well. (I saw him lying on the ground at\nFredericksburgh last December, all bloody, just after the arm was taken\noff. He was very phlegmatic about it, munching away at a cracker in the\nremaining hand--made no fuss.) He will recover, and thinks and talks yet\nof meeting Johnny Rebs.\n\n\nA SECESH BRAVE\n\nThe grand soldiers are not comprised in those of one side, any more\nthan the other. Here is a sample of an unknown southerner, a lad\nof seventeen. At the War department, a few days ago, I witness'd a\npresentation of captured flags to the Secretary. Among others a soldier\nnamed Gant, of the 104th Ohio volunteers, presented a rebel battle-flag,\nwhich one of the officers stated to me was borne to the mouth of our\ncannon and planted there by a boy but seventeen years of age, who\nactually endeavor'd to stop the muzzle of the gun with fence-rails. He\nwas kill'd in the effort, and the flag-staff was sever'd by a shot from\none of our men.\n\n\nTHE WOUNDED FROM CHANCELLORSVILLE\n\n_May '63_.--As I write this, the wounded have begun to arrive from\nHooker's command from bloody Chancellorsville. I was down among the\nfirst arrivals. The men in charge told me the bad cases were yet to\ncome. If that is so I pity them, for these are bad enough. You ought to\nsee the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here at the foot of\nSixth street, at night. Two boat loads came about half-past seven last\nnight. A little after eight it rain'd a long and violent shower. The\npale, helpless soldiers had been debark'd, and lay around on the wharf\nand neighborhood anywhere. The rain was, probably, grateful to them;\nat any rate they were exposed to it. The few torches light up the\nspectacle. All around--on the wharf, on the ground, out on side\nplaces--the men are lying on blankets, old quilts, &c., with bloody rags\nbound round heads, arms, and legs. The attendants are few, and at\nnight few outsiders also--only a few hard-work'd transportation men\nand drivers. (The wounded are getting to be common, and people grow\ncallous.) The men, whatever their condition, lie there, and patiently\nwait till their turn comes to be taken up. Near by, the ambulances are\nnow arriving in clusters, and one after another is call'd to back up\nand take its load. Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers. The men\ngenerally make little or no ado, whatever their sufferings. A few groans\nthat cannot be suppress'd, and occasionally a scream of pain as they\nlift a man into the ambulance. To-day, as I write, hundreds more are\nexpected, and to-morrow and the next day more, and so on for many days.\nQuite often they arrive at the rate of 1000 a day.\n\n\nA NIGHT BATTLE OVER A WEEK SINCE\n\n_May 12_.--There was part of the late battle at Chancellorsville,\n(second Fredericksburgh,) a little over a week ago, Saturday, Saturday\nnight and Sunday, under Gen. Joe Hooker, I would like to give just a\nglimpse of--(a moment's look in a terrible storm at sea--of which a few\nsuggestions are enough, and full details impossible.) The fighting had\nbeen very hot during the day, and after an intermission the latter part,\nwas resumed at night, and kept up with furious energy till 3 o'clock in\nthe morning. That afternoon (Saturday) an attack sudden and strong by\nStonewall Jackson had gain'd a great advantage to the southern army, and\nbroken our lines, entering us like a wedge, and leaving things in that\nposition at dark. But Hooker at 11 at night made a desperate push, drove\nthe secesh forces back, restored his original lines, and resumed his\nplans. This night scrimmage was very exciting, and afforded countless\nstrange and fearful pictures. The fighting had been general both at\nChancellorsville and northeast at Fredericksburgh. (We hear of some poor\nfighting, episodes, skedaddling on our part. I think not of it. I\nthink of the fierce bravery, the general rule.) One corps, the 6th,\nSedgewick's, fights four dashing and bloody battles in thirty-six hours,\nretreating in great jeopardy, losing largely but maintaining itself,\nfighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances, getting\nover the Rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth, yet getting over.\nIt lost many, many brave men, yet it took vengeance, ample vengeance.\n\nBut it was the tug of Saturday evening, and through the night and Sunday\nmorning, I wanted to make a special note of. It was largely in the\nwoods, and quite a general engagement. The night was very pleasant, at\ntimes the moon shining out full and clear, all Nature so calm in itself,\nthe early summer grass so rich, and foliage of the trees--yet there the\nbattle raging, and many good fellows lying helpless, with new accessions\nto them, and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of\ncannon, (for there was an artillery contest too,) the red life-blood\noozing out from heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dew-cool\ngrass. Patches of the woods take fire, and several of the wounded,\nunable to move, are consumed--quite large spaces are swept over, burning\nthe dead also--some of the men have their hair and beards singed--some,\nburns on their faces and hands--others holes burnt in their clothing.\nThe flashes of fire from the cannon, the quick flaring flames and smoke,\nand the immense roar--the musketry so general, the light nearly bright\nenough for each side to see the other--the crashing, tramping of\nmen--the yelling--close quarters--we hear the secesh yells--our men\ncheer loudly back, especially if Hooker is in sight--hand to hand\nconflicts, each side stands up to it, brave, determin'd as demons, they\noften charge upon us--a thousand deeds are done worth to write newer\ngreater poems on--and still the woods on fire--still many are not only\nscorch'd--too many, unable to move, are burned to death.\n\nThen the camps of the wounded--O heavens, what scene is this?--is this\nindeed _humanity_--these butchers' shambles? There are several of them.\nThere they lie, in the largest, in an open space in the woods, from 200\nto 300 poor fellows--the groans and screams--the odor of blood,\nmixed with the fresh scent of the night, the grass, the trees--that\nslaughter-house! O well is it their mothers, their sisters cannot see\nthem--cannot conceive, and never conceiv'd, these things. One man is\nshot by a shell, both in the arm and leg--both are amputated--there\nlie the rejected members. Some have their legs blown off--some bullets\nthrough the breast--some indescribably horrid wounds in the face\nor head, all mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out--some in the\nabdomen--some mere boys--many rebels, badly hurt--they take their\nregular turns with the rest, just the same as any--the surgeons use\nthem just the same. Such is the camp of the wounded--such a fragment, a\nreflection afar off of the bloody scene--while all over the clear, large\nmoon comes out at times softly, quietly shining. Amid the woods,\nthat scene of flitting souls--amid the crack and crash and yelling\nsounds--the impalpable perfume of the woods--and yet the pungent,\nstifling smoke--the radiance of the moon, looking from heaven at\nintervals so placid--the sky so heavenly the clear-obscure up there,\nthose buoyant upper oceans--a few large placid stars beyond, coming\nsilently and languidly out, and then disappearing--the melancholy,\ndraperied night above, around. And there, upon the roads, the fields,\nand in those woods, that contest, never one more desperate in any age or\nland--both parties now in force--masses--no fancy battle, no semi-play,\nbut fierce and savage demons fighting there--courage and scorn of death\nthe rule, exceptions almost none.\n\nWhat history, I say, can ever give--for who can know--the mad,\ndetermin'd tussle of the armies, in all their separate large and little\nsquads--as this--each steep'd from crown to toe in desperate, mortal\npurports? Who know the conflict, hand-to-hand--the many conflicts in\nthe dark, those shadowy-tangled, flashing moonbeam'd woods--the\nwrithing groups and squads--the cries, the din, the cracking guns and\npistols--the distant cannon--the cheers and calls and threats and\nawful music of the oaths--the indescribable mix--the officers'\norders, persuasions, encouragements--the devils fully rous'd in human\nhearts--the strong shout, _Charge, men, charge_--the flash of the naked\nsword, and rolling flame and smoke? And still the broken, clear and\nclouded heaven--and still again the moonlight pouring silvery soft its\nradiant patches over all. Who paint the scene, the sudden partial panic\nof the afternoon, at dusk? Who paint the irrepressible advance of the\nsecond division of the Third corps, under Hooker himself, suddenly\norder'd up--those rapid-filing phantoms through the woods? Who show what\nmoves there in the shadows, fluid and firm--to save, (and it did save,)\nthe army's name, perhaps the nation? as there the veterans hold the\nfield. (Brave Berry falls not yet--but death has mark'd him--soon he\nfalls.)\n\n\nUNNAMED REMAINS THE BRAVEST SOLDIER\n\nOf scenes like these, I say, who writes--whoe'er can write the story? Of\nmany a score--aye, thousands, north and south, of unwrit heroes, unknown\nheroisms, incredible, impromptu, first-class desperations--who tells?\nNo history ever--no poem sings, no music sounds, those bravest men of\nall--those deeds. No formal general's report, nor book in the library,\nnorcolumn in the paper, embalms the bravest, north or south, east or\nwest. Unnamed, unknown, remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers.\nOur manliest--our boys--our hardy darlings; no picture gives them.\nLikely, the typic one of them (standing, no doubt, for hundreds,\nthousands,) crawls aside to some bush-clump, or ferny tuft, on receiving\nhis death-shot--there sheltering a little while, soaking roots, grass\nand soil, with red blood--the battle advances, retreats, flits from the\nscene, sweeps by--and there, haply with pain and suffering (yet less,\nfar less, than is supposed,) the last lethargy winds like a serpent\nround him--the eyes glaze in death----none recks--perhaps the\nburial-squads, in truce, a week afterwards, search not the secluded\nspot--and there, at last, the Bravest Soldier crumbles in mother earth,\nunburied and unknown.\n\n\nSOME SPECIMEN CASES\n\n_June 18th_.--In one of the hospitals I find Thomas Haley, company M,\n4th New York cavalry--a regular Irish boy, a fine specimen of youthful\nphysical manliness--shot through the lungs--inevitably dying--came\nover to this country from Ireland to enlist--has not a single friend or\nacquaintance here--is sleeping soundly at this moment, (but it is the\nsleep of death)--has a bullet-hole straight through the lung. I saw Tom\nwhen first brought here, three days since, and didn't suppose he could\nlive twelve hours--(yet he looks well enough in the face to a casual\nobserver.) He lies there with his frame exposed above the waist, all\nnaked, for coolness, a fine built man, the tan not yet bleach'd from his\ncheeks and neck. It is useless to talk to him, as with his sad hurt, and\nthe stimulants they give him, and the utter strangeness of every object,\nface, furniture, &c., the poor fellow, even when awake, is like some\nfrighten'd, shy animal. Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps.\n(Sometimes I thought he knew more than he show'd.) I often come and sit\nby him in perfect silence; he will breathe for ten minutes as softly and\nevenly as a young babe asleep. Poor youth, so handsome, athletic, with\nprofuse beautiful shining hair. One time as I sat looking at him while\nhe lay asleep, he suddenly, without the least start, awaken'd, open'd\nhis eyes, gave me a long steady look, turning his face very slightly to\ngaze easier--one long, clear, silent look--a slight sigh--then turn'd\nback and went into his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken\nboy, the heart of the stranger that hover'd near.\n\n_W.H.E., Co. F, 2nd N.Y._--His disease is pneumonia. He lay sick at\nthe wretched hospital below Aquia creek, for seven or eight days before\nbrought here. He was detail'd from his regiment to go there and help\nas nurse, but was soon taken down himself. Is an elderly, sallow-faced,\nrather gaunt, gray-hair'd man, a widower, with children. He express'd a\ngreat desire for good, strong green tea. An excellent lady, Mrs. W.,\nof Washington, soon sent him a package; also a small sum of money. The\ndoctor said give him the tea at pleasure; it lay on the table by his\nside, and he used it every day. He slept a great deal; could not talk\nmuch, as he grew deaf. Occupied bed 15, ward I, Armory. (The same lady\nabove, Mrs. W., sent the men a large package of tobacco.)\n\nJ. G. lies in bed 52, ward I; is of company B, 7th Pennsylvania. I\ngave him a small sum of money, some tobacco, and envelopes. To a man\nadjoining also gave twenty-five cents; he flush'd in the face when I\noffer'd it--refused at first, but as I found he had not a cent, and was\nvery fond of having the daily papers to read, I prest it on him. He was\nevidently very grateful, but said little.\n\nJ.T.L., of company F, 9th New Hampshire, lies in bed 37, ward I. Is\nvery fond of tobacco. I furnish him some; also with a little money. Has\ngangrene of the feet; a pretty bad case; will surely have to lose three\ntoes. Is a regular specimen of an old-fashion'd, rude, hearty, New\nEngland countryman, impressing me with his likeness to that celebrated\nsinged cat, who was better than she look'd.\n\nBed 3, ward E, Armory, has a great hankering for pickles, something\npungent. After consulting the doctor, I gave him a small bottle of\nhorse-radish; also some apples; also a book. Some of the nurses\nare excellent. The woman-nurse in this ward I like very much. (Mrs.\nWright--a year afterwards I found her in Mansion house hospital,\nAlexandria--she is a perfect nurse.)\n\nIn one bed a young man, Marcus Small, company K, 7th Maine--sick with\ndysentery and typhoid fever--pretty critical case--I talk with him\noften--he thinks he will die--looks like it indeed. I write a letter for\nhim home to East Livermore, Maine--I let him talk to me a little,\nbut not much, advise him to keep very quiet--do most of the talking\nmyself--stay quite a while with him, as he holds on to my hand--talk\nto him in a cheering, but slow, low and measured manner--talk about his\nfurlough, and going home as soon as he is able to travel.\n\nThomas Lindly, 1st Pennsylvania cavalry, shot very badly through the\nfoot--poor young man, he suffers horridly, has to be constantly dosed\nwith morphine, his face ashy and glazed, bright young eyes--I give him\na large handsome apple, lay it in sight, tell him to have it roasted\nin the morning, as he generally feels easier then, and can eat a little\nbreakfast. I write two letters for him.\n\nOpposite, an old Quaker lady sits by the side of her son, Amer Moore,\n2d U. S. artillery--shot in the head two weeks since, very low, quite\nrational--from hips down paralyzed--he will surely die. I speak a very\nfew words to him every day and evening--he answers pleasantly--wants\nnothing--(he told me soon after he came about his home affairs,\nhis mother had been an invalid, and he fear'd to let her know his\ncondition.) He died soon after she came.\n\n\nMY PREPARATIONS FOR VISITS\n\nIn my visits to the hospitals I found it was in the simple matter of\npersonal presence, and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism, that I\nsucceeded and help'd more than by medical nursing, or delicacies,\nor gifts of money, or anything else. During the war I possess'd the\nperfection of physical health. My habit, when practicable, was to\nprepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours of from\na couple to four or five hours, by fortifying myself with previous rest,\nthe bath, clean clothes, a good meal, and as cheerful an appearance as\npossible.\n\n\nAMBULANCE PROCESSIONS\n\n_June 23, Sundown._--As I sit writing this paragraph I see a train of\nabout thirty huge four-horse wagons, used as ambulances, fill'd with\nwounded, passing up Fourteenth street, on their way, probably, to\nColumbian, Carver, and Mount Pleasant hospitals. This is the way the men\ncome in now, seldom in small numbers, but almost always in these long,\nsad processions. Through the past winter, while our army lay opposite\nFredericksburg, the like strings of ambulances were of frequent\noccurrence along Seventh street, passing slowly up from the steamboat\nwharf, with loads from Aquia creek.\n\n\nBAD WOUNDS--THE YOUNG\n\nThe soldiers are nearly all young men, and far more American than is\ngenerally supposed--I should say nine-tenths are native-born. Among\nthe arrivals from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of Ohio,\nIndiana, and Illinois men. As usual, there are all sorts of wounds. Some\nof the men fearfully burnt from the explosions of artillery caissons.\nOne ward has a long row of officers, some with ugly hurts. Yesterday was\nperhaps worse than usual. Amputations are going on--the attendants are\ndressing wounds. As you pass by, you must be on your guard where\nyou look. I saw the other day a gentlemen, a visitor apparently from\ncuriosity, in one of the wards, stop and turn a moment to look at an\nawful wound they were probing. He turn'd pale, and in a moment more he\nhad fainted away and fallen to the floor.\n\n\nTHE MOST INSPIRITING OF ALL WAR'S SHOWS\n\n_June 29._--Just before sundown this evening a very large cavalry force\nwent by--a fine sight. The men evidently had seen service. First came a\nmounted band of sixteen bugles, drums and cymbals, playing wild martial\ntunes--made my heart jump. Then the principal officers, then company\nafter company, with their officers at their heads, making of course the\nmain part of the cavalcade; then a long train of men with led horses,\nlots of mounted negroes with special horses--and a long string of\nbaggage-wagons, each drawn by four horses--and then a motley rear guard.\n\nIt was a pronouncedly warlike and gay show; the sabres clank'd, the men\nlook'd young and healthy and strong; the electric tramping of so many\nhorses on the hard road, and the gallant bearing, fine seat, and bright\nfaced appearance of a thousand and more handsome young American men,\nwere so good to see. An hour later another troop went by, smaller in\nnumbers, perhaps three hundred men. They too look'd like serviceable\nmen, campaigners used to field and fight.\n\n_July 3_.--This forenoon, for more than an hour, again long strings\nof cavalry, several regiments, very fine men and horses, four or five\nabreast. I saw them in Fourteenth street, coming in town from north.\nSeveral hundred extra horses, some of the mares with colts, trotting\nalong. (Appear'd to be a number of prisoners too.) How inspiriting\nalways the cavalry regiments. Our men are generally well mounted, feel\ngood, are young, gay on the saddle, their blankets in a roll behind\nthem, their sabres clanking at their sides. This noise and movement\nand the tramp of many horses' hoofs has a curious effect upon one. The\nbugles play--presently you hear them afar off, deaden'd, mix'd with\nother noises. Then just as they had all pass'd, a string of ambulances\ncommenc'd from the other way, moving up Fourteenth street north, slowly\nwending along, bearing a large lot of wounded to the hospitals.\n\n\nBATTLE OF GETTYSBURG\n\n_July 4th_.--The weather to-day, upon the whole, is very fine, warm,\nbut from a smart rain last night, fresh enough, and no dust, which is\na great relief for this city. I saw the parade about noon, Pennsylvania\navenue, from Fifteenth street down toward the capitol. There were three\nregiments of infantry, (I suppose the ones doing patrol duty here,) two\nor three societies of Odd Fellows, a lot of children in barouches, and\na squad of policemen. (A useless imposition upon the soldiers--they have\nwork enough on their backs without piling the like of this.)\n\nAs I went down the Avenue, saw a big flaring placard on the bulletin\nboard of a newspaper office, announcing \"Glorious Victory for the Union\nArmy!\" Meade had fought Lee at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, yesterday and\nday before, and repuls'd him most signally, taken 3,000 prisoners, &c.\n(I afterwards saw Meade's despatch, very modest, and a sort of order of\nthe day from the President himself, quite religious, giving thanks to\nthe Supreme, and calling on the people to do the same.)\n\nI walk'd on to Armory hospital--took along with me several bottles of\nblackberry and cherry syrup, good and strong, but innocent. Went through\nseveral of the wards, announc'd to the soldiers the news from Meade,\nand gave them all a good drink of the syrups with ice water, quite\nrefreshing--prepar'd it all myself, and serv'd it around. Meanwhile the\nWashington bells are ringing their sun-down peals for Fourth of July,\nand the usual fusilades of boys' pistols, crackers, and guns.\n\n\nA CAVALRY CAMP\n\nI am writing this, nearly sundown, watching a cavalry company (acting\nSignal service,) just come in through a shower, making their night's\ncamp ready on some broad, vacant ground, a sort of hill, in full view\nopposite my window. There are the men in their yellow-striped jackets.\nAll are dismounted; the freed horses stand with drooping heads and wet\nsides; they are to be led off presently in groups, to water. The little\nwall-tents and shelter tents spring up quickly. I see the fires already\nblazing, and pots and kettles over them. Some among the men are driving\nin tent-poles, wielding their axes with strong, slow blows. I see great\nhuddles of horses, bundles of hay, groups of men (some with unbuckled\nsabres yet on their sides,) a few officers, piles of wood, the flames\nof the fires, saddles, harness, &c. The smoke streams upward, additional\nmen arrive and dismount--some drive in stakes, and tie their horses to\nthem; some go with buckets for water, some are chopping wood, and so on.\n\n_July 6th_.--A steady rain, dark and thick and warm. A train of six-mule\nwagons has just pass'd bearing pontoons, great square-end flatboats, and\nthe heavy planking for overlaying them. We hear that the Potomac above\nhere is flooded, and are wondering whether Lee will be able to get back\nacross again, or whether Meade will indeed break him to pieces. The\ncavalry camp on the hill is a ceaseless field of observation for me.\nThis forenoon there stand the horses, tether'd together, dripping,\nsteaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping\nalso. The fires are half quench'd.\n\n_July 10th_.--Still the camp opposite--perhaps fifty or sixty tents.\nSome of the men are cleaning their sabres (pleasant to-day,) some\nbrushing boots, some laying off, reading, writing--some cooking, some\nsleeping. On long temporary cross-sticks back of the tents are cavalry\naccoutrements--blankets and overcoats are hung out to air--there are the\nsquads of horses tether'd, feeding, continually stamping and whisking\ntheir tails to keep off flies. I sit long in my third story window and\nlook at the scene--a hundred little things going on--peculiar objects\nconnected with the camp that could not be described, any one of them\njustly, without much minute drawing and coloring in words.\n\n\nA NEW YORK SOLDIER\n\nThis afternoon, July 22d, I have spent a long time with Oscar F. Wilber,\ncompany G, 154th New York, low with chronic diarrhoea, and a bad\nwound also. He asked me to read him a chapter in the New Testament.\nI complied, and ask'd him what I should read. He said, \"Make your\nown choice.\" I open'd at the close of one of the first books of the\nevangelists, and read the chapters describing the latter hours of\nChrist, and the scenes at the crucifixion. The poor, wasted young man\nask'd me to read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I\nread very slowly, for Oscar was feeble. It pleased him very much, yet\nthe tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd religion. I said,\n\"Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, and yet, may-be, it is the\nsame thing.\" He said, \"It is my chief reliance.\" He talk'd of death, and\nsaid he did not fear it. I said, \"Why, Oscar, don't you think you will\nget well?\" He said, \"I may, but it is not probable.\" He spoke calmly\nof his condition. The wound was very bad, it discharg'd much. Then the\ndiarrhoea had prostrated him, and I felt that he was even then the same\nas dying. He behaved very manly and affectionate. The kiss I gave him\nas I was about leaving he return'd fourfold. He gave me his mother's\naddress, Mrs. Sally D. Wilber, Alleghany pest-office, Cattaraugus\ncounty, N. Y. I had several such interviews with him. He died a few days\nafter the one just described.\n\n\nHOME-MADE MUSIC\n\n_August 8th_.--To-night, as I was trying to keep cool, sitting by a\nwounded soldier in Armory-square, I was attracted by some pleasant\nsinging in an adjoining ward. As my soldier was asleep, I left him, and\nentering the ward where the music was, I walk'd halfway down and took a\nseat by the cot of a young Brooklyn friend, S. R., badly wounded in the\nhand at Chancellorsville, and who has suffer'd much, but at that moment\nin the evening was wide awake and comparatively easy. He had turn'd\nover on his left side to get a better view of the singers, but the\nmosquito-curtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight. I stept\nround and loop'd them all up, so that he had a clear show, and then sat\ndown again by him, and look'd and listen'd. The principal singer was a\nyoung lady-nurse of one of the wards, accompanying on a melodeon, and\njoin'd by the lady-nurses of other wards. They sat there, making a\ncharming group, with their handsome, healthy faces, and standing up\na little behind them were some ten or fifteen of the convalescent\nsoldiers, young men, nurses, &c., with books in their hands, singing.\nOf course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at the\nNew York opera house take a hand in, yet I am not sure but I receiv'd as\nmuch pleasure under the circumstances, sitting there, as I have had from\nthe best Italian compositions, express'd by world-famous performers.\nThe men lying up and down the hospital, in their cots, (some badly\nwounded--some never to rise thence,) the cots themselves, with their\ndrapery of white curtains, and the shadows down the lower and upper\nparts of the ward; then the silence of the men, and the attitudes they\ntook--the whole was a sight to look around upon again and again. And\nthere sweetly rose those voices up to the high, whitewash'd wooden roof,\nand pleasantly the roof sent it all back again. They sang very well,\nmostly quaint old songs and declamatory hymns, to fitting tunes. Here,\nfor instance:\n\n    My days are swiftly gliding by, and I a pilgrim stranger,\n    Would not detain them as they fly, those hours of toil and danger;\n    For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,\n    And just before, the shining shore we may almost discover.\n    We'll gird our loins my brethren dear, our distant home discerning,\n    Our absent Lord has left us word, let every lamp be burning,\n    For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,\n    And just before, the shining shore we may almost discover.\n\n\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\n_August 12th_.--I see the President almost every day, as I happen to\nlive where he passes to or from his lodgings out of town. He never\nsleeps at the White House during the hot season, but has quarters at a\nhealthy location some three miles north of the city, the Soldiers' home,\na United States military establishment. I saw him this morning about 8\n1/2 coming in to business, riding on Vermont avenue, near L street. He\nalways has a company of twenty-five or thirty cavalry, with sabres drawn\nand held upright over their shoulders. They say this guard was against\nhis personal wish, but he let his counselors have their way. The party\nmakes no great show in uniform or horses. Mr. Lincoln on the saddle\ngenerally rides a good-sized, easy-going gray horse, is dress'd in plain\nblack, somewhat rusty and dusty, wears a black stiff hat, and looks\nabout as ordinary in attire, &c., as the commonest man. A lieutenant,\nwith yellow straps, rides at his left, and following behind, two by\ntwo, come the cavalry men, in their yellow-striped jackets. They are\ngenerally going at a slow trot, as that is the pace set them by the one\nthey wait upon. The sabres and accoutrements clank, and the entirely\nunornamental _cortege_ as it trots towards Lafayette square arouses\nno sensation, only some curious stranger stops and gazes. I see very\nplainly ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S dark brown face, with the deep-cut lines, the\neyes, always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression. We\nhave got so that we exchange bows, and very cordial ones. Sometimes\nthe President goes and comes in an open barouche. The cavalry always\naccompany him, with drawn sabres. Often I notice as he goes out\nevenings--and sometimes in the morning, when he returns early--he turns\noff and halts at the large and handsome residence of the Secretary of\nWar, on K street, and holds conference there. If in his barouche, I can\nsee from my window he does not alight, but sits in his vehicle, and Mr.\nStanton comes out to attend him. Sometimes one of his sons, a boy of ten\nor twelve, accompanies him, riding at his right on a pony. Earlier in\nthe summer I occasionally saw the President and his wife, toward the\nlatter part of the afternoon, out in a barouche, on a pleasure ride\nthrough the city. Mrs. Lincoln was dress'd in complete black, with a\nlong crape veil. The equipage is of the plainest kind, only two horses,\nand they nothing extra. They pass'd me once very close, and I saw the\nPresident in the face fully, as they were moving slowly, and his look,\nthough abstracted, happen'd to be directed steadily in my eye. He bow'd\nand smiled, but far beneath his smile I noticed well the expression I\nhave alluded to. None of the artists or pictures has caught the deep,\nthough subtle and indirect expression of this man's face. There is\nsomething else there. One of the great portrait painters of two or three\ncenturies ago is needed.\n\n\nHEATED TERM\n\nThere has lately been much suffering here from heat; we have had it upon\nus now eleven days. I go around with an umbrella and a fan. I saw two\ncases of sun-stroke yesterday, one in Pennsylvania avenue, and another\nin Seventh street. The City railroad company loses some horses every\nday. Yet Washington is having a livelier August, and is probably putting\nin a more energetic and satisfactory summer, than ever before during its\nexistence. There is probably more human electricity, more population to\nmake it, more business, more light-heartedness, than ever before.\nThe armies that swiftly circumambiated from Fredericksburgh--march'd,\nstruggled, fought, had out their mighty clinch and hurl at\nGettysburg--wheel'd, circumambiated again, return'd to their ways,\ntouching us not, either at their going or coming. And Washington feels\nthat she has pass'd the worst; perhaps feels that she is henceforth\nmistress. So here she sits with her surrounding hills spotted with guns,\nand is conscious of a character and identity different from what it\nwas five or six short weeks ago, and very considerably pleasanter and\nprouder.\n\n\nSOLDIERS AND TALKS\n\nSoldiers, soldiers, soldiers, you meet everywhere about the city,\noften superb-looking men, though invalids dress'd in worn uniforms, and\ncarrying canes or crutches. I often have talks with them, occasionally\nquite long and interesting. One, for instance, will have been all\nthrough the peninsula under McClellan--narrates to me the fights, the\nmarches, the strange, quick changes of that eventful campaign, and\ngives glimpses of many things untold in any official reports or books or\njournals. These, indeed, are the things that are genuine and precious.\nThe man was there, has been out two years, has been through a dozen\nfights, the superfluous flesh of talking is long work'd off him, and he\ngives me little but the hard meat and sinew. I find it refreshing, these\nhardy, bright, intuitive, American young men, (experienc'd soldiers with\nall their youth.) The vocal play and significance moves one more than\nbooks. Then there hangs something majestic about a man who has borne his\npart in battles, especially if he is very quiet regarding it when you\ndesire him to unbosom. I am continually lost at the absence of blowing\nand blowers among these old-young American militaires. I have found some\nman or other who has been in every battle since the war began, and have\ntalk'd with them about each one in every part of the United States, and\nmany of the engagements on the rivers and harbors too. I find men\nhere from every State in the Union, without exception. (There are more\nSoutherners, especially border State men, in the Union army than is\ngenerally supposed. [A]) I now doubt whether one can get a fair idea\nof what this war practically is, or what genuine America is, and her\ncharacter, without some such experience as this I am having.\n\n\nDEATH OF A WISCONSIN OFFICER\n\nAnother characteristic scene of that dark and bloody 1863, from notes of\nmy visit to Armory-square hospital, one hot but pleasant summer day. In\nward H we approach the cot of a young lieutenant of one of the Wisconsin\nregiments. Tread the bare board floor lightly here, for the pain and\npanting of death are in this cot. I saw the lieutenant when he was first\nbrought here from Chancellorsville, and have been with him occasionally\nfrom day to day and night to night. He had been getting along pretty\nwell till night before last, when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be\nstopt came upon him, and to-day it still continues at intervals. Notice\nthat water-pail by the side of the bed, with a quantity of blood and\nbloody pieces of muslin, nearly full; that tells the story. The poor\nyoung man is struggling painfully for breath, his great dark eyes with\na glaze already upon them, and the choking faint but audible in his\nthroat. An attendant sits by him, and will not leave him till the last;\nyet little or nothing can be done. He will die here in an hour or two,\nwithout the presence of kith or kin. Meantime the ordinary chat and\nbusiness of[6] the ward a little way off goes on indifferently. Some\nof the inmates are laughing and joking, others are playing checkers or\ncards, others are reading, &c.\n\nI have noticed through most of the hospitals that as long as there\nis any chance for a man, no matter how bad he may be, the surgeon and\nnurses work hard, sometimes with curious tenacity, for his life, doing\neverything, and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor's orders,\nand minister to him every minute night and day. See that screen there.\nAs you advance through the dusk of early candle-light, a nurse will step\nforth on tip-toe, and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any\nnoise, or perhaps to come near at all. Some soldier's life is flickering\nthere, suspended between recovery and death. Perhaps at this moment the\nexhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step might\nshake. You must retire. The neighboring patients must move in their\nstocking feet. I have been several times struck with such mark'd\nefforts--everything bent to save a life from the very grip of the\ndestroyer. But when that grip is once firmly fix'd, leaving no hope or\nchance at all, the surgeon abandons the patient. If it is a case\nwhere stimulus is any relief, the nurse gives milk-punch or brandy, or\nwhatever is wanted, _ad libitum_. There is no fuss made. Not a bit\nof sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death-bed in\nhospital or on the field, but generally impassive indifference. All is\nover, as far as any efforts can avail; it is useless to expend emotions\nor labors. While there is a prospect they strive hard--at least most\nsurgeons do; but death certain and evident, they yield the field.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[6]MR. GARFIELD (_In the House of Representatives, April 15,'79_.) \"Do\ngentlemen know that (leaving out all the border States) there were fifty\nregiments and seven companies of white men in our army fighting for the\nUnion from the States that went into rebellion? Do they know that from\nthe single State of Kentucky more Union soldiers fought under our flag\nthan Napoleon took into the battle of Waterloo? more than Wellington\ntook with all the allied armies against Napoleon? Do they remember that\n186,000 color'd men fought under our flag against the rebellion and for\nthe Union, and that of that number 90,000 were from the States which\nwent into rebellion?\"\n\n\nHOSPITALS ENSEMBLE\n\n_Aug., Sept., and Oct., '63._--I am in the habit of going to all, and\nto Fairfax seminary, Alexandria, and over Long bridge to the great\nConvalescent camp. The journals publish a regular directory of them--a\nlong list. As a specimen of almost any one of the larger of these\nhospitals, fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground,\non which are group'd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks, with,\nperhaps, a dozen or twenty, and sometimes more than that number, small\nbuildings, capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a\nthousand or fifteen hundred persons. Sometimes these wooden barracks or\nwards, each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet\nlong, are rang'd in a straight row, evenly fronting the street; others\nare plann'd so as to form an immense V; and others again are ranged\naround a hollow square. They make altogether a huge cluster, with the\nadditional tents, extra wards for contagious diseases, guard-houses,\nsutler's stores, chaplain's house; in the middle will probably be an\nedifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward\nsurgeons, principal attaches, clerks, &c. The wards are either letter'd\nalphabetically, ward G, ward K, or else numerically, 1, 2, 3, &c. Each\nhas its ward surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course, there is, in the\naggregate, quite a muster of employes, and over all the surgeon in\ncharge. Here in Washington, when these army hospitals are all fill'd,\n(as they have been already several times,) they contain a population\nmore numerous in itself than the whole of the Washington of ten or\nfifteen years ago. Within sight of the capitol, as I write, are some\nthirty or forty such collections, at times holding from fifty to seventy\nthousand men. Looking from any eminence and studying the topography in\nmy rambles, I use them as landmarks. Through the rich August verdure\nof the trees, see that white group of buildings off yonder in the\noutskirts; then another cluster half a mile to the left of the first;\nthen another a mile to the right, and another a mile beyond, and still\nanother between us and the first. Indeed, we can hardly look in any\ndirection but these clusters are dotting the landscape and environs.\nThat little town, as you might suppose it, off there on the brow of a\nhill, is indeed a town, but of wounds, sickness, and death. It is Finley\nhospital, northeast of the city, on Kendall green, as it used to be\ncall'd. That other is Campbell hospital. Both are large establishments.\nI have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twenty-five\nhundred inmates. Then there is Carver hospital, larger still, a wall'd\nand military city regularly laid out, and guarded by squads of sentries.\nAgain, off east, Lincoln hospital, a still larger one; and half a mile\nfurther Emory hospital. Still sweeping the eye around down the river\ntoward Alexandria, we see, to the right, the locality where the\nConvalescent camp stands, with its five, eight, or sometimes ten\nthousand inmates. Even all these are but a portion. The Harewood, Mount\nPleasant, Armory-square, Judiciary hospitals, are some of the rest, and\nall large collections.\n\n\nA SILENT NIGHT RAMBLE\n\n_October 20th_.--To-night, after leaving the hospital at 10 o'clock, (I\nhad been on self-imposed duty some five hours, pretty closely confined,)\nI wander'd a long time around Washington. The night was sweet, very\nclear, sufficiently cool, a voluptuous halfmoon, slightly golden, the\nspace near it of a transparent blue-gray tinge. I walk'd up Pennsylvania\navenue, and then to Seventh street, and a long while around the\nPatent-office. Somehow it look'd rebukefully strong, majestic, there in\nthe delicate moonlight. The sky, the planets, the constellations all\nso bright, so calm, so expressively silent, so soothing, after those\nhospital scenes. I wander'd to and fro till the moist moon set, long\nafter midnight.\n\n\nSPIRITUAL CHARACTERS AMONG THE SOLDIERS\n\nEvery now and then, in hospital or camp, there are beings I\nmeet--specimens of unworldliness, disinterestedness, and animal purity\nand heroism--perhaps some unconscious Indianian, or from Ohio or\nTennessee--on whose birth the calmness of heaven seems to have\ndescended, and whose gradual growing up, whatever the circumstances of\nwork-life or change, or hardship, or small or no education that attended\nit, the power of a strange spiritual sweetness, fibre and inward health,\nhave also attended. Something veil'd and abstracted is often a part of\nthe manners of these beings. I have met them, I say, not seldom in the\narmy, in camp, and in the hospitals. The Western regiments contain many\nof them. They are often young men, obeying the events and occasions\nabout them, marching, soldiering, righting, foraging, cooking, working\non farms or at some trade before the war--unaware of their own nature,\n(as to that, who is aware of his own nature?) their companions only\nunderstanding that they are different from the rest, more silent,\n\"something odd about them,\" and apt to go off and meditate and muse in\nsolitude.\n\n\nCATTLE DROVES ABOUT WASHINGTON\n\nAmong other sights are immense droves of cattle with their drivers,\npassing through the streets of the city. Some of the men have a way\nof leading the cattle by a peculiar call, a wild, pensive hoot, quite\nmusical, prolong'd, indescribable, sounding something between the cooing\nof a pigeon and the hoot of an owl. I like to stand and look at the\nsight of one of these immense droves--a little way off--(as the dust\nis great.) There are always men on horseback, cracking their whips\nand shouting--the cattle low--some obstinate ox or steer attempts to\nescape--then a lively scene--the mounted men, always excellent riders\nand on good horses, dash after the recusant, and wheel and turn--a\ndozen mounted drovers, their great slouch'd, broad-brim'd hats, very\npicturesque--another dozen on foot--everybody cover'd with dust--long\ngoads in their hands--an immense drove of perhaps 1000 cattle--the\nshouting, hooting, movement, &c.\n\n\nHOSPITAL PERPLEXITY\n\nTo add to other troubles, amid the confusion of this great army of sick,\nit is almost impossible for a stranger to find any friend or relative,\nunless he has the patient's specific address to start upon. Besides the\ndirectory printed in the newspapers here, there are one or two general\ndirectories of the hospitals kept at provost's head-quarters, but they\nare nothing like complete; they are never up to date, and, as things\nare, with the daily streams of coming and going and changing, cannot\nbe. I have known cases, for instance such as a farmer coming here from\nnorthern New York to find a wounded brother, faithfully hunting round\nfor a week, and then compell'd to leave and go home without getting any\ntrace of him. When he got home he found a letter from the brother giving\nthe right address.\n\n\nDOWN AT THE FRONT\n\nCULPEPPER, VA., _Feb. '64._--Here I am FRONT pretty well down toward the\nextreme front. Three or four days ago General S., who is now in chief\ncommand, (I believe Meade is absent, sick,) moved a strong force\nsouthward from camp as if intending business. They went to the Rapidan;\nthere has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting, but\nnothing of consequence. The telegraphic accounts given Monday morning\nlast, make entirely too much of it, I should say. What General S.\nintended we here know not, but we trust in that competent commander. We\nwere somewhat excited, (but not so very much either,) on Sunday, during\nthe day and night, as orders were sent out to pack up and harness, and\nbe ready to evacuate, to fall back towards Washington. But I was very\nsleepy and went to bed. Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the\nnight, I went forth and found it was from the men above mention'd, who\nwere returning. I talk'd with some of the men; as usual I found them\nfull of gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs of\nthe most excellent good manliness of the world. It was a curious\nsight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night. I stood\nunobserv'd in the darkness and watch'd them long. The mud was very\ndeep. The men had their usual burdens, overcoats, knapsacks, guns and\nblankets. Along and along they filed by me, with often a laugh, a song,\na cheerful word, but never once a murmur. It may have been odd, but I\nnever before so realized the majesty and reality of the American people\n_en masse_. It fell upon me like a great awe. The strong ranks moved\nneither fast nor slow. They had march'd seven or eight miles already\nthrough the slipping unctuous mud. The brave First corps stopt here.\nThe equally brave Third corps moved on to Brandy station. The famous\nBrooklyn 14th are here, guarding the town. You see their red legs\nactively moving everywhere. Then they have a theatre of their own here.\nThey give musical performances, nearly everything done capitally. Of\ncourse the audience is a jam. It is good sport to attend one of these\nentertainments of the 14th. I like to look around at the soldiers, and\nthe general collection in front of the curtain, more than the scene on\nthe stage.\n\n\nPAYING THE BOUNTIES\n\nOne of the things to note here now is the arrival of the paymaster with\nhis strong box, and the payment of bounties to veterans re-enlisting.\nMajor H. is here to-day, with a small mountain of greenbacks, rejoicing\nthe hearts of the 2d division of the First corps. In the midst of a\nrickety shanty, behind a little table, sit the major and clerk Eldridge,\nwith the rolls before them, and much moneys. A re-enlisted man gets in\ncash about $200 down, (and heavy instalments following, as the pay-days\narrive, one after another.) The show of the men crowding around is quite\nexhilarating; I like to stand and look. They feel elated, their pockets\nfull, and the ensuing furlough, the visit home. It is a scene of\nsparkling eyes and flush'd cheeks. The soldier has many gloomy and harsh\nexperiences, and this makes up for some of them. Major H. is order'd to\npay first all the re-enlisted men of the First corps their bounties and\nback pay, and then the rest. You hear the peculiar sound of the rustling\nof the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour, through the nimble fingers\nof the major and my friend clerk E.\n\n\nRUMORS, CHANGES, ETC.\n\nAbout the excitement of Sunday, and the orders to be ready to start,\nI have heard since that the said orders came from some cautious minor\ncommander, and that the high principalities knew not and thought not of\nany such move; which is likely. The rumor and fear here intimated a long\ncircuit by Lee, and flank attack on our right. But I cast my eyes at the\nmud, which was then at its deepest and palmiest condition, and retired\ncomposedly to rest. Still it is about time for Culpepper to have a\nchange. Authorities have chased each other here like clouds in a stormy\nsky. Before the first Bull Run this was the rendezvous and camp of\ninstruction of the secession troops. I am stopping at the house of a\nlady who has witness'd all the eventful changes of the war, along this\nroute of contending armies. She is a widow, with a family of young\nchildren, and lives here with her sister in a large handsome house. A\nnumber of army officers board with them.\n\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nDilapidated, fenceless, and trodden with war as Virginia is, wherever\nI move across her surface, I find myself rous'd to surprise and\nadmiration. What capacity for products, improvements, human life,\nnourishment and expansion. Everywhere that I have been in the Old\nDominion, (the subtle mockery of that title now!) such thoughts have\nfill'd me. The soil is yet far above the average of any of the northern\nStates. And how full of breadth the scenery, everywhere distant\nmountains, everywhere convenient rivers. Even yet prodigal in forest\nwoods, and surely eligible for all the fruits, orchards, and flowers.\nThe skies and atmosphere most luscious, as I feel certain, from more\nthan a year's residence in the State, and movements hither and yon. I\nshould say very healthy, as a general thing. Then a rich and elastic\nquality, by night and by day. The sun rejoices in his strength, dazzling\nand burning, and yet, to me, never unpleasantly weakening. It is not the\npanting tropical heat, but invigorates. The north tempers it. The nights\nare often unsurpassable. Last evening (Feb. 8,) I saw the first of the\nnew moon, the outlined old moon clear along with it; the sky and air\nso clear, such transparent hues of color, it seem'd to me I had never\nreally seen the new moon before. It was the thinnest cut crescent\npossible. It hung delicate just above the sulky shadow of the Blue\nmountains. Ah, if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for this\nunhappy State.\n\n\nSUMMER OF 1864\n\nI am back again in Washington, on my regular daily and nightly rounds.\nOf course there are many specialties. Dotting a ward here and there are\nalways cases of poor fellows, long-suffering under obstinate wounds,\nor weak and dishearten'd from typhoid fever, or the like; mark'd cases,\nneeding special and sympathetic nourishment. These I sit down and either\ntalk to, or silently cheer them up. They always like it hugely, (and so\ndo I.) Each case has its peculiarities, and needs some new adaptation. I\nhave learnt to thus conform--learnt a good deal of hospital wisdom.\nSome of the poor young chaps, away from home for the first time in their\nlives, hunger and thirst for affection; this is sometimes the only thing\nthat will reach their condition. The men like to have a pencil, and\nsomething to write in. I have given them cheap pocket-diaries, and\nalmanacs for 1864, interleav'd with blank paper. For reading I generally\nhave some old pictorial magazines or story papers--they are always\nacceptable. Also the morning or evening papers of the day. The best\nbooks I do not give, but lend to read through the wards, and then take\nthem to others, and so on; they are very punctual about returning the\nbooks. In these wards, or on the field, as I thus continue to go round,\nI have come to adapt myself to each emergency, after its kind or call,\nhowever trivial, however solemn, every one justified and made real\nunder its circumstances--not only visits and cheering talk and little\ngifts--not only washing and dressing wounds, (I have some cases where\nthe patient is unwilling any one should do this but me)--but passages\nfrom the Bible, expounding them, prayer at the bedside, explanations of\ndoctrine, &c. (I think I see my friends smiling at this confession, but\nI was never more in earnest in my life.) In camp and everywhere, I was\nin the habit of reading or giving recitations to the men. They were very\nfond of it, and liked declamatory poetical pieces. We would gather in\na large group by ourselves, after supper, and spend the time in such\nreadings, or in talking, and occasionally by an amusing game called the\ngame of twenty questions.\n\n\nA NEW ARMY ORGANIZATION FIT FOR AMERICA\n\nIt is plain to me out of the events of the war, north and south, and out\nof all considerations, that the current military theory, practice, rules\nand organization, (adopted from Europe from the feudal institutes, with,\nof course, the \"modern improvements,\" largely from the French,) though\ntacitly follow'd, and believ'd in by the officers generally, are not at\nall consonant with the United States, nor our people, nor our days. What\nit will be I know not--but I know that as entire an abnegation of the\npresent military system, and the naval too, and a building up from\nradically different root-bases and centres appropriate to us, must\neventually result, as that our political system has resulted and become\nestablish'd, different from feudal Europe, and built up on itself from\noriginal, perennial, democratic premises. We have undoubtedly in the\nUnited States the greatest military power--an exhaustless, intelligent,\nbrave and reliable rank and file--in the world, any land, perhaps all\nlands. The problem is to organize this in the manner fully appropriate\nto it, to the principles of the republic, and to get the best service\nout of it. In the present struggle, as already seen and review'd,\nprobably three-fourths of the losses, men, lives, &c., have been sheer\nsuperfluity, extravagance, waste.\n\n\nDEATH OF A HERO\n\nI wonder if I could ever convey to another--to you, for instance, reader\ndear--the tender and terrible realities of such cases, (many, many\nhappen'd,) as the one I am now going to mention. Stewart C. Glover,\ncompany E, 5th Wisconsin--was wounded May 5, in one of those fierce\ntussles of the Wilderness-died May 21--aged about 20. He was a small\nand beardless young man--a splendid soldier--in fact almost an ideal\nAmerican, of his age. He had serv'd nearly three years, and would have\nbeen entitled to his discharge in a few days. He was in Hancock's corps.\nThe fighting had about ceas'd for the day, and the general commanding\nthe brigade rode by and call'd for volunteers to bring in the wounded.\nGlover responded among the first--went out gayly--but while in the act\nof bearing in a wounded sergeant to our lines, was shot in the knee by\na rebel sharpshooter; consequence, amputation and death. He had resided\nwith his father, John Glover, an aged and feeble man, in Batavia,\nGenesee county, N. Y., but was at school in Wisconsin, after the war\nbroke out, and there enlisted--soon took to soldier-life, liked it,\nwas very manly, was belov'd by officers and comrades. He kept a little\ndiary, like so many of the soldiers. On the day of his death he wrote\nthe following in it, _to-day the doctor says I must die--all is over\nwith me--ah, so young to die_. On another blank leaf he pencill'd to his\nbrother, _dear brother Thomas, I have been brave but wicked--pray for\nme._\n\n\nHOSPITAL SCENES--INCIDENTS\n\nIt is Sunday afternoon, middle of summer, hot and oppressive, and very\nsilent through the ward. I am taking care of a critical case, now lying\nin a half lethargy. Near where I sit is a suffering rebel, from the\n8th Louisiana; his name is Irving. He has been here a long time, badly\nwounded, and lately had his leg amputated; it is not doing very well.\nRight opposite me is a sick soldier-boy, laid down with his clothes on,\nsleeping, looking much wasted, his pallid face on his arm. I see by the\nyellow trimming on his jacket that he is a cavalry boy. I step softly\nover and find by his card that he is named William Cone, of the 1st\nMaine cavalry, and his folks live in Skowhegan.\n\n_Ice Cream Treat_.--One hot day toward the middle of June, I gave the\ninmates of Carver hospital a general ice cream treat, purchasing a large\nquantity, and, under convoy of the doctor or head nurse, going\naround personally through the wards to see to its distribution. _An\nIncident_.--In one of the rights before Atlanta, a rebel soldier, of\nlarge size, evidently a young man, was mortally wounded top of the head,\nso that the brains partially exuded. He lived three days, lying on\nhis back on the spot where he first dropt. He dug with his heel in the\nground during that time a hole big enough to put in a couple of\nordinary knapsacks. He just lay there in the open air, and with little\nintermission kept his heel going night and day. Some of our soldiers\nthen moved him to a house, but he died in a few minutes.\n\n_Another_.--After the battles at Columbia, Tennessee, where we repuls'd\nabout a score of vehement rebel charges, they left a great many wounded\non the ground, mostly within our range. Whenever any of these wounded\nattempted to move away by any means, generally by crawling off, our men\nwithout exception brought them down by a bullet. They let none crawl\naway, no matter what his condition.\n\n\nA YANKEE SOLDIER\n\nAs I turn'd off the Avenue one cool October evening into Thirteenth\nstreet, a soldier with knapsack and overcoat stood at the corner\ninquiring his way. I found he wanted to go part of the road in my\ndirection, so we walk'd on together. We soon fell into conversation. He\nwas small and not very young, and a tough little fellow, as I judged in\nthe evening light, catching glimpses by the lamps we pass'd. His answers\nwere short, but clear. His name was Charles Carroll; he belong'd to\none of the Massachusetts regiments, and was born in or near Lynn. His\nparents were living, but were very old. There were four sons, and all\nhad enlisted. Two had died of starvation and misery in the prison at\nAndersonville, and one had been kill'd in the west. He only was left.\nHe was now going home, and by the way he talk'd I inferr'd that his time\nwas nearly out. He made great calculations on being with his parents to\ncomfort them the rest of their days.\n\n\nUNION PRISONERS SOUTH\n\nMichael Stansbury, 48 years of age, a seafaring man, a southerner by\nbirth and raising, formerly captain of U. S. light ship Long Shoal,\nstation'd at Long Shoal point, Pamlico sound--though a southerner, a\nfirm Union man--was captur'd Feb. 17, 1863, and has been nearly two\nyears in the Confederate prisons; was at one time order'd releas'd by\nGovernor Vance, but a rebel officer re-arrested him; then sent on to\nRichmond for exchange--but instead of being exchanged was sent down\n(as a southern citizen, not a soldier,) to Salisbury, N. C., where he\nremain'd until lately, when he escap'd among the exchang'd by assuming\nthe name of a dead soldier, and coming up via Wilmington with the rest.\nWas about sixteen months in Salisbury.\n\nSubsequent to October, '64, there were about 11,000 Union prisoners in\nthe stockade; about 100 of them southern unionists, 200 U. S. deserters.\nDuring the past winter 1500 of the prisoners, to save their lives,\njoin'd the confederacy, on condition of being assign'd merely to guard\nduty. Out of the 11,000 not more than 2500 came out; 500 of these were\npitiable, helpless wretches--the rest were in a condition to travel.\nThere were often 60 dead bodies to be buried in the morning; the daily\naverage would be about 40. The regular food was a meal of corn, the cob\nand husk ground together, and sometimes once a week a ration of sorghum\nmolasses. A diminutive ration of meat might possibly come once a month,\nnot oftener. In the stockade, containing the 11,000 men, there was a\npartial show of tents, not enough for 2000. A large proportion of the\nmen lived in holes in the ground, in the utmost wretchedness. Some froze\nto death, others had their hands and feet frozen. The rebel guards would\noccasionally, and on the least pretence, fire into the prison from mere\ndemonism and wantonness. All the horrors that can be named, starvation,\nlassitude, filth, vermin, despair, swift loss of self-respect, idiocy,\ninsanity, and frequent murder, were there. Stansbury has a wife and\nchild living in Newbern--has written to them from here--is in the U. S.\nlight-house employ still--(had been home to Newbern to see his family,\nand on his return to the ship was captured in his boat.) Has seen men\nbrought there to Salisbury as hearty as you ever see in your life--in\na few weeks completely dead gone, much of it from thinking on their\ncondition--hope all gone. Has himself a hard, sad, strangely deaden'd\nkind of look, as of one chill' d for years in the cold and dark, where\nhis good manly nature had no room to exercise itself.\n\n\nDESERTERS\n\n_Oct. 24_.--Saw a large squad of our own deserters (over 300) surrounded\nwith a cordon of arm'd guards, marching along Pennsylvania avenue. The\nmost motley collection I ever saw, all sorts of rig, all sorts of hats\nand caps, many fine-looking young fellows, some of them shame-faced,\nsome sickly, most of them dirty, shirts very dirty and long worn, &c.\nThey tramp'd along without order, a huge huddling mass, not in ranks. I\nsaw some of the spectators laughing, but I felt like anything else but\nlaughing. These deserters are far more numerous than would be thought.\nAlmost every day I see squads of them, sometimes two or three at a time,\nwith a small guard; sometimes ten or twelve, under a larger one. (I\nhear that desertions from the army now in the field have often averaged\n10,000 a month. One of the commonest sights in Washington is a squad of\ndeserters.)\n\n\nA GLIMPSE OF WAR'S HELL-SCENES\n\nIn one of the late movements of our troops in the valley, (near\nUpperville, I think,) a strong force of Moseby's mounted guerillas\nattack'd a train of wounded, and the guard of cavalry convoying them.\nThe ambulances contain'd about 60 wounded, quite a number of them\nofficers of rank. The rebels were in strength, and the capture of\nthe train and its partial guard after a short snap was effectually\naccomplish'd. No sooner had our men surrender'd, the rebels instantly\ncommenced robbing the train and murdering their prisoners, even the\nwounded. Here is the scene, or a sample of it, ten minutes after.\nAmong the wounded officers in the ambulances were one, a lieutenant of\nregulars, and another of higher rank. These two were dragg'd out on\nthe ground on their backs, and were now surrounded by the guerillas,\na demoniac crowd, each member of which was stabbing them in different\nparts of their bodies. One of the officers had his feet pinn'd firmly\nto the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into the ground.\nThese two officers, as afterwards found on examination, had receiv'd\nabout twenty such thrusts, some of them through the mouth, face, &c. The\nwounded had all been dragg'd (to give a better chance also for plunder,)\nout of their wagons; some had been effectually dispatch'd, and their\nbodies were lying there lifeless and bloody. Others, not yet dead,\nbut horribly mutilated, were moaning or groaning. Of our men who\nsurrender'd, most had been thus maim'd or slaughter'd.\n\nAt this instant a force of our cavalry, who had been following the\ntrain at some interval, charged suddenly upon the secesh captors, who\nproceeded at once to make the best escape they could. Most of them got\naway, but we gobbled two officers and seventeen men, in the very acts\njust described. The sight was one which admitted of little discussion,\nas may be imagined. The seventeen captur'd men and two officers were put\nunder guard for the night, but it was decided there and then that they\nshould die. The next morning the two officers were taken in the\ntown, separate places, put in the centre of the street, and shot. The\nseventeen men were taken to an open ground, a little one side. They\nwere placed in a hollow square, half-encompass'd by two of our cavalry\nregiments, one of which regiments had three days before found the bloody\ncorpses of three of their men hamstrung and hung up by the heels to\nlimbs of trees by Moseby's guerillas, and the other had not long before\nhad twelve men, after surrendering, shot and then hung by the neck to\nlimbs of trees, and jeering inscriptions pinn'd to the breast of one of\nthe corpses, who had been a sergeant. Those three, and those twelve, had\nbeen found, I say, by these environing regiments. Now, with revolvers,\nthey form'd the grim cordon of the seventeen prisoners. The latter were\nplaced in the midst of the hollow square, unfasten'd, and the ironical\nremark made to them that they were now to be given \"a chance for\nthemselves.\" A few ran for it. But what use? From every side the deadly\npills came. In a few minutes the seventeen corpses strew'd the hollow\nsquare. I was curious to know whether some of the Union soldiers, some\nfew, (some one or two at least of the youngsters,) did not abstain from\nshooting on the helpless men. Not one. There was no exultation, very\nlittle said, almost nothing, yet every man there contributed his shot.\n\nMultiply the above by scores, aye hundreds--verify it in all the forms\nthat different circumstances, individuals, places, could afford--light\nit with every lurid passion, the wolf's, the lion's lapping thirst for\nblood--the passionate, boiling volcanoes of human revenge for comrades,\nbrothers slain--with the light of burning farms, and heaps of smutting,\nsmouldering black embers--and in the human heart everywhere black, worse\nembers--and you have an inkling of this war.\n\n\nGIFTS--MONEY--DISCRIMINATION\n\nAs a very large proportion of the wounded came up from the front without\na cent of money in their pockets, I soon discover'd that it was about\nthe best thing I could do to raise their spirits, and show them that\nsomebody cared for them, and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly\ninterest in them, to give them small sums in such cases, using tact and\ndiscretion about it. I am regularly supplied with funds for this purpose\nby good women and men in Boston, Salem, Providence, Brooklyn, and\nNew York. I provide myself with a quantity of bright new ten-cent and\nfive-cent bills, and, when I think it incumbent, I give 25 or 30\ncents, or perhaps 50 cents, and occasionally a still larger sum to some\nparticular case. As I have started this subject, I take opportunity to\nventilate the financial question. My supplies, altogether voluntary,\nmostly confidential, often seeming quite Providential, were numerous\nand varied. For instance, there were two distant and wealthy ladies,\nsisters, who sent regularly, for two years, quite heavy sums, enjoining\nthat their names should be kept secret. The same delicacy was indeed a\nfrequent condition. From several I had _carte blanche_. Many were entire\nstrangers. From these sources, during from two to three years, in the\nmanner described, in the hospitals, I bestowed, as almoner for others,\nmany, many thousands of dollars. I learn'd one thing conclusively--that\nbeneath all the ostensible greed and heartlessness of our times there\nis no end to the generous benevolence of men and women in the United\nStates, when once sure of their object. Another thing became clear to\nme--while _cash_ is not amiss to bring up the rear, tact and magnetic\nsympathy and unction are, and ever will be, sovereign still.\n\n\nITEMS FROM MY NOTE BOOKS\n\nSome of the half-eras'd, and not over-legible when made, memoranda of\nthings wanted by one patient or another, will convey quite a fair idea.\nD. S. G., bed 52, wants a good book; has a sore, weak throat; would like\nsome horehound candy; is from New Jersey, 28th regiment. C. H. L., 145th\nPennsylvania, lies in bed 6, with jaundice and erysipelas; also wounded;\nstomach easily nauseated; bring him some oranges, also a little tart\njelly; hearty, full-blooded young fellow--(he got better in a few days,\nand is now home on a furlough.) J. H. G., bed 24, wants an undershirt,\ndrawers, and socks; has not had a change for quite a while; is evidently\na neat, clean boy from New England--(I supplied him; also with a comb,\ntooth-brush, and some soap and towels; I noticed afterward he was the\ncleanest of the whole ward.) Mrs. G., lady-nurse, ward F, wants a bottle\nof brandy--has two patients imperatively requiring stimulus--low with\nwounds and exhaustion. (I supplied her with a bottle of first-rate\nbrandy from the Christian commission rooms.)\n\n\nA CASE FROM SECOND BULL RUN\n\nWell, Poor John Mahay is dead. He died yesterday. His was a painful and\nlong-lingering case (see p. 24 _ante_.) I have been with him at times\nfor the past fifteen months. He belonged to company A, 101st New York,\nand was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second Bull Run,\nAugust, '62. One scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of\nnearly two years. The bladder had been perforated by a bullet going\nentirely through him. Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by\nhis bedside, ward E, Armory square. The water ran out of his eyes from\nthe intense pain, and the muscles of his face were distorted, but he\nutter'd nothing except a low groan now and then. Hot moist cloths were\napplied, and reliev'd him somewhat. Poor Mahay, a mere boy in age, but\nold in misfortune. He never knew the love of parents, was placed in\ninfancy in one of the New York charitable institutions, and subsequently\nbound out to a tyrannical master in Sullivan county, (the scars of whose\ncowhide and club remain'd yet on his back.) His wound here was a most\ndisagreeable one, for he was a gentle, cleanly, and affectionate boy.\nHe found friends in his hospital life, and, indeed, was a universal\nfavorite. He had quite a funeral ceremony.\n\n\nARMY SURGEONS--AID DEFICIENCIES\n\nI must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal, manliness, and\nprofessional spirit and capacity, generally prevailing among the\nsurgeons, many of them young men, in the hospitals and the army. I will\nnot say much about the exceptions, for they are few; (but I have met\nsome of those few, and very incompetent and airish they were.) I never\nceas'd to find the best men, and the hardest and most disinterested\nworkers, among the surgeons in the hospitals. They are full of genius,\ntoo. I have seen many hundreds of them and this is my testimony. There\nare, however, serious deficiencies, wastes, sad want of system, in the\ncommissions, contributions, and in all the voluntary, and a great part\nof the governmental nursing, edibles, medicines, stores, &c. (I do not\nsay surgical attendance, because the surgeons cannot do more than human\nendurance permits.) Whatever puffing accounts there may be in the papers\nof the North, this is the actual fact. No thorough previous preparation,\nno system, no foresight, no genius. Always plenty of stores, no doubt,\nbut never where they are needed, and never the proper application.\nOf all harrowing experiences, none is greater than that of the days\nfollowing a heavy battle. Scores, hundreds of the noblest men on earth,\nuncomplaining, lie helpless, mangled, faint, alone, and so bleed to\ndeath, or die from exhaustion, either actually untouch'd at all, or\nmerely the laying of them down and leaving them, when there ought to be\nmeans provided to save them.\n\n\nTHE BLUE EVERYWHERE\n\nThis city, its suburbs, the capitol, the front of the White House, the\nplaces of amusement, the Avenue, and all the main streets, swarm with\nsoldiers this winter, more than ever before. Some are out from the\nhospitals, some from the neighboring camps, &c. One source or another,\nthey pour plenteously, and make, I should say, the mark'd feature in the\nhuman movement and costume-appearance of our national city. Their blue\npants and overcoats are everywhere. The clump of crutches is heard up\nthe stairs of the paymasters' offices, and there are characteristic\ngroups around the doors of the same, often waiting long and wearily\nin the cold. Toward the latter part of the afternoon, you see the\nfurlough'd men, sometimes singly, sometimes in small squads, making\ntheir way to the Baltimore depot. At all times, except early in the\nmorning, the patrol detachments are moving around, especially during the\nearlier hours of evening, examining passes, and arresting all soldiers\nwithout them. They do not question the one-legged, or men badly disabled\nor main'd, but all others are stopt. They also go around evenings\nthrough the auditoriums of the theatres, and make officers and all show\ntheir passes, or other authority, for being there.\n\n\nA MODEL HOSPITAL\n\n_Sunday, January 29th, 1865_.--Have been in Armory-square this\nafternoon. The wards are very comfortable, new floors and plaster walls,\nand models of neatness. I am not sure but this is a model hospital after\nall, in important respects. I found several sad cases of old lingering\nwounds. One Delaware soldier, William H. Millis, from Bridgeville, whom\nI had been with after the battles of the Wilderness, last May, where he\nreceiv'd a very bad wound in the chest, with another in the left arm,\nand whose case was serious (pneumonia had set in) all last June and\nJuly, I now find well enough to do light duty. For three weeks at the\ntime mention'd he just hovered between life and death.\n\n\nBOYS IN THE ARMY\n\nAs I walk'd home about sunset, I saw in Fourteenth street a very young\nsoldier, thinly clad, standing near the house I was about to enter. I\nstopt a moment in front of the door and call'd him to me. I knew that an\nold Tennessee regiment, and also an Indiana regiment, were temporarily\nstopping in new barracks, near Fourteenth street. This boy I found\nbelonged to the Tennessee regiment. But I could hardly believe he\ncarried a musket. He was but 15 years old, yet had been twelve months a\nsoldier, and had borne his part in several battles, even historic\nones. I ask'd him if he did not suffer from the cold, and if he had\nno overcoat. No, he did not suffer from cold, and had no overcoat, but\ncould draw one whenever he wish'd. His father was dead, and his mother\nliving in some part of East Tennessee; all the men were from that\npart of the country. The next forenoon I saw the Tennessee and Indiana\nregiments marching down the Avenue. My boy was with the former, stepping\nalong with the rest. There were many other boys no older. I stood and\nwatch'd them as they tramp'd along with slow, strong, heavy, regular\nsteps. There did not appear to be a man over 30 years of age, and a\nlarge proportion were from 15 to perhaps 22 or 23. They had all the look\nof veterans, worn, stain'd, impassive, and a certain unbent, lounging\ngait, carrying in addition to their regular arms and knapsacks,\nfrequently a frying-pan, broom, &c. They were all of pleasant\nphysiognomy; no refinement, nor blanch'd with intellect, but as my eye\npick'd them, moving along, rank by rank, there did not seem to be a\nsingle repulsive, brutal or markedly stupid face among them.\n\n\nBURIAL OF A LADY NURSE\n\nHere is an incident just occurr'd in one of the hospitals. A lady named\nMiss or Mrs. Billings, who has long been a practical friend of soldiers,\nand nurse in the army, and had become attached to it in a way that no\none can realize but him or her who has had experience, was taken sick,\nearly this winter, linger'd some time, and finally died in the hospital.\nIt was her request that she should be buried among the soldiers, and\nafter the military method. This request was fully carried out. Her\ncoffin was carried to the grave by soldiers, with the usual escort,\nburied, and a salute fired over the grave. This was at Annapolis a few\ndays since.\n\n\nFEMALE NURSES FOR SOLDIERS\n\nThere are many women in one position or another, among the hospitals,\nmostly as nurses here in Washington, and among the military stations;\nquite a number of them young ladies acting as volunteers. They are a\nhelp in certain ways, and deserve to be mention'd with respect. Then\nit remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies, under the\nirresistible conventions of society, answer the practical requirements\nof nurses for soldiers. Middle-aged or healthy and good condition'd\nelderly women, mothers of children, are always best. Many of the wounded\nmust be handled. A hundred things which cannot be gainsay'd, must occur\nand must be done. The presence of a good middle-aged or elderly woman,\nthe magnetic touch of hands, the expressive features of the mother, the\nsilent soothing of her presence, her words, her knowledge and privileges\narrived at only through having had children, are precious and final\nqualifications. It is a natural faculty that is required; it is not\nmerely having a genteel young woman at a table in a ward. One of the\nfinest nurses I met was a red-faced illiterate old Irish woman; I have\nseen her take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms.\nThere are plenty of excellent clean old black women that would make\ntip-top nurses.\n\n\nSOUTHERN ESCAPEES\n\n_Feb. 23, '65_.--I saw a large procession of young men from the rebel\narmy, (deserters they are call'd, but the usual meaning of the word does\nnot apply to them,) passing the Avenue to-day. There were nearly 200,\ncome up yesterday by boat from James river. I stood and watch'd them\nas they shuffled along, in a slow, tired, worn sort of way; a large\nproportion of light-hair'd, blonde, light gray-eyed young men among\nthem. Their costumes had a dirt-stain'd uniformity; most had been\noriginally gray; some had articles of our uniform, pants on one, vest\nor coat on another; I think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina\nboys. They excited little or no attention. As I stood quite close to\nthem, several good looking enough youths, (but O what a tale of misery\ntheir appearance told,) nodded or just spoke to me, without doubt\ndivining pity and fatherliness out of my face, for my heart was full\nenough of it. Several of the couples trudg'd along with their arms about\neach other, some probably brothers, as if they were afraid they might\nsomehow get separated. They nearly all look'd what one might call\nsimple, yet intelligent, too. Some had pieces of old carpet, some\nblankets, and others old bags around their shoulders. Some of them here\nand there had fine faces, still it was a procession of misery. The two\nhundred had with them about half a dozen arm'd guards. Along this week\nI saw some such procession, more or less in numbers, every day, as they\nwere brought up by the boat. The government does what it can for them,\nand sends them north and west.\n\n_Feb. 27_.--Some three or four hundred more escapees from the\nconfederate army came up on the boat. As the day has been very pleasant\nindeed, (after a long spell of bad weather,) I have been wandering\naround a good deal, without any other object than to be out-doors and\nenjoy it; have met these escaped men in all directions. Their apparel is\nthe same ragged, long-worn motley as before described. I talk'd with a\nnumber of the men. Some are quite bright and stylish, for all their poor\nclothes--walking with an air, wearing their old head-coverings on one\nside, quite saucily. I find the old, unquestionable proofs, as all\nalong the past four years, of the unscrupulous tyranny exercised by the\nsecession government in conscripting the common people by absolute force\neverywhere, and paying no attention whatever to the men's time being\nup--keeping them in military service just the same. One gigantic young\nfellow, a Georgian, at least six feet three inches high, broad-sized in\nproportion, attired in the dirtiest, drab, well smear'd rags, tied\nwith strings, his trousers at the knees all strips and streamers, was\ncomplacently standing eating some bread and meat. He appear'd contented\nenough. Then a few minutes after I saw him slowly walking along. It was\nplain he did not take anything to heart.\n\n_Feb. 28._--As I pass'd the military headquarters of the city, not far\nfrom the President's house, I stopt to interview some of the crowd of\nescapees who were lounging there. In appearance they were the same as\npreviously mention'd. Two of them, one about 17, and the other perhaps\n25 or '6, I talk'd with some time. They were from North Carolina, born\nand rais'd there, and had folks there. The elder had been in the rebel\nservice four years. He was first conscripted for two years. He was then\nkept arbitrarily in the ranks. This is the case with a large proportion\nof the secession army. There was nothing downcast in these young\nmen's manners; the younger had been soldiering about a year; he was\nconscripted; there were six brothers (all the boys of the family) in\nthe army, part of them as conscripts, part as volunteers; three had been\nkill'd; one had escaped about four months ago, and now this one had got\naway; he was a pleasant and well-talking lad, with the peculiar North\nCarolina idiom (not at all disagreeable to my ears.) He and the elder\none were of the same company, and escaped together--and wish'd to remain\ntogether. They thought of getting transportation away to Missouri, and\nworking there; but were not sure it was judicious. I advised them rather\nto go to some of the directly northern States, and get farm work for the\npresent. The younger had made six dollars on the boat, with some tobacco\nhe brought; he had three and a half left. The elder had nothing; I\ngave him a trifle. Soon after, met John Wormley, 9th Alabama, a West\nTennessee rais' d boy, parents both dead--had the look of one for a long\ntime on short allowance--said very little--chew'd tobacco at a fearful\nrate, spitting in proportion--large clear dark-brown eyes, very\nfine--didn't know what to make of me--told me at last he wanted much\nto get some clean underclothes, and a pair of decent pants. Didn't care\nabout coat or hat fixings. Wanted a chance to wash himself well, and\nput on the underclothes. I had the very great pleasure of helping him to\naccomplish all those wholesome designs.\n\n_March 1st_.--Plenty more butternut or clay-color'd escapees every\nday. About 160 came in to-day, a large portion South Carolinians. They\ngenerally take the oath of allegiance, and are sent north, west, or\nextreme south-west if they wish. Several of them told me that the\ndesertions in their army, of men going home, leave or no leave, are far\nmore numerous than their desertions to our side. I saw a very forlorn\nlooking squad of about a hundred, late this afternoon, on their way to\nthe Baltimore depot.\n\n\nTHE CAPITOL BY GAS-LIGHT\n\nTo-night I have been wandering awhile in the capitol, which is all lit\nup. The illuminated rotunda looks fine. I like to stand aside and look a\nlong, long while, up at the dome; it comforts me somehow. The House and\nSenate were both in session till very late. I look'd in upon them, but\nonly a few moments; they were hard at work on tax and appropriation\nbills. I wander'd through the long and rich corridors and apartments\nunder the Senate; an old habit of mine, former winters, and now more\nsatisfaction than ever. Not many persons down there, occasionally a\nflitting figure in the distance.\n\n\nTHE INAUGURATION\n\n_March 4th._--The President very quietly rode down to the capitol in his\nown carriage, by himself, on a sharp trot, about noon, either because\nhe wish'd to be on hand to sign bills, or to get rid of marching in line\nwith the absurd procession, the muslin temple of liberty and pasteboard\nmonitor. I saw him on his return, at three o'clock, after the\nperformance was over. He was in his plain two-horse barouche, and look'd\nvery much worn and tired; the lines, indeed, of vast responsibilities,\nintricate questions, and demands of life and death, cut deeper than ever\nupon his dark brown face; yet all the old goodness, tenderness, sadness,\nand canny shrewdness, underneath the furrows. (I never see that man\nwithout feeling that he is one to become personally attach'd to, for his\ncombination of purest, heartiest tenderness, and native western form of\nmanliness.) By his side sat his little boy, of ten years. There were no\nsoldiers, only a lot of civilians on horseback, with huge yellow scarfs\nover their shoulders, riding around the carriage. (At the inauguration\nfour years ago, he rode down and back again surrounded by a dense\nmass of arm'd cavalrymen eight deep, with drawn sabres; and there were\nsharpshooters station'd at every corner on the route.) I ought to make\nmention of the closing levee of Saturday night last. Never before was\nsuch a compact jam in front of the White House--all the grounds fill'd,\nand away out to the spacious sidewalks. I was there, as I took a\nnotion to go--was in the rush inside with the crowd--surged along the\npassage-ways, the blue and other rooms, and through the great east room.\nCrowds of country people, some very funny. Fine music from the Marine\nband, off in a side place. I saw Mr. Lincoln, drest all in black, with\nwhite kid gloves and a claw-hammer coat, receiving, as in duty bound,\nshaking hands, looking very disconsolate, and as if he would give\nanything to be somewhere else.\n\n\nATTITUDE OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DURING THE WAR\n\nLooking over my scraps, I find I wrote the following during 1864. The\nhappening to our America, abroad as well as at home, these years, is\nindeed most strange. The democratic republic has paid her today the\nterrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the\nnations of the world that her union should be broken, her future\ncut off, and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level\nof kingdoms and empires ordinarily great. There is certainly not one\ngovernment in Europe but is now watching the war in this country, with\nthe ardent prayer that the United States may be effectually split,\ncrippled, and dismember'd by it. There is not one but would help toward\nthat dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is the ardent wish to-day of\nEngland and of France, as governments, and of all the nations of Europe,\nas governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real, heartfelt wish\nof all the nations of the world, with the single exception of\nMexico--Mexico, the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong,\nand now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph, with genuine\nprayer. Is it not indeed strange? America, made up of all, cheerfully\nfrom the beginning opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of\nall, of Britain, Germany, France and Spain--all here--the accepter, the\nfriend, hope, last resource and general house of all--she who has\nharm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to millions, the mother of\nstrangers and exiles, all nations--should now, I say, be paid this dread\ncompliment of general governmental fear and hatred. Are we indignant?\nalarm'd? Do we feel jeopardized? No; help'd, braced, concentrated,\nrather. We are all too prone to wander from ourselves, to affect Europe,\nand watch her frowns and smiles. We need this hot lesson of general\nhatred, and henceforth must never forget it. Never again will we trust\nthe moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single _government_ of\nthe old world.\n\n\nTHE WEATHER--DOES IT SYMPATHIZE WITH THESE TIMES?\n\nWhether the rains, the heat and cold, and what underlies them all,\nare affected with what affects man in masses, and follow his play of\npassionate action, strain'd stronger than usual, and on a larger scale\nthan usual--whether this, or no, it is certain that there is now, and\nhas been for twenty months or more, on this American continent north,\nmany a remarkable, many an unprecedented expression of the subtile world\nof air above us and around us. There, since this war, and the wide and\ndeep national agitation, strange analogies, different combinations, a\ndifferent sunlight, or absence of it; different products even out of the\nground. After every great battle, a great storm. Even civic events the\nsame. On Saturday last, a forenoon like whirling demons, dark, with\nslanting rain, full of rage; and then the afternoon, so calm, so bathed\nwith flooding splendor from heaven's most excellent sun, with atmosphere\nof sweetness; so clear, it show'd the stars, long long before they were\ndue. As the President came out on the capitol portico, a curious little\nwhite cloud, the only one in that part of the sky, appear'd like a\nhovering bird, right over him.\n\nIndeed, the heavens, the elements, all the meteorological influences,\nhave run riot for weeks past. Such caprices, abruptest alternation of\nfrowns and beauty, I never knew. It is a common remark that (as last\nsummer was different in its spells of intense heat from any preceding\nit,) the winter just completed has been without parallel. It has\nremain'd so down to the hour I am writing. Much of the daytime of the\npast month was sulky, with leaden heaviness, fog, interstices of bitter\ncold, and some insane storms. But there have been samples of another\ndescription. Nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty\nthan some of the nights lately here. The western star, Venus, in the\nearlier hours of evening, has never been so large, so clear; it seems\nas if it told something, as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity,\nwith us Americans. Five or six nights since, it hung close by the moon,\nthen a little past its first quarter. The star was wonderful, the moon\nlike a young mother. The sky, dark blue, the transparent night, the\nplanets, the moderate west wind, the elastic temperature, the miracle of\nthat great star, and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west,\nsuffused the soul. Then I heard, slow and clear, the deliberate notes of\na bugle come up out of the silence, sounding so good through the night's\nmystery, no hurry, but firm and faithful, floating along, rising,\nfalling leisurely, with here and there a long-drawn note; the bugle,\nwell play'd, sounding tattoo, in one of the army hospitals near here,\nwhere the wounded (some of them personally so dear to me,) are lying\nin their cots, and many a sick boy come down to the war from Illinois,\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the rest.\n\n\nINAUGURATION BALL\n\n_March 6_.--I have been up to look at the dance and supper-rooms,\nfor the inauguration ball at the Patent office; and I could not help\nthinking, what a different scene they presented to my view a while\nsince, fill'd with a crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war,\nbrought in from second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburgh.\nTo-night, beautiful women, perfumes, the violin's sweetness, the polka\nand the waltz; then the amputation, the blue face, the groan, the glassy\neye of the dying, the clotted rag, the odor of wounds and blood, and\nmany a mother's son amid strangers, passing away untended there, (for\nthe crowd of the badly hurt was great, and much for nurse to do, and\nmuch for surgeon.)\n\n\nSCENE AT THE CAPITOL\n\nI must mention a strange scene at the capitol, the hall of\nRepresentatives, the morning of Saturday last, (March 4th.) The day just\ndawn'd, but in half-darkness, everything dim, leaden, and soaking. In\nthat dim light, the members nervous from long drawn duty, exhausted,\nsome asleep, and many half asleep. The gas-light, mix'd with the\ndingy day-break, produced an unearthly effect. The poor little sleepy,\nstumbling pages, the smell of the hall, the members with heads leaning\non their desks, the sounds of the voices speaking, with unusual\nintonations--the general moral atmosphere also of the close of this\nimportant session--the strong hope that the war is approaching its\nclose--the tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a false one--the\ngrandeur of the hall itself, with its effect of vast shadows up toward\nthe panels and spaces over the galleries--all made a mark'd combination.\n\nIn the midst of this, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, burst one of\nthe most angry and crashing storms of rain and hail ever heard. It\nbeat like a deluge on the heavy glass roof of the hall, and the wind\nliterally howl'd and roar'd. For a moment, (and no wonder,) the nervous\nand sleeping Representatives were thrown into confusion. The slumberers\nawaked with fear, some started for the doors, some look'd up with\nblanch'd cheeks and lips to the roof, and the little pages began to cry;\nit was a scene. But it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were\nactually awake. They recover'd themselves; the storm raged on, beating,\ndashing, and with loud noises at times. But the House went ahead with\nits business then, I think, as calmly and with as much deliberation as\nat any time in its career. Perhaps the shock did it good. (One is not\nwithout impression, after all, amid these members of Congress, of both\nthe Houses, that if the flat routine of their duties should ever be\nbroken in upon by some great emergency involving real danger, and\ncalling for first-class personal qualities, those qualities would be\nfound generally forthcoming, and from men not now credited with them.)\n\n\nA YANKEE ANTIQUE\n\n_March 27, 1865_.--Sergeant Calvin F. Harlowe, company C, 29th\nMassachusetts, 3d brigade, 1st division, Ninth corps--a mark'd sample\nof heroism and death, (some may say bravado, but I say heroism, of\ngrandest, oldest order)--in the late attack by the rebel troops, and\ntemporary capture by them, of fort Steadman, at night. The fort was\nsurprised at dead of night. Suddenly awaken'd from their sleep, and\nrushing from their tents, Harlowe, with others, found himself in the\nhands of the secesh--they demanded his surrender--he answer'd, _Never\nwhile I live_. (Of course it was useless. The others surrender'd; the\nodds were too great.) Again he was ask'd to yield, this time by a rebel\ncaptain. Though surrounded, and quite calm, he again refused, call'd\nsternly to his comrades to fight on, and himself attempted to do so.\nThe rebel captain then shot him--but at the same instant he shot the\ncaptain. Both fell together mortally wounded. Harlowe died almost\ninstantly. The rebels were driven out in a very short time. The body\nwas buried next day, but soon taken up and sent home, (Plymouth county,\nMass.) Harlowe was only 22 years of age--was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd,\nblue-eyed young man--had come out originally with the 29th; and that\nis the way he met his death, after four years' campaign. He was in the\nSeven Days fight before Richmond, in second Bull Run, Antietam, first\nFredericksburgh, Vicksburgh, Jackson, Wilderness, and the campaigns\nfollowing--was as good a soldier as ever wore the blue, and every old\nofficer in the regiment will bear that testimony. Though so young, and\nin a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero\nin the books, ancient or modern--It was too great to say the words \"I\nsurrender\"--and so he died. (When I think of such things, knowing them\nwell, all the vast and complicated events of the war, on which history\ndwells and makes its volumes, fall aside, and for the moment at any rate\nI see nothing but young Calvin Harlowe's figure in the night, disdaining\nto surrender.)\n\n\nWOUNDS AND DISEASES\n\nThe war is over, but the hospitals are fuller than ever, from former and\ncurrent cases. A large' majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs.\nBut there is every kind of wound, in every part of the body. I should\nsay of the sick, from my observation, that the prevailing maladies\nare typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally, diarrhoea, catarrhal\naffections and bronchitis, rheumatism and pneumonia. These forms of\nsickness lead; all the rest follow. There are twice as many sick as\nthere are wounded. The deaths range from seven to ten per cent, of those\nunder treatment.[7]\n\n\nNote:\n\n[7] In the U. S. Surgeon-General's office since, there is a formal\nrecord and treatment of 153, 142 cases of wounds by government surgeons.\nWhat must have been the number unofficial, indirect--to say nothing of\nthe Southern armies?\n\n\nDEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN\n\n_April 16, '65_.--I find in my notes of the time, this passage on the\ndeath of Abraham Lincoln: He leaves for America's history and biography,\nso far, not only its most dramatic reminiscence--he leaves, in my\nopinion, the greatest, best, most characteristic, artistic, moral\npersonality. Not but that he had faults, and show'd them in the\nPresidency; but honesty, goodness, shrewdness, conscience, and (a new\nvirtue, unknown to other lands, and hardly yet really known here, but\nthe foundation and tie of all, as the future will grandly develop,)\nUNIONISM, in its truest and amplest sense, form'd the hard-pan of his\ncharacter. These he seal'd with his life. The tragic splendor of his\ndeath, purging, illuminating all, throws round his form, his head, an\naureole that will remain and will grow brighter through time, while\nhistory lives, and love of country lasts. By many has this Union been\nhelp'd; but if one name, one man, must be pick'd out, he, most of all,\nis the conservator of it, to the future. He was assassinated--but the\nUnion is not assassinated--_ca ira_! One falls and another falls. The\nsoldier drops, sinks like a wave--but the ranks of the ocean\neternally press on. Death does its work, obliterates a hundred, a\nthousand--President, general, captain, private,--but the Nation is\nimmortal.\n\n\nSHERMAN'S ARMY'S JUBILATION--ITS SUDDEN STOPPAGE\n\nWhen Sherman's armies, (long after they left Atlanta,) were marching\nthrough Southand North Carolina--after leaving Savannah, the news of\nLee's capitulation having been receiv'd--the men never mov'd a mile\nwithout from some part of the line sending up continued, inspiriting\nshouts. At intervals all day long sounded out the wild music of those\npeculiar army cries. They would be commenc'd by one regiment or brigade,\nimmediately taken up by others, and at length whole corps and armies\nwould join in these wild triumphant choruses. It was one of the\ncharacteristic expressions of the western troops, and became a habit,\nserving as a relief and outlet to the men--a vent for their feelings of\nvictory, returning peace, &c. Morning, noon, and afternoon, spontaneous,\nfor occasion or without occasion, these huge, strange cries, differing\nfrom any other, echoing through the open air for many a mile, expressing\nyouth, joy, wildness, irrepressible strength, and the ideas of advance\nand conquest, sounded along the swamps and uplands of the South,\nfloating to the skies. (\"There never were men that kept in better\nspirits in danger or defeat--what then could they do in victory?\"--said\none of the 15th corps to me, afterwards.) This exuberance continued till\nthe armies arrived at Raleigh. There the news of the President's murder\nwas receiv'd. Then no more shouts or yells, for a week. All the marching\nwas comparatively muffled. It was very significant--hardly a loud word\nor laugh in many of the regiments. A hush and silence pervaded all.\n\n\nNO GOOD PORTRAIT OF LINCOLN\n\nProbably the reader has seen physiognomies (often old farmers,\nsea-captains, and such) that, behind their homeliness, or even ugliness,\nheld superior points so subtle, yet so palpable, making the real life\nof their faces almost as impossible to depict as a wild perfume or\nfruit-taste, or a passionate tone of the living voice--and such was\nLincoln's face, the peculiar color, the lines of it, the eyes, mouth,\nexpression. Of technical beauty it had nothing--but to the eye of a\ngreat artist it furnished a rare study, a feast and fascination. The\ncurrent portraits are all failures--most of them caricatures.\n\n\nRELEAS'D UNION PRISONERS FROM SOUTH\n\nThe releas'd prisoners of war are now coming up from the southern\nprisons. I have seen a number of them. The sight is worse than any sight\nof battle-fields, or any collection of wounded, even the bloodiest.\nThere was, (as a sample,) one large boat load, of several hundreds,\nbrought about the 25th, to Annapolis; and out of the whole number only\nthree individuals were able to walk from the boat. The rest were carried\nashore and laid down in one place or another. Can those be _men_--those\nlittle livid brown, ash-streak'd, monkey-looking dwarfs?--are they\nreally not mummied, dwindled corpses? They lay there, most of them,\nquite still, but with a horrible look in their eyes and skinny lips\n(often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth.) Probably\nno more appalling sight was ever seen on this earth. (There are deeds,\ncrimes, that may be forgiven; but this is not among them. It steeps its\nperpetrators in blackest, escapeless, endless damnation. Over 50,000\nhave been compell' d to die the death of starvation--reader, did\nyou ever try to realize what _starvation_ actually is?--in those\nprisons--and in a land of plenty.) An indescribable meanness, tyranny,\naggravating course of insults, almost incredible--was evidently the rule\nof treatment through all the southern military prisons. The dead there\nare not to be pitied as much as some of the living that come from\nthere--if they can be call' d living--many of them are mentally\nimbecile, and will never recuperate.[8]\n\n\nNote:\n\n[8] _From a review of_ \"ANDERSONVILLE, A STORY OF SOUTHERN MILTTARY\nPRISONS,\" _published serially in the Toledo \"Blade\" in 1879, and\nafterwards in book form_.\n\n\"There is a deep fascination in the subject of Andersonville--for that\nGolgotha, in which lie the whitening bones of 13,000 gallant young\nmen, represents the dearest and costliest sacrifice of the war for the\npreservation of our national unity. It is a type, too, of its class. Its\nmore than hundred hecatombs of dead represent several times that number\nof their brethren, for whom the prison gates of Belle Isle, Danville,\nSalisbury, Florence, Columbia, and Cahaba open'd only in eternity. There\nare few families in the North who have not at least one dear relative or\nfriend among these 60,000 whose sad fortune it was to end their service\nfor the Union by lying down and dying for it in a southern prison pen.\nThe manner of their death, the horrors that cluster'd thickly around\nevery moment of their existence, the loyal, unfaltering steadfastness\nwith which they endured all that fate had brought them, has never been\nadequately told. It was not with them as with their comrades in the\nfield, whose every act was perform'd in the presence of those whose duty\nit was to observe such matters and report them to the world. Hidden from\nthe view of their friends in the north by the impenetrable veil\nwhich the military operations of the rebels drew around the so-called\nconfederacy, the people knew next to nothing of their career or their\nsufferings. Thousands died there less heeded even than the hundreds\nwho perish'd on the battlefield. Grant did not lose as many men kill'd\noutright, in the terrible campaign from the Wilderness to the James\nriver--43 days of desperate fighting--as died in July and August at\nAndersonville. Nearly twice as many died in that prison as fell from the\nday that Grant cross'd the Rapidan, till he settled down in the trenches\nbefore Petersburg. More than four times as many Union dead lie under\nthe solemn soughing pines about that forlorn little village in southern\nGeorgia, than mark the course of Sherman from Chattanooga to Atlanta.\nThe nation stands aghast at the expenditure of life which attended the\ntwo bloody campaigns of 1864, which virtually crush'd the confederacy,\nbut no one remembers that more Union soldiers died in the rear of the\nrebel lines than were kill'd in the front of them. The great military\nevents which stamp'd out the rebellion drew attention away from the sad\ndrama which starvation and disease play'd in those gloomy pens in the\nfar recesses of sombre southern forests.\"\n\n_From a letter of \"Johnny Bouquet,\" in N. Y. \"Tribune,\" March 27, '81._\n\n\"I visited at Salisbury, N. C., the prison pen or the site of it, from\nwhich nearly 11,000 victims of southern politicians were buried, being\nconfined in a pen without shelter, exposed to all the elements could do,\nto all the disease herding animals together could create, and to all\nthe starvation and cruelty an incompetent and intense caitiff government\ncould accomplish. From the conversation and almost from the recollection\nof the northern people this place has dropp' d, but not so in the gossip\nof the Salisbury people, nearly all of whom say that the half was\nnever told; that such was the nature of habitual outrage here that when\nFederal prisoners escaped the townspeople harbor'd them in their barns,\nafraid the vengeance of God would fall on them, to deliver even their\nenemies back to such cruelty. Said one old man at the Boyden House, who\njoin'd in the conversation one evening: 'There were often men buried out\nof that prison pen still alive. I have the testimony of a surgeon that\nhe had seen them pull'd out of the dead cart with their eyes open and\ntaking notice, but too weak to lift a finger. There was not the least\nexcuse for such treatment, as the confederate government had seized\nevery sawmill in the region, and could just as well have put up shelter\nfor these prisoners as not, wood being plentiful here. It will be hard\nto make any honest man in Salisbury say that there was the slightest\nnecessity for those prisoners having to live in old tents, caves\nand holes half-full of water. Representations were made to the Davis\ngovernment against the officers in charge of it, but no attention\nwas paid to them. Promotion was the punishment for cruelty there. The\ninmates were skeletons. Hell could have no terrors for any man who died\nthere, except the inhuman keepers.'\"\n\n\nDEATH OF A PENNSYLVANIA SOLDIER\n\n_Frank H. Irwin, company E, 93rd Pennsylvania--died May 1, '65--My\nletter to his mother_--Dear madam: No doubt you and Frank's friends have\nheard the sad fact of his death in hospital here, through his uncle,\nor the lady from Baltimore, who took his things. (I have not seen them,\nonly heard of them visiting Frank.) I will write you a few lines--as\na casual friend that sat by his death-bed. Your son, corporal Frank H.\nIrwin, was wounded near fort Fisher, Virginia, March 25th, 1865--the\nwound was in the left knee, pretty bad. He was sent up to Washington,\nwas receiv'd in ward C, Armory-square hospital, March 28th--the wound\nbecame worse, and on the 4th of April the leg was amputated a little\nabove the knee--the operation was perform' d by Dr. Bliss, one of the\nbest surgeons in the army--he did the whole operation himself--there was\na good deal of bad matter gather'd--the bullet was found in the knee.\nFor a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty well. I visited\nand sat by him frequently, as he was fond of having me. The last ten or\ntwelve days of April I saw that his case was critical. He previously had\nsome fever, with cold spells. The last week in April he was much of\nthe time flighty--but always mild and gentle. He died first of May. The\nactual cause of death was pyaemia, (the absorption of the matter in the\nsystem instead of its discharge.) Frank, as far as I saw, had everything\nrequisite in surgical treatment, nursing, &c. He had watches much of the\ntime. He was so good and well-behaved and affectionate, I myself liked\nhim very much. I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by\nhim, and soothing him, and he liked to have me--liked to put his arm out\nand lay his hand on my knee--would keep it so a long while. Toward the\nlast he was more restless and flighty at night--often fancied himself\nwith his regiment--by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings\nwere hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely\ninnocent of--said, \"I never in my life was thought capable of such a\nthing, and never was.\" At other times he would fancy himself talking as\nit seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I suppose, and giving\nthem good advice; would talk to them a long while. All the time he was\nout of his head not one single bad word or idea escaped him. It was\nremark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as\ngood as Frank's delirium. He seem'd quite willing to die--he had become\nvery weak and had suffer'd a good deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor\nboy. I do not know his past life, but I feel as if it must have\nbeen good. At any rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying\ncircumstances, with a painful wound, and among strangers, I can say\nthat he behaved so brave, so composed, and so sweet and affectionate,\nit could not be surpass'd. And now like many other noble and good men,\nafter serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life\nat the very outset in her service. Such things are gloomy--yet there\nis a text, \"God doeth all things well\"--the meaning of which, after due\ntime, appears to the soul.\n\nI thought perhaps a few words, though from a stranger, about your son,\nfrom one who was with him at the last, might be worth while--for I loved\nthe young man, though I but saw him immediately to lose him. I am merely\na friend visiting the hospitals occasionally to cheer the wounded and\nsick.\n\nW. W.\n\n\nTHE ARMIES RETURNING\n\n_May 7_.--Sunday.--To-day as I was walking a mile or two south of\nAlexandria, I fell in with several large squads of the returning Western\narmy, (Sherman's men as they call'd themselves) about a thousand in all,\nthe largest portion of them half sick, some convalescents, on their way\nto a hospital camp. These fragmentary excerpts, with the unmistakable\nWestern physiognomy and idioms, crawling along slowly--after a great\ncampaign, blown this way, as it were, out of their latitude--I mark'd\nwith curiosity, and talk'd with off and on for over an hour. Here and\nthere was one very sick; but all were able to walk, except some of\nthe last, who had given out, and were seated on the ground, faint and\ndespondent. These I tried to cheer, told them the camp they were to\nreach was only a little way further over the hill, and so got them up\nand started, accompanying some of the worst a little way, and helping\nthem, or putting them under the support of stronger comrades.\n\n_May 21_.--Saw General Sheridan and his cavalry to-day; a strong,\nattractive sight; the men were mostly young, (a few middle-aged,)\nsuperb-looking fellows, brown, spare, keen, with well-worn clothing,\nmany with pieces of water-proof cloth around their shoulders, hanging\ndown. They dash'd along pretty fast, in wide close ranks, all spatter'd\nwith mud; no holiday soldiers; brigade after brigade. I could have\nwatch'd for a week. Sheridan stood on a balcony, under a big tree,\ncoolly smoking a cigar. His looks and manner impress'd me favorably.\n\n_May 22_.--Have been taking a walk along Pennsylvania avenue and Seventh\nstreet north. The city is full of soldiers, running around loose.\nOfficers everywhere, of all grades. All have the weatherbeaten look of\npractical service. It is a sight I never tire of. All the armies are\nnow here (or portions of them,) for to-morrow's review. You see them\nswarming like bees everywhere.\n\n\nTHE GRAND REVIEW\n\nFor two days now the broad spaces of Pennsylvania avenue along to\nTreasury hill, and so by detour around to the President's house, and so\nup to Georgetown, and across the aqueduct bridge, have been alive with a\nmagnificent sight, the returning armies. In their wide ranks stretching\nclear across the Avenue, I watch them march or ride along, at a brisk\npace, through two whole days--infantry, cavalry, artillery--some 200,000\nmen. Some days afterwards one or two other corps; and then, still\nafterwards, a good part of Sherman's immense army, brought up from\nCharleston, Savannah, &c.\n\n\nWESTERN SOLDIERS\n\n_May 26-7_.--The streets, the public buildings and grounds of\nWashington, still swarm with soldiers from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\nMissouri, Iowa, and all the Western States. I am continually meeting and\ntalking with them. They often speak to me first, and always show great\nsociability, and glad to have a good interchange of chat. These Western\nsoldiers are more slow in their movements, and in their intellectual\nquality also; have no extreme alertness. They are larger in size, have a\nmore serious physiognomy, are continually looking at you as they pass in\nthe street. They are largely animal, and handsomely so. During the war\nI have been at times with the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and\nTwentieth Corps. I always feel drawn toward the men, and like their\npersonal contact when we are crowded close together, as frequently these\ndays in the street-cars. They all think the world of General Sherman;\ncall him \"old Bill,\" or sometimes \"uncle Billy.\"\n\n\nA SOLDIER ON LINCOLN\n\n_May 28_.--As I sat by the bedside of a sick Michigan soldier in\nhospital to-day, a convalescent from the adjoining bed rose and came to\nme, and presently we began talking. He was a middleaged man, belonged\nto the 2d Virginia regiment, but lived in Racine, Ohio, and had a family\nthere. He spoke of President Lincoln, and said: \"The war is over, and\nmany are lost. And now we have lost the best, the fairest, the truest\nman in America. Take him altogether, he was the best man this country\never produced. It was quite a while I thought very different; but some\ntime before the murder, that's the way I have seen it.\" There was deep\nearnestness in the soldier. (I found upon further talk he had known Mr.\nLincoln personally, and quite closely, years before.) He was a veteran;\nwas now in the fifth year of his service; was a cavalry man, and had\nbeen in a good deal of hard fighting.\n\n\nTWO BROTHERS, ONE SOUTH, ONE NORTH\n\n_May 28-9_.--I staid to-night a long time by the bedside of a new\npatient, a young Baltimorean, aged about 19 years, W. S. P., (2d\nMaryland, southern,) very feeble, right leg amputated, can't sleep\nhardly at all--has taken a great deal of morphine, which, as usual,\nis costing more than it comes to. Evidently very intelligent and well\nbred--very affectionate--held on to my hand, and put it by his face, not\nwilling to let me leave. As I was lingering, soothing him in his pain,\nhe says to me suddenly, \"I hardly think you know who I am--I don't wish\nto impose upon you--I am a rebel soldier.\" I said I did not know that,\nbut it made no difference. Visiting him daily for about two weeks after\nthat, while he lived, (death had mark'd him, and he was quite alone,) I\nloved him much, always kiss'd him, and he did me. In an adjoining ward\nI found his brother, an officer of rank, a Union soldier, a brave and\nreligious man, (Col. Clifton K. Prentiss, sixth Maryland infantry,\nSixth corps, wounded in one of the engagements at Petersburgh, April\n2--linger'd, suffer'd much, died in Brooklyn, Aug. 20, '65). It was\nin the same battle both were hit. One was a strong Unionist, the other\nSecesh; both fought on their respective sides, both badly wounded, and\nboth brought together here after a separation of four years. Each died\nfor his cause.\n\n\nSOME SAD CASES YET\n\n_May 31_.--James H. Williams, aged 21, 3d Virginia cavalry.-About as\nmark'd a case of a strong man brought low by a complication of diseases,\n(laryngitis, fever, debility and diarrhoea,) as I have ever seen--has\nsuperb physique, remains swarthy yet, and flushed and red with fever-is\naltogether flighty--flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous, and\npulse pounding away with treble quickness--lies a good deal of the time\nin a partial sleep, but with low muttering and groans--a sleep in which\nthere is no rest. Powerful as he is, and so young, he will not be able\nto stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and\nto-day. His throat is in a bad way, tongue and lips parch'd. When I ask\nhim how he feels, he is able just to articulate, \"I feel pretty bad\nyet, old man,\" and looks at me with his great bright eyes. Father, John\nWilliams, Millensport, Ohio.\n\n_June 9-10_.--I have been sitting late to-night by the bedside of a\nwounded captain, a special friend of mine, lying with a painful fracture\nof left leg in one of the hospitals, in a large ward partially vacant.\nThe lights were put out, all but a little candle, far from where I\nsat. The full moon shone in through the windows, making long, slanting\nsilvery patches on the floor. All was still, my friend too was silent,\nbut could not sleep; so I sat there by him, slowly wafting the fan, and\noccupied with the musings that arose out of the scene, the long shadowy\nward, the beautiful ghostly moonlight on the floor, the white beds, here\nand there an occupant with huddled form, the bed-clothes thrown off. The\nhospitals have a number of cases of sun-stroke and exhaustion by heat,\nfrom the late reviews. There are many such from the Sixth corps, from\nthe hot parade of day before yesterday. (Some of these shows cost the\nlives of scores of men.)\n\n_Sunday, Sep. 10_.--Visited Douglas and Stanton hospitals. They are\nquite full. Many of the cases are bad ones, lingering wounds, and old\nsickness. There is a more than usual look of despair on the countenances\nof many of the men; hope has left them. I went through the wards,\ntalking as usual. There are several here from the confederate army whom\nI had seen in other hospitals, and they recognized me. Two were in a\ndying condition.\n\n\nCALHOUN'S REAL MONUMENT\n\nIn one of the hospital tents for special cases, as I sat to-day tending\na new amputation, I heard a couple of neighboring soldiers talking to\neach other from their cots. One down with fever, but improving, had come\nup belated from Charleston not long before. The other was what we now\ncall an \"old veteran,\" (_i.e._, he was a Connecticut youth, probably of\nless than the age of twenty-five years, the four last of which he had\nspent in active service in the war in all parts of the country.) The two\nwere chatting of one thing and another. The fever soldier spoke of John\nC. Calhoun's monument, which he had seen, and was describing it. The\nveteran said: \"I have seen Calhoun's monument. That you saw is not the\nreal monument. But I have seen it. It is the desolated, ruined south;\nnearly the whole generation of young men between seventeen and\nthirty destroyed or maim'd; all the old families used up--the rich\nimpoverish'd, the plantations cover'd with weeds, the slaves unloos'd\nand become the masters, and the name of southerner blacken'd with every\nshame--all that is Calhoun's real monument.\"\n\n\nHOSPITALS CLOSING\n\n_October 3_.--There are two army hospitals now remaining. I went to the\nlargest of these (Douglas) and spent the afternoon and evening. There\nare many sad cases, old wounds, incurable sickness, and some of the\nwounded from the March and April battles before Richmond. Few realize\nhow sharp and bloody those closing battles were. Our men exposed\nthemselves more than usual; press'd ahead without urging. Then the\nsoutherners fought with extra desperation. Both sides knew that with the\nsuccessful chasing of the rebel cabal from Richmond, and the occupation\nof that city by the national troops, the game was up. The dead and\nwounded were unusually many. Of the wounded the last lingering driblets\nhave been brought to hospital here. I find many rebel wounded here, and\nhave been extra busy to-day 'tending to the worst cases of them with the\nrest.\n\n_Oct., Nov. and Dec., '65--Sundays_--Every Sunday of these months\nvisited Harewood hospital out in the woods, pleasant and recluse, some\ntwo and a half or three miles north of the capitol. The situation is\nhealthy, with broken ground, grassy slopes and patches of oak woods, the\ntrees large and fine. It was one of the most extensive of the hospitals,\nnow reduced to four or five partially occupied wards, the numerous\nothers being vacant. In November, this became the last military hospital\nkept up by the government, all the others being closed. Cases of the\nworst and most incurable wounds, obstinate illness, and of poor fellows\nwho have no homes to go to, are found here.\n\n_Dec. 10--Sunday_--Again spending a good part of the day at Harewood.\nI write this about an hour before sundown. I have walk'd out for a few\nminutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the hour and\nscene. It is a glorious, warm, golden-sunny, still afternoon. The only\nnoise is from a crowd of cawing crows, on some trees three hundred\nyards distant. Clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all\ndirections. The oak leaves are thick under the bare trees, and give a\nstrong and delicious perfume. Inside the wards everything is gloomy.\nDeath is there. As I enter'd, I was confronted by it the first thing;\na corpse of a poor soldier, just dead, of typhoid fever. The attendants\nhad just straighten'd the limbs, put coppers on the eyes, and were\nlaying it out.\n\n_The roads_--A great recreation, the past three years, has been in\ntaking long walks out from Washington, five, seven, perhaps ten miles\nand back; generally with my friend Peter Doyle, who is as fond of it as\nI am. Fine moonlight nights, over the perfect military roads, hard\nand smooth--or Sundays--we had these delightful walks, never to be\nforgotten. The roads connecting Washington and the numerous forts around\nthe city, made one useful result, at any rate, out of the war.\n\n\nTYPICAL SOLDIERS\n\nEven the typical soldiers I have been personally intimate with,--it\nseems to me if I were to make a list of them it would be like a city\ndirectory. Some few only have I mention'd in the foregoing pages--most\nare dead--a few yet living. There is Reuben Farwell, of Michigan,\n(little \"Mitch;\") Benton H. Wilson, color-bearer, 185th New York; Wm.\nStansberry; Manvill Winterstein, Ohio; Bethuel Smith; Capt. Simms, of\n51st New York, (kill'd at Petersburgh mine explosion,) Capt. Sam. Pooley\nand Lieut. Fred. McReady, same reg't. Also, same reg't., my brother,\nGeorge W. Whitman--in active service all through, four years,\nre-enlisting twice--was promoted, step by step, (several times\nimmediately after battles,) lieutenant, captain, major and lieut.\ncolonel--was in the actions at Roanoke, Newbern, 2d Bull Run, Chantilly,\nSouth Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburgh, Vicksburgh, Jackson, the\nbloody conflicts of the Wilderness, and at Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor,\nand afterwards around Petersburgh; at one of these latter was taken\nprisoner, and pass'd four or five months in secesh military prisons,\nnarrowly escaping with life, from a severe fever, from starvation and\nhalf-nakedness in the winter. (What a history that 51st New York had!\nWent out early--march'd, fought everywhere--was in storms at sea, nearly\nwreck'd--storm'd forts--tramp'd hither and yon in Virginia,\nnight and day, summer of '62--afterwards Kentucky and\nMississippi--re-enlisted--was in all the engagements and campaigns, as\nabove.) I strengthen and comfort myself much with the certainty that\nthe capacity for just such regiments, (hundreds, thousands of them) is\ninexhaustible in the United States, and that there isn't a county nor a\ntownship in the republic--nor a street in any city--but could turn out,\nand, on occasion, would turn out, lots of just such typical soldiers,\nwhenever wanted.\n\n\n\"CONVULSIVENESS\"\n\nAs I have look'd over the proof-sheets of the preceding pages, I have\nonce or twice fear'd that my diary would prove, at best, but a batch of\nconvulsively written reminiscences. Well, be it so.\n\nThey are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke and excitement\nof those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it,\ncan indeed be best described by that very word _convulsiveness_.\n\n\nTHREE YEARS SUMM'D UP\n\nDuring those three years in hospital, camp or field, I made over six\nhundred visits or tours, and went, as I estimate, counting all, among\nfrom eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick,\nas sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in time of need. These\nvisits varied from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear\nor critical cases I generally watch'd all night. Sometimes I took up my\nquarters in the hospital, and slept or watch'd there several nights\nin succession. Those three years I consider the greatest privilege\nand satisfaction, (with all their feverish excitements and physical\ndeprivations and lamentable sights,) and, of course, the most profound\nlesson of my life. I can say that in my ministerings I comprehended\nall, whoever came in my way, northern or southern, and slighted none. It\narous'd and brought out and decided undream'd-of depths of emotion. It\nhas given me my most fervent views of the true _ensemble_ and extent of\nthe States. While I was with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from\nthe New England States, and from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,\nand from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and all the\nWestern States, I was with more or less from all the States, North\nand South, without exception. I was with many from the border States,\nespecially from Maryland and Virginia, and found, during those lurid\nyears 1862-63, far more Union southerners, especially Tennesseans, than\nis supposed. I was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded,\nand gave them always what I had, and tried to cheer them the same as\nany. I was among the army teamsters considerably, and, indeed, always\nfound myself drawn to them. Among the black soldiers, wounded or sick,\nand in the contraband camps, I also took my way whenever in their\nneighborhood, and did what I could for them.\n\n\nTHE MILLION DEAD, TOO, SUMM'D UP\n\nThe dead in this war--there they lie, strewing the fields and woods and\nvalleys and battle-fields of the south--Virginia, the Peninsula--Malvern\nhill and Fair Oaks--the banks of the Chickahominy--the terraces of\nFredericksburgh--Antietam bridge--the grisly ravines of Manassas--the\nbloody promenade of the Wilderness--the varieties of the _strayed_ dead,\n(the estimate of the War department is 25,000 national soldiers kill'd\nin battle and never buried at all, 5,000 drown'd--15,000 inhumed\nby strangers, or on the march in haste, in hitherto unfound\nlocalities--2,000 graves cover'd by sand and mud by Mississippi\nfreshets, 3,000 carried away by caving-in of banks, &c.,)--Gettysburgh,\nthe West, Southwest--Vicksburgh--Chattanooga--the trenches of\nPetersburgh--the numberless battles, camps, hospitals everywhere--the\ncrop reap'd by the mighty reapers, typhoid, dysentery,\ninflammations--and blackest and loathesomest of all, the dead and living\nburial-pits, the prison-pens of Andersonville, Salisbury, Belle-Isle,\n&c., (not Dante's pictured hell and all its woes, its degradations,\nfilthy torments, excell'd those prisons)--the dead, the dead, the\ndead--_our_ dead--or South or North, ours all, (all, all, all,\nfinally dear to me)--or East or West--Atlantic coast or Mississippi\nvalley--somewhere they crawl'd to die, alone, in bushes, low gullies,\nor on the sides of hills--(there, in secluded spots, their skeletons,\nbleach'd bones, tufts of hair, buttons, fragments of clothing, are\noccasionally found yet)--our young men once so handsome and so joyous,\ntaken from us--the son from the mother, the husband from the wife,\nthe dear friend from the dear friend--the clusters of camp graves, in\nGeorgia, the Carolinas, and in Tennessee--the single graves left in\nthe woods or by the roadside, (hundreds, thousands, obliterated)--the\ncorpses floated down the rivers, and caught and lodged, (dozens, scores,\nfloated down the upper Potomac, after the cavalry engagements, the\npursuit of Lee, following Gettysburgh)--some lie at the bottom of the\nsea--the general million, and the special cemeteries in almost all the\nStates--the infinite dead--(the land entire saturated, perfumed with\ntheir impalpable ashes' exhalation in Nature's chemistry distill'd, and\nshall be so forever, in every future grain of wheat and ear of corn, and\nevery flower that grows, and every breath we draw)--not only Northern\ndead leavening Southern soil--thousands, aye tens of thousands, of\nSoutherners, crumble to-day in Northern earth.\n\nAnd everywhere among these countless graves--everywhere in the many\nsoldier Cemeteries of the Nation, (there are now, I believe, over\nseventy of them)--as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories\nof slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles--not only where\nthe scathing trail passed those years, but radiating since in all\nthe peaceful quarters of the land--we see, and ages yet may see, on\nmonuments and gravestones, singly or in masses, to thousands or tens of\nthousands, the significant word UNKNOWN.\n\n(In some of the cemeteries nearly all the dead are unknown. At\nSalisbury, N. C., for instance, the known are only 85, while the unknown\nare 12,027, and 11,700 of these are buried in trenches. A national\nmonument has been put up here, by order of Congress, to mark the\nspot--but what visible, material monument can ever fittingly commemorate\nthat spot?)\n\n\nTHE REAL WAR WILL NEVER GET IN THE BOOKS\n\nAnd so good-bye to the war. I know not how it may have been, or may be,\nto others--to me the main interest I found, (and still, on recollection,\nfind,) in the rank and file of the armies, both sides, and in those\nspecimens amid the hospitals, and even the dead on the field. To me the\npoints illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities\nof these States, in the two or three millions of American young\nand middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in those armies--and\nespecially the one-third or one-fourth of their number, stricken by\nwounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest--were of\nmore significance even than the political interests involved. (As so\nmuch of a race depends on how it faces death, and how it stands personal\nanguish and sickness. As, in the glints of emotions under emergencies,\nand the indirect traits and asides in Plutarch, we get far profounder\nclues to the antique world than all its more formal history.)\n\nFuture years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal\nbackground of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the official\nsurface-courteousness of the Generals, not the few great battles) of the\nSecession war; and it is best they should not--the real war will never\nget in the books. In the mushy influences of current times, too, the\nfervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of\nbeing totally forgotten. I have at night watch'd by the side of a sick\nman in the hospital, one who could not live many hours. I have seen his\neyes flash and burn as he raised himself and recurr'd to the cruelties\non his surrender'd brother, and mutilations of the corpse afterward.\n(See in the preceding pages, the incident at Upperville--the seventeen\nkill'd as in the description, were left there on the ground. After they\ndropt dead, no one touch'd them--all were made sure of, however. The\ncarcasses were left for the citizens to bury or not, as they chose.)\n\nSuch was the war. It was not a quadrille in a ball-room. Its interior\nhistory will not only never be written--its practicality, minutia; of\ndeeds and passions, will never be even suggested. The actual soldier\nof 1862-'65, North and South, with all his ways, his incredible\ndauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his fierce\nfriendship, his appetite, rankness, his superb strength and animality,\nlawless gait, and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp, I say,\nwill never be written--perhaps must not and should not be.\n\nThe preceding notes may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life, and\ninto those lurid interiors, never to be fully convey'd to the future.\nThe hospital part of the drama from '61 to '65, deserves indeed to\nbe recorded. Of that many-threaded drama, with its sudden and strange\nsurprises, its confounding of prophecies, its moments of despair, the\ndread of foreign interference, the interminable campaigns, the bloody\nbattles, the mighty and cumbrous and green armies, the drafts and\nbounties--the immense money expenditure, like a heavy-pouring constant\nrain--with, over the whole land, the last three years of the struggle,\nan unending, universal mourning-wail of women, parents, orphans--the\nmarrow of the tragedy concentrated in those Army Hospitals--(it seem'd\nsometimes as if the whole interest of the land, North and South, was\none vast central hospital, and all the rest of the affair but\nflanges)--those forming the untold and unwritten history of the\nwar--infinitely greater (like life's) than the few scraps and\ndistortions that are ever told or written. Think how much, and\nof importance, will be--how much, civic and military, has already\nbeen--buried in the grave, in eternal darkness.\n\n\nAN INTERREGNUM PARAGRAPH\n\nSeveral years now elapse before I resume my diary. I continued at\nWashington working in the Attorney-General's department through '66 and\n'67, and some time afterward. In February '73 I was stricken down by\nparalysis, gave up my desk, and migrated to Camden, New Jersey, where\nI lived during '74 and '75, quite unwell--but after that began to grow\nbetter; commenc'd going for weeks at a time, even for months, down in\nthe country, to a charmingly recluse and rural spot along Timber creek,\ntwelve or thirteen miles from where it enters the Delaware river.\nDomicil'd at the farm-house of my friends, the Staffords, near by, I\nlived half the time along this creek and its adjacent fields and lanes.\nAnd it is to my life here that I, perhaps, owe partial recovery (a\nsort of second wind, or semi-renewal of the lease of life) from the\nprostration of 1874-'75. If the notes of that outdoor life could only\nprove as glowing to you, reader dear, as the experience itself was to\nme. Doubtless in the course of the following, the fact of invalidism\nwill crop out, (I call myself _a half-Paralytic_ these days, and\nreverently bless the Lord it is no worse,) between some of the\nlines--but I get my share of fun and healthy hours, and shall try to\nindicate them. (The trick is, I find, to tone your wants and tastes low\ndown enough, and make much of negatives, and of mere daylight and the\nskies.)\n\n\nNEW THEMES ENTERED UPON\n\n_1876, '77_.--I find the woods in mid-May and early June my best places\nfor composition.[9] Seated on logs or stumps there, or resting on rails,\nnearly all the following memoranda have been jotted down. Wherever I go,\nindeed, winter or summer, city or country, alone at home or traveling, I\nmust take notes--(the ruling passion strong in age and disablement, and\neven the approach of--but I must not say it yet.) Then underneath the\nfollowing excerpta--crossing the _t's_ and dotting the _i's_ of certain\nmoderate movements of late years--I am fain to fancy the foundations\nof quite a lesson learn'd. After you have exhausted what there is in\nbusiness, politics, conviviality, love, and so on--have found that none\nof these finally satisfy, or permanently wear--what remains? Nature\nremains; to bring out from their torpid recesses, the affinities of\na man or woman with the open air, the trees, fields, the changes of\nseasons--the sun by day and the stars of heaven by night. We will begin\nfrom these convictions. Literature flies so high and is so hotly spiced,\nthat our notes may seem hardly more than breaths of common air, or\ndraughts of water to drink. But that is part of our lesson.\n\nDear, soothing, healthy, restoration-hours--after three confining years\nof paralysis--after the long strain of the war, and its wounds and\ndeath.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[9] Without apology for the abrupt change of field and atmosphere--after\nwhat I have put in the preceding fifty or sixty pages--temporary\nepisodes, thank heaven!--I restore my book to the bracing and buoyant\nequilibrium of concrete outdoor Nature, the only permanent reliance for\nsanity of book or human life.\n\nWho knows, (I have it in my fancy, my ambition,) but the pages now\nensuing may carry ray of sun, or smell of grass or corn, or call of\nbird, or gleam of stars by night, or snow-flakes falling fresh\nand mystic, to denizen of heated city house, or tired workman or\nworkwoman?--or may-be in sick-room or prison--to serve as cooling\nbreeze, or Nature's aroma, to some fever'd mouth or latent pulse.\n\n\nENTERING A LONG FARM-LANE\n\nAs every man has his hobby-liking, mine is for a real farm-lane fenced\nby old chestnut-rails gray-green with dabs of moss and lichen, copious\nweeds and briers growing in spots athwart the heaps of stray-pick' d\nstones at the fence bases--irregular paths worn between, and horse and\ncow tracks--all characteristic accompaniments marking and scenting\nthe neighborhood in their seasons--apple-tree blossoms in forward\nApril--pigs, poultry, a field of August buckwheat, and in another the\nlong flapping tassels of maize--and so to the pond, the expansion of\nthe creek, the secluded-beautiful, with young and old trees, and such\nrecesses and vistas.\n\n\nTO THE SPRING AND BROOK\n\nSo, still sauntering on, to the spring under the willows--musical as\nsoft clinking glasses-pouring a sizeable stream, thick as my neck, pure\nand clear, out from its vent where the bank arches over like a\ngreat brown shaggy eyebrow or mouth-roof--gurgling, gurgling\nceaselessly--meaning, saying something, of course (if one could only\ntranslate it)--always gurgling there, the whole year through--never\ngiving out--oceans of mint, blackberries in summer--choice of light and\nshade--just the place for my July sun-baths and water-baths too--but\nmainly the inimitable soft sound-gurgles of it, as I sit there hot\nafternoons. How they and all grow into me, day after day--everything in\nkeeping--the wild, just-palpable perfume, and the dappled leaf-shadows,\nand all the natural-medicinal, elemental-moral influences of the spot.\n\nBabble on, O brook, with that utterance of thine! I too will express\nwhat I have gather'd in my days and progress, native, subterranean,\npast--and now thee. Spin and wind thy way--I with thee, a little while,\nat any rate. As I haunt thee so often, season by season, thou knowest,\nreckest not me, (yet why be so certain? who can tell?)--but I will learn\nfrom thee, and dwell on thee--receive, copy, print from thee.\n\n\nAN EARLY SUMMER REVEILLE\n\nAway then to loosen, to unstring the divine bow, so tense, so long.\nAway, from curtain, carpet, sofa, book--from \"society\"--from city house,\nstreet, and modern improvements and luxuries--away to the primitive\nwinding, aforementioned wooded creek, with its untrimm'd bushes and\nturfy banks--away from ligatures, tight boots, buttons, and the whole\ncast-iron civilized life--from entourage of artificial store, machine,\nstudio, office, parlor--from tailordom and fashion's clothes--from any\nclothes, perhaps, for the nonce, the summer heats advancing, there in\nthose watery, shaded solitudes. Away, thou soul, (let me pick thee\nout singly, reader dear, and talk in perfect freedom, negligently,\nconfidentially,) for one day and night at least, returning to the\nnaked source-life of us all--to the breast of the great silent savage\nall-acceptive Mother. Alas! how many of us are so sodden--how many have\nwander'd so far away, that return is almost impossible.\n\nBut to my jottings, taking them as they come, from the heap, without\nparticular selection. There is little consecutiveness in dates. They run\nany time within nearly five or six years. Each was carelessly pencilled\nin the open air, at the time and place. The printers will learn this\nto some vexation perhaps, as much of their copy is from those\nhastily-written first notes.\n\n\nBIRDS MIGRATING AT MIDNIGHT\n\nDid you ever chance to hear the midnight flight of birds passing through\nthe air and darkness overhead, in countless armies, changing their early\nor late summer habitat? It is something not to be forgotten. A friend\ncalled me up just after 12 last night to mark the peculiar noise of\nunusually immense flocks migrating north (rather late this year.) In\nthe silence, shadow and delicious odor of the hour, (the natural perfume\nbelonging to the night alone,) I thought it rare music. You could _hear_\nthe characteristic motion--once or twice \"the rush of mighty wings,\"\nbut often a velvety rustle, long drawn out--sometimes quite near--with\ncontinual calls and chirps, and some song-notes. It all lasted from 12\ntill after 3. Once in a while the species was plainly distinguishable;\nI could make out the bobolink, tanager, Wilson's thrush, white-crown'd\nsparrow, and occasionally from high in the air came the notes of the\nplover.\n\n\nBUMBLE-BEES\n\nMay-month--month of swarming, singing, mating birds--the bumble-bee\nmonth--month of the flowering lilac-(and then my own birth-month.) As\nI jot this paragraph, I am out just after sunrise, and down towards the\ncreek. The lights, perfumes, melodies--the blue birds, grass birds\nand robins, in every direction--the noisy, vocal, natural concert. For\nundertones, a neighboring wood-pecker tapping his tree, and the distant\nclarion of chanticleer. Then the fresh-earth smells--the colors, the\ndelicate drabs and thin blues of the perspective. The bright green of\nthe grass has receiv'd an added tinge from the last two days' mildness\nand moisture. How the sun silently mounts in the broad clear sky, on\nhis day's journey! How the warm beams bathe all, and come streaming\nkissingly and almost hot on my face.\n\nA while since the croaking of the pond-frogs and the first white of\nthe dog-wood blossoms. Now the golden dandelions in endless profusion,\nspotting the ground everywhere. The white cherry and pear-blows--the\nwild violets, with their blue eyes looking up and saluting my feet, as\nI saunter the wood-edge--the rosy blush of budding apple-trees--the\nlight-clear emerald hue of the wheat-fields--the darker green of the\nrye--a warm elasticity pervading the air--the cedar-bushes profusely\ndeck'd with their little brown apples--the summer fully awakening--the\nconvocation of black birds, garrulous flocks of them, gathering on some\ntree, and making the hour and place noisy as I sit near.\n\n_Later._--Nature marches in procession, in sections, like the corps of\nan army. All have done much for me, and still do. But for the last two\ndays it has been the great wild bee, the humble-bee, or \"bumble,\" as the\nchildren call him. As I walk, or hobble, from the farm-house down to the\ncreek, I traverse the before-mention'd lane, fenced by old rails, with\nmany splits, splinters, breaks, holes, &c., the choice habitat of those\ncrooning, hairy insects. Up and down and by and between these rails,\nthey swarm and dart and fly in countless myriads. As I wend slowly\nalong, I am often accompanied with a moving cloud of them. They play a\nleading part in my morning, midday or sunset rambles, and often dominate\nthe landscape in a way I never before thought of--fill the long lane,\nnot by scores or hundreds only, but by thousands. Large and vivacious\nand swift, with wonderful momentum and a loud swelling, perpetual hum,\nvaried now and then by something almost like a shriek, they dart to and\nfro, in rapid flashes, chasing each other, and (little things as they\nare,) conveying to me a new and pronounc'd sense of strength, beauty,\nvitality and movement. Are they in their mating season? or what is the\nmeaning of this plenitude, swiftness, eagerness, display? As I walk'd, I\nthought I was follow'd by a particular swarm, but upon observation I saw\nthat it was a rapid succession of changing swarms, one after another.\n\nAs I write, I am seated under a big wild-cherry tree--the warm day\ntemper'd by partial clouds and a fresh breeze, neither too heavy nor\nlight--and here I sit long and long, envelop'd in the deep musical\ndrone of these bees, flitting, balancing, darting to and fro about me\nby hundreds--big fellows with light yellow jackets, great glistening\nswelling bodies, stumpy heads and gauzy wings--humming their perpetual\nrich mellow boom. (Is there not a hint in it for a musical composition,\nof which it should be the back-ground? some bumble-bee symphony?) How\nit all nourishes, lulls me, in the way most needed; the open air, the\nrye-fields, the apple orchards. The last two days have been faultless\nin sun, breeze, temperature and everything; never two more perfect days,\nand I have enjoy'd them wonderfully. My health is somewhat better, and\nmy spirit at peace. (Yet the anniversary of the saddest loss and sorrow\nof my life is close at hand.)\n\nAnother jotting, another perfect day: forenoon, from 7 to 9, two\nhours envelop'd in sound of bumble-bees and bird-music. Down in the\napple-trees and in a neighboring cedar were three or four russet-back'd\nthrushes, each singing his best, and roulading in ways I never heard\nsurpass'd. Two hours I abandon myself to hearing them, and indolently\nabsorbing the scene. Almost every bird I notice has a special time in\nthe year--sometimes limited to a few days--when it sings its best; and\nnow is the period of these russet-backs. Meanwhile, up and down the\nlane, the darting, droning, musical bumble-bees. A great swarm again for\nmy entourage as I return home, moving along with me as before.\n\nAs I write this, two or three weeks later, I am sitting near the brook\nunder a tulip tree, 70 feet high, thick with the fresh verdure of its\nyoung maturity--a beautiful object--every branch, every leaf perfect.\nFrom top to bottom, seeking the sweet juice in the blossoms, it swarms\nwith myriads of these wild bees, whose loud and steady humming makes an\nundertone to the whole, and to my mood and the hour. All of which I\nwill bring to a close by extracting the following verses from Henry A.\nBeers's little volume:\n\n    As I lay yonder in tall grass\n    A drunken bumble-bee went past\n\n    Delirious with honey toddy.\n    The golden sash about his body\n    Scarce kept it in his swollen belly\n    Distent with honeysuckle jelly.\n    Rose liquor and the sweet-pea wine\n    Had fill' d his soul with song divine;\n    Deep had he drunk the warm night through,\n    His hairy thighs were wet with dew.\n    Full many an antic he had play'd\n    While the world went round through sleep and shade.\n    Oft had he lit with thirsty lip\n    Some flower-cup's nectar'd sweets to sip,\n    When on smooth petals he would slip,\n    Or over tangled stamens trip,\n    And headlong in the pollen roll'd,\n    Crawl out quite dusted o'er with gold;\n    Or else his heavy feet would stumble\n    Against some bud, and down he'd tumble\n    Amongst the grass; there lie and grumble\n    In low, soft bass--poor maudlin bumble!\n\n\nCEDAR-APPLES\n\nAs I journey'd to-day in a light wagon ten or twelve miles through the\ncountry, nothing pleas'd me more, in their homely beauty and novelty (I\nhad either never seen the little things to such advantage, or had\nnever noticed them before) than that peculiar fruit, with its profuse\nclear-yellow dangles of inch-long silk or yarn, in boundless profusion\nspotting the dark green cedar bushes--contrasting well with their bronze\ntufts--the flossy shreds covering the knobs all over, like a shock of\nwild hair on elfin pates. On my ramble afterward down by the creek I\npluck'd one from its bush, and shall keep it. These cedar-apples last\nonly a little while however, and soon crumble and fade.\n\n\nSUMMER SIGHTS AND INDOLENCIES\n\n_June 10th_.--As I write, 5-1/2 P.M., here by the creek, nothing can\nexceed the quiet splendor and freshness around me. We had a heavy\nshower, with brief thunder and lightning, in the middle of the day; and\nsince, overhead, one of those not uncommon yet indescribable skies\n(in quality, not details or forms) of limpid blue, with rolling\nsilver-fringed clouds, and a pure-dazzling sun. For underlay, trees\nin fulness of tender foliage--liquid, reedy, long-drawn notes of\nbirds--based by the fretful mewing of a querulous cat-bird, and the\npleasant chippering-shriek of two kingfishers. I have been watching the\nlatter the last half hour, on their regular evening frolic over and in\nthe stream; evidently a spree of the liveliest kind. They pursue each\nother, whirling and wheeling around, with many a jocund downward dip,\nsplashing the spray in jets of diamonds--and then off they swoop, with\nslanting wings and graceful flight, sometimes so near me I can plainly\nsee their dark-gray feather-bodies and milk-white necks.\n\n\nSUNDOWN PERFUME--QUAILNOTES--THE HERMIT-THRUSH\n\n_June 19th, 4 to 6-1/2, P.M._--Sitting alone by the creek--solitude\nhere, but the scene bright and vivid enough--the sun shining, and quite\na fresh wind blowing (some heavy showers last night,) the grass and\ntrees looking their best--the clare-obscure of different greens,\nshadows, half-shadows, and the dappling glimpses of the water, through\nrecesses--the wild flageolet-note of a quail near by--the just-heard\nfretting of some hylas down there in the pond--crows cawing in the\ndistance--a drove of young hogs rooting in soft ground near the oak\nunder which I sit--some come sniffing near me, and then scamper away,\nwith grunts. And still the clear notes of the quail--the quiver of\nleaf-shadows over the paper as I write--the sky aloft, with white\nclouds, and the sun well declining to the west--the swift darting\nof many sand-swallows coming and going, their holes in a neighboring\nmarl-bank--the odor of the cedar and oak, so palpable, as evening\napproaches--perfume, color, the bronze-and-gold of nearly ripen'd\nwheat--clover-fields, with honey-scent--the well-up maize, with long and\nrustling leaves--the great patches of thriving potatoes, dusky green,\nfleck'd all over with white blossoms--the old, warty, venerable oak\nabove me--and ever, mix'd with the dual notes of the quail, the soughing\nof the wind through some near-by pines.\n\nAs I rise for return, I linger long to a delicious song-epilogue (is\nit the hermit-thrush?) from some bushy recess off there in the swamp,\nrepeated leisurely and pensively over and over again. This, to the\ncircle-gambols of the swallows flying by dozens in concentric rings in\nthe last rays of sunset, like flashes of some airy wheel.\n\n\nA JULY AFTER-NOON BY THE POND\n\nThe fervent heat, but so much more endurable in this pure air--the\nwhite and pink pond-blossoms, with great heart-shaped leaves; the glassy\nwaters of the creek, the banks, with dense bushery, and the picturesque\nbeeches and shade and turf; the tremulous, reedy call of some bird\nfrom recesses, breaking the warm, indolent, half-voluptuous silence; an\noccasional wasp, hornet, honey-bee or bumble (they hover near my hands\nor face, yet annoy me not, nor I them, as they appear to examine, find\nnothing, and away they go)--the vast space of the sky overhead so clear,\nand the buzzard up there sailing his slow whirl in majestic spirals\nand discs; just over the surface of the pond, two large slate-color'd\ndragon-flies, with wings of lace, circling and darting and occasionally\nbalancing themselves quite still, their wings quivering all the time,\n(are they not showing off for my amusement?)--the pond itself, with\nthe sword-shaped calamus; the water snakes--occasionally a flitting\nblackbird, with red dabs on his shoulders, as he darts slantingly\nby--the sounds that bring out the solitude, warmth, light and shade--the\nquawk of some pond duck--(the crickets and grasshoppers are mute in\nthe noon heat, but I hear the song of the first cicadas;)--then at some\ndistance the rattle and whirr of a reaping machine as the horses draw\nit on a rapid walk through a rye field on the opposite side of the\ncreek--(what was the yellow or light-brown bird, large as a young hen,\nwith short neck and long-stretch'd legs I just saw, in flapping and\nawkward flight over there through the trees?)--the prevailing delicate,\nyet palpable, spicy, grassy, clovery perfume to my nostrils; and over\nall, encircling all, to my sight and soul, the free space of the\nsky, transparent and blue--and hovering there in the west, a mass of\nwhite-gray fleecy clouds the sailors call \"shoals of mackerel\"--the sky,\nwith silver swirls like locks of toss'd hair, spreading, expanding--a\nvast voiceless, formless simulacrum--yet may-be the most real reality\nand formulator of everything--who knows?\n\n\nLOCUSTS AND KATY-DIDS\n\n_Aug. 22_.--Reedy monotones of locust, or sounds of katydid--I hear the\nlatter at night, and the other both day and night. I thought the morning\nand evening warble of birds delightful; but I find I can listen to these\nstrange insects with just as much pleasure. A single locust is now heard\nnear noon from a tree two hundred feet off, as I write--a long whirring,\ncontinued, quite loud noise graded in distinct whirls, or swinging\ncircles, increasing in strength and rapidity up to a certain point, and\nthen a fluttering, quietly tapering fall. Each strain is continued\nfrom one to two minutes. The locust-song is very appropriate to the\nscene--gushes, has meaning, is masculine, is like some fine old wine,\nnot sweet, but far better than sweet.\n\nBut the katydid--how shall I describe its piquant utterances? One sings\nfrom a willow-tree just outside my open bedroom window, twenty yards\ndistant; every clear night for a fortnight past has sooth'd me to sleep.\nI rode through a piece of woods for a hundred rods the other evening,\nand heard the katydids by myriads--very curious for once; but I like\nbetter my single neighbor on the tree. Let me say more about the song of\nthe locust, even to repetition; a long, chromatic, tremulous crescendo,\nlike a brass disk whirling round and round, emitting wave after wave\nof notes, beginning with a certain moderate beat or measure, rapidly\nincreasing in speed and emphasis, reaching a point of great energy and\nsignificance, and then quickly and gracefully dropping down and out. Not\nthe melody of the singing-bird--far from it; the common musician might\nthink without melody, but surely having to the finer ear a harmony of\nits own; monotonous--but what a swing there is in that brassy drone,\nround and round, cymballine--or like the whirling of brass quoits.\n\n\nTHE LESSON OF A TREE\n\n_Sept. 1_.--I should not take either the biggest or the most picturesque\ntree to illustrate it. Here is one of my favorites now before me, a fine\nyellow poplar, quite straight, perhaps 90 feet high, and four thick\nat the butt. How strong, vital, enduring! how dumbly eloquent! What\nsuggestions of imperturbability and _being_, as against the human\ntrait of mere _seeming_. Then the qualities, almost emotional, palpably\nartistic, heroic, of a tree; so innocent and harmless, yet so savage. It\n_is_, yet says nothing. How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity\nall weathers, this gusty-temper'd little whiffet, man, that runs indoors\nat a mite of rain or snow. Science (or rather half-way science) scoffs\nat reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad, and of trees speaking. But,\nif they don't, they do as well as most speaking, writing, poetry,\nsermons--or rather they do a great deal better. I should say indeed that\nthose old dryad-reminiscences are quite as true as any, and profounder\nthan most reminiscences we get. (\"Cut this out,\" as the quack mediciners\nsay, and keep by you.) Go and sit in a grove or woods, with one or more\nof those voiceless companions, and read the foregoing, and think.\n\nOne lesson from affiliating a tree--perhaps the greatest moral lesson\nanyhow from earth, rocks, animals, is that same lesson of inherency, of\n_what is_, without the least regard to what the looker-on (the critic)\nsupposes or says, or whether he likes or dislikes. What worse--what more\ngeneral malady pervades each and all of us, our literature, education,\nattitude toward each other, (even toward ourselves,) than a morbid\ntrouble about _seems_, (generally temporarily seems too,) and no trouble\nat all, or hardly any, about the sane, slow-growing, perennial, real\nparts of character, books, friendship, marriage--humanity's invisible\nfoundations and hold-together? (As the all-basis, the nerve, the\ngreat-sympathetic, the plenum within humanity, giving stamp to\neverything, is necessarily invisible.)\n\n_Aug. 4, 6 P.M._--Lights and shades and rare effects on tree-foliage and\ngrass--transparent greens, grays, &c., all in sunset pomp and dazzle.\nThe clear beams are now thrown in many new places, on the quilted,\nseam'd, bronze-drab, lower tree-trunks, shadow'd except at this\nhour--now flooding their young and old columnar ruggedness with strong\nlight, unfolding to my sense new amazing features of silent, shaggy\ncharm, the solid bark, the expression of harmless impassiveness, with\nmany a bulge and gnarl unreck'd before. In the revealings of such light,\nsuch exceptional hour, such mood, one does not wonder at the old story\nfables, (indeed, why fables?) of people falling into love-sickness with\ntrees, seiz'd extatic with the mystic realism of the resistless silent\nstrength in them--_strength_, which after all is perhaps the last,\ncompletest, highest beauty.\n\n_Trees I am familiar with here_.\n\n   Oaks, (many kinds--one sturdy                       Willows.\n     old fellow, vital, green, bushy,                  Catalpas.\n     five feet thick at the butt, I sit                Persimmons.\n     under every day,)                                 Mountain-ash.\n   Cedars plenty.                                      Hickories.\n   Tulip trees, (_Liriodendron,_) is of                Maples, many kinds.\n     the magnolia family--I have                       Locusts.\n     seen it in Michigan and southern                  Birches.\n     Illinois, 140 feet high and                       Dogwood.\n     8 feet thick at the butt [A]; does                Pine.\n     not transplant well; best rais'd                  the Elm.\n     from seeds--(the lumbermen                        Chesnut.\n     call it yellow poplar.)                           Linden.\n   Sycamores.                                          Aspen.\n   Gum trees, both sweet and sour.                     Spruce.\n   Beeches.                                            Hornbeam.\n   Black-walnuts.                                      Laurel.\n   Sassafras.                                          Holly.\n\n\nAUTUMN SIDE-BITS\n\n_Sept. 20_.--Under an old black oak, glossy and green, exhaling\naroma--amid a grove the Albic druids might have chosen--envelop'd in\nthe warmth and light of the noonday sun, and swarms[10] of flitting\ninsects--with the harsh cawing of many crows a hundred rods away--here\nI sit in solitude, absorbing, enjoying all. The corn, stack'd in its\ncone-shaped stacks, russet-color'd and sere--a large field spotted thick\nwith scarlet-gold pumpkins--an adjoining one of cabbages, showing\nwell in their green and pearl, mottled by much light and shade--melon\npatches, with their bulging ovals, and great silver-streak'd, ruffled,\nbroad-edged leaves--and many an autumn sight and sound beside--the\ndistant scream of a flock of guinea-hens--and pour'd over all the\nSeptember breeze, with pensive cadence through the tree tops.\n\n_Another Day_.--The ground in all directions strew'd with _debris_ from\na storm. Timber creek, as I slowly pace its banks, has ebb'd low, and\nshows reaction from the turbulent swell of the late equinoctial. As I\nlook around, I take account of stock--weeds and shrubs, knolls, paths,\noccasional stumps, some with smooth'd tops, (several I use as seats\nof rest, from place to place, and from one I am now jotting these\nlines,)--frequent wild-flowers, little white, star-shaped things, or the\ncardinal red of the lobelia, or the cherry-ball seeds of the perennial\nrose, or the many-threaded vines winding up and around trunks of trees.\n\n_Oct. 1, 2 and 3_.--Down every day in the solitude of the creek. A\nserene autumn sun and westerly breeze to-day (3d) as I sit here, the\nwater surface prettily moving in wind-ripples before me. On a stout old\nbeech at the edge, decayed and slanting, almost fallen to the stream,\nyet with life and leaves in its mossy limbs, a gray squirrel, exploring,\nruns up and down, flirts his tail, leaps to the ground, sits on his\nhaunches upright as he sees me, (a Darwinian hint?) and then races up\nthe tree again.\n\n_Oct. 4_.--Cloudy and coolish; signs of incipient winter. Yet pleasant\nhere, the leaves thick-falling, the ground brown with them already; rich\ncoloring, yellows of all hues, pale and dark-green, shades from lightest\nto richest red--all set in and toned down by the prevailing brown of\nthe earth and gray of the sky. So, winter is coming; and I yet in my\nsickness. I sit here amid all these fair sights and vital influences,\nand abandon myself to that thought, with its wandering trains of\nspeculation.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[10] There is a tulip poplar within sight of Woodstown, which is twenty\nfeet around, three feet from the ground, four feet across about eighteen\nfeet up the trunk, which is broken off about three or four feet higher\nup. On the south side an arm has shot out from which rise two stems,\neach to about ninety-one or ninety-two feet from the ground. Twenty-five\n(or more) years since the cavity in the butt was large enough for,\nand nine men at one time, ate dinner therein. It is supposed twelve to\nfifteen men could now, at one time, stand within its trunk. The severe\nwinds of 1877 and 1878 did not seem to damage it, and the two stems send\nout yearly many blossoms, scenting the air immediately about it with\ntheir sweet perfume. It is entirely unprotected by other trees, on a\nhill.--_Woodstown, N. J., \"Register,\" April 15, '79_.\n\n\nTHE SKY--DAYS AND NIGHTS--HAPPINESS\n\n_Oct. 20_.--A clear, crispy day--dry and breezy air, full of oxygen.\nOut of the sane, silent, beauteous miracles that envelope and fuse\nme--trees, water, grass, sunlight, and early frost--the one I am looking\nat most to-day is the sky. It has that delicate, transparent blue,\npeculiar to autumn, and the only clouds are little or larger white\nones, giving their still and spiritual motion to the great concave. All\nthrough the earlier day (say from 7 to 11) it keeps a pure, yet vivid\nblue. But as noon approaches the color gets lighter, quite gray for two\nor three hours--then still paler for a spell, till sun-down--which last\nI watch dazzling through the interstices of a knoll of big trees--darts\nof fire and a gorgeous show of light-yellow, liver-color and red, with a\nvast silver glaze askant on the water--the transparent shadows, shafts,\nsparkle, and vivid colors beyond all the paintings ever made.\n\nI don't know what or how, but it seems to me mostly owing to these\nskies, (every now and then I think, while I have of course seen them\nevery day of my life, I never really saw the skies before,) have had\nthis autumn some wondrously contented hours--may I not say perfectly\nhappy ones? As I have read, Byron just before his death told a friend\nthat he had known but three happy hours during his whole existence. Then\nthere is the old German legend of the king's bell, to the same point.\nWhile I was out there by the wood, that beautiful sunset through the\ntrees, I thought of Byron's and the bell story, and the notion started\nin me that I was having a happy hour. (Though perhaps my best moments\nI never jot down; when they come I cannot afford to break the charm by\ninditing memoranda. I just abandon myself to the mood, and let it float\non, carrying me in its placid extasy.)\n\nWhat is happiness, anyhow? Is this one of its hours, or the like\nof it?--so impalpable--a mere breath, an evanescent tinge? I am not\nsure--so let me give myself the benefit of the doubt. Hast Thou,\npellucid, in Thy azure depths, medicine for case like mine? (Ah, the\nphysical shatter and troubled spirit of me the last three years.) And\ndost Thou subtly mystically now drip it through the air invisibly upon\nme?\n\n_Night of Oct. 28._--The heavens unusually transparent--the stars out by\nmyriads--the great path of the Milky Way, with its branch, only seen\nof very clear nights--Jupiter, setting in the west, looks like a huge\nhap-hazard splash, and has a little star for companion.\n\n    Clothed in his white garments,\n    Into the round and clear arena slowly entered the brahmin,\n    Holding a little child by the hand,\n    Like the moon with the planet Jupiter in a cloudless night-sky.\n\n    _Old Hindu Poem._\n\n_Early in November._--At its farther end the lane already described\nopens into a broad grassy upland field of over twenty acres, slightly\nsloping to the south. Here I am accustom'd to walk for sky views and\neffects, either morning or sundown. To-day from this field my soul is\ncalm'd and expanded beyond description, the whole forenoon by the clear\nblue arching over all, cloudless, nothing particular, only sky and\ndaylight. Their soothing accompaniments, autumn leaves, the cool dry\nair, the faint aroma--crows cawing in the distance--two great buzzards\nwheeling gracefully and slowly far up there--the occasional murmur of\nthe wind, sometimes quite gently, then threatening through the trees--a\ngang of farm-laborers loading cornstalks in a field in sight, and the\npatient horses waiting.\n\n\nCOLORS--A CONTRAST\n\nSuch a play of colors and lights, different seasons, different hours of\nthe day--the lines of the far horizon where the faint-tinged edge of the\nlandscape loses itself in the sky. As I slowly hobble up the lane toward\nday-close, an incomparable sunset shooting in molten sapphire and gold,\nshaft after shaft, through the ranks of the long-leaved corn, between me\nand the west. _Another day_--The rich dark green of the tulip-trees and\nthe oaks, the gray of the swamp-willows, the dull hues of the sycamores\nand black-walnuts, the emerald of the cedars (after rain,) and the light\nyellow of the beeches.\n\n\nNOVEMBER 8, '76\n\nThe forenoon leaden and cloudy, not cold or wet, but indicating both.\nAs I hobble down here and sit by the silent pond, how different from the\nexcitement amid which, in the cities, millions of people are now waiting\nnews of yesterday's Presidential election, or receiving and discussing\nthe result--in this secluded place uncared-for, unknown.\n\n\nCROWS AND CROWS\n\n_Nov. 14_.--As I sit here by the creek, resting after my walk, a warm\nlanguor bathes me from the sun. No sound but a cawing of crows, and no\nmotion but their black flying figures from over-head, reflected in the\nmirror of the pond below. Indeed a principal feature of the scene to-day\nis these crows, their incessant cawing, far or near, and their countless\nflocks and processions moving from place to place, and at times almost\ndarkening the air with their myriads. As I sit a moment writing this\nby the bank, I see the black, clear-cut reflection of them far below,\nflying through the watery looking-glass, by ones, twos, or long\nstrings. All last night I heard the noises from their great roost in a\nneighboring wood.\n\n\nA WINTER DAY ON THE SEA-BEACH\n\nOne bright December mid-day lately I spent down on the New Jersey\nsea-shore, reaching it by a little more than an hour's railroad trip\nover the old Camden and Atlantic. I had started betimes, fortified by\nnice strong coffee and a good breakfast (cook'd by the hands I love, my\ndear sister Lou's--how much better it makes the victuals taste, and\nthen assimilate, strengthen you, perhaps make the whole day comfortable\nafterwards.) Five or six miles at the last, our track enter'd a broad\nregion of salt grass meadows, intersected by lagoons, and cut up\neverywhere by watery runs. The sedgy perfume, delightful to my nostrils,\nreminded me of \"the mash\" and south bay of my native island. I could\nhave journey'd contentedly till night through these flat and odorous\nsea-prairies. From half-past 11 till 2 I was nearly all the time along\nthe beach, or in sight of the ocean, listening to its hoarse murmur, and\ninhaling the bracing and welcome breezes. First, a rapid five-mile drive\nover the hard sand--our carriage wheels hardly made dents in it. Then\nafter dinner (as there were nearly two hours to spare) I walk'd off in\nanother direction, (hardly met or saw a person,) and taking possession\nof what appear'd to have been the reception-room of an old bath-house\nrange, had a broad expanse of view all to myself--quaint, refreshing,\nunimpeded--a dry area of sedge and Indian grass immediately before and\naround me--space, simple, unornamented space. Distant vessels, and the\nfar-off, just visible trailing smoke of an inward bound steamer; more\nplainly, ships, brigs, schooners, in sight, most of them with every sail\nset to the firm and steady wind.\n\nThe attractions, fascinations there are in sea and shore! How one dwells\non their simplicity, even vacuity! What is it in us, arous'd by those\nindirections and directions? That spread of waves and gray-white beach,\nsalt, monotonous, senseless--such an entire absence of art, books, talk,\nelegance--so indescribably comforting, even this winter day--grim,\nyet so delicate-looking, so spiritual--striking emotional, impalpable\ndepths, subtler than all the poems, paintings, music, I have ever read,\nseen, heard. (Yet let me be fair, perhaps it is because I have read\nthose poems and heard that music.)\n\n\nSEA-SHORE FANCIES\n\nEven as a boy, I had the fancy, the wish, to write a piece, perhaps\na poem, about the sea-shore--that suggesting, dividing line, contact,\njunction, the solid marrying the liquid--that curious, lurking\nsomething, (as doubtless every objective form finally becomes to the\nsubjective spirit,) which means far more than its mere first sight,\ngrand as that is--blending the real and ideal, and each made portion\nof the other. Hours, days, in my Long Island youth and early manhood,\nI haunted the shores of Rockaway or Coney island, or away east to the\nHamptons or Montauk. Once, at the latter place, (by the old lighthouse,\nnothing but sea-tossings in sight in every direction as far as the eye\ncould reach,) I remember well, I felt that I must one day write a book\nexpressing this liquid, mystic theme. Afterward, I recollect, how it\ncame to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary\nattempt, the sea-shore should be an invisible _influence_, a pervading\ngauge and tally for me, in my composition. (Let me give a hint here to\nyoung writers. I am not sure but I have unwittingly follow'd out the\nsame rule with other powers besides sea and shores--avoiding them,\nin the way of any dead set at poetizing them, as too big for formal\nhandling--quite satisfied if I could indirectly show that we have met\nand fused, even if only once, but enough--that we have really absorb'd\neach other and understand each other.)\n\nThere is a dream, a picture, that for years at intervals, (sometimes\nquite long ones, but surely again, in time,) has come noiselessly up\nbefore me, and I really believe, fiction as it is, has enter'd largely\ninto my practical life--certainly into my writings, and shaped and\ncolor'd them. It is nothing more or less than a stretch of interminable\nwhite-brown sand, hard and smooth and broad, with the ocean perpetually,\ngrandly, rolling in upon it, with slow-measured sweep, with rustle and\nhiss and foam, and many a thump as of low bass drums. This scene, this\npicture, I say, has risen before me at times for years. Sometimes I wake\nat night and can hear and see it plainly.\n\n\nIN MEMORY OF THOMAS PAINE.\n\n_Spoken at Lincoln Hall, Philadelphia, Sunday, Jan. 28, '77, for 140th\nanniversary of T. P.'s birthday._\n\nSome thirty-five years ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of\nwhich place I was then a frequenter, I happen'd to become quite well\nacquainted with Thomas Paine's perhaps most intimate chum, and certainly\nhis later years' very frequent companion, a remarkably fine old man,\nCol. Fellows, who may yet be remember'd by some stray relics of that\nperiod and spot. If you will allow me, I will first give a description\nof the Colonel himself. He was tall, of military bearing, aged about 78,\nI should think, hair white as snow, clean-shaved on the face, dress'd\nvery neatly, a tail-coat of blue cloth with metal buttons, buff vest,\npantaloons of drab color, and his neck, breast and wrists showing the\nwhitest of linen. Under all circumstances, fine manners; a good but not\nprofuse talker, his wits still fully about him, balanced and live\nand undimm'd as ever. He kept pretty fair health, though so old. For\nemployment--for he was poor--he had a post as constable of some of the\nupper courts. I used to think him very picturesque on the fringe of a\ncrowd holding a tall staff, with his erect form, and his superb, bare,\nthick-hair'd, closely-cropt white head. The judges and young lawyers,\nwith whom he was ever a favorite, and the subject of respect, used to\ncall him Aristides. It was the general opinion among them that if manly\nrectitude and the instincts of absolute justice remain'd vital anywhere\nabout New York City Hall, or Tammany, they were to be found in Col.\nFellows. He liked young men, and enjoy'd to leisurely talk with them\nover a social glass of toddy, after his day's work, (he on these\noccasions never drank but one glass,) and it was at reiterated meetings\nof this kind in old Tammany's back parlor of those days, that he told\nme much about Thomas Paine. At one of our interviews he gave me a minute\naccount of Paine's sickness and death. In short, from those talks, I\nwas and am satisfied that my old friend, with his mark'd advantages, had\nmentally, morally and emotionally gauged the author of \"Common Sense,\"\nand besides giving me a good portrait of his appearance and manners, had\ntaken the true measure of his interior character.\n\nPaine's practical demeanor, and much of his theoretical belief, was a\nmixture of the French and English schools of a century ago, and the best\nof both. Like most old-fashion'd people, he drank a glass or two every\nday, but was no tippler, nor intemperate, let alone being a drunkard.\nHe lived simply and economically, but quite well--was always cheery and\ncourteous, perhaps occasionally a little blunt, having very positive\nopinions upon politics, religion, and so forth. That he labor'd well and\nwisely for the States in the trying period of their parturition, and in\nthe seeds of their character, there seems to me no question. I dare\nnot say how much of what our Union is owning and enjoying to-day--its\nindependence--its ardent belief in, and substantial practice of\nradical human rights--and the severance of its government from all\necclesiastical and superstitious dominion--I dare not say how much of\nall this is owing to Thomas Paine, but I am inclined to think a good\nportion of it decidedly is.\n\nBut I was not going either into an analysis or eulogium of the man.\nI wanted to carry you back a generation or two, and give you by\nindirection a moment's glance--and also to ventilate a very earnest and\nI believe authentic opinion, nay conviction, of that time, the fruit\nof the interviews I have mention'd, and of questioning and\ncross-questioning, clench'd by my best information since, that Thomas\nPaine had a noble personality, as exhibited in presence, face, voice,\ndress, manner, and what may be call'd his atmosphere and magnetism,\nespecially the later years of his life. I am sure of it. Of the foul and\nfoolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his decease, the\nabsolute fact is that as he lived a good life, after its kind, he died\ncalmly and philosophically, as became him. He served the embryo Union\nwith most precious service--a service that every man, woman and child\nin our thirty-eight States is to some extent receiving the benefit of\nto-day--and I for one here cheerfully, reverently throw my pebble on the\ncairn of his memory. As we all know, the season demands--or rather, will\nit ever be out of season?--that America learn to better dwell on her\nchoicest possession, the legacy of her good and faithful men--that she\nwell preserve their fame, if unquestion'd--or, if need be, that she fail\nnot to dissipate what clouds have intruded on that fame, and burnish it\nnewer, truer and brighter, continually.\n\n\nA TWO HOURS ICE-SAIL\n\n_Feb. 3, '77_--From 4 to 6 P. M. crossing the Delaware, (back again at\nmy Camden home,) unable to make our landing, through the ice; our boat\nstanch and strong and skilfully piloted, but old and sulky, and poorly\nminding her helm. (_Power_, so important in poetry and war, is also\nfirst point of all in a winter steamboat, with long stretches of\nice-packs to tackle.) For over two hours we bump'd and beat about,\nthe invisible ebb, sluggish but irresistible, often carrying us long\ndistances against our will. In the first tinge of dusk, as I look'd\naround, I thought there could not be presented a more chilling, arctic,\ngrim-extended, depressing scene. Everything was yet plainly visible; for\nmiles north and south, ice, ice, ice, mostly broken, but some big\ncakes, and no clear water in sight. The shores, piers, surfaces,\nroofs, shipping, mantled with snow. A faint winter vapor hung a fitting\naccompaniment around and over the endless whitish spread, and gave it\njust a tinge of steel and brown.\n\n_Feb. 6_.--As I cross home in the 6 P. M. boat again, the transparent\nshadows are filled everywhere with leisurely falling, slightly slanting,\ncuriously sparse but very large, flakes of snow. On the shores, near and\nfar, the glow of just-lit gas-clusters at intervals. The ice, sometimes\nin hummocks, sometimes floating fields, through which our boat goes\ncrunching. The light permeated by that peculiar evening haze, right\nafter sunset, which sometimes renders quite distant objects so\ndistinctly.\n\n\nSPRING OVERTURES--RECREATIONS\n\n_Feb. 10_.--The first chirping, almost singing, of a bird to-day. Then\nI noticed a couple of honey-bees spirting and humming about the open\nwindow in the sun.\n\n_Feb. 11_.--In the soft rose and pale gold of the declining light, this\nbeautiful evening, I heard the first hum and preparation of awakening\nspring--very faint--whether in the earth or roots, or starting of\ninsects, I know not--but it was audible, as I lean'd on a rail (I am\ndown in my country quarters awhile,) and look'd long at the western\nhorizon. Turning to the east, Sirius, as the shadows deepen'd, came\nforth in dazzling splendor. And great Orion; and a little to the\nnorth-east the big Dipper, standing on end.\n\n_Feb. 20_.--A solitary and pleasant sundown hour at the pond, exercising\narms, chest, my whole body, by a tough oak sapling thick as my wrist,\ntwelve feet high--pulling and pushing, inspiring the good air. After\nI wrestle with the tree awhile, I can feel its young sap and virtue\nwelling up out of the ground and tingling through me from crown to toe,\nlike health's wine. Then for addition and variety I launch forth in my\nvocalism; shout declamatory pieces, sentiments, sorrow, anger, &c., from\nthe stock poets or plays--or inflate my lungs and sing the wild tunes\nand refrains I heard of the blacks down south, or patriotic songs I\nlearn'd in the army. I make the echoes ring, I tell you! As the twilight\nfell, in a pause of these ebullitions, an owl somewhere the other side\nof the creek sounded _too-oo-oo-oo-oo_, soft and pensive (and I fancied\na little sarcastic) repeated four or five times. Either to applaud the\nnegro songs--or perhaps an ironical comment on the sorrow, anger, or\nstyle of the stock poets.\n\n\nONE OF THE HUMAN KINKS\n\nHow is it that in all the serenity and lonesomeness of solitude, away\noff here amid the hush of the forest, alone, or as I have found in\nprairie wilds, or mountain stillness, one is never entirely without the\ninstinct of looking around, (I never am, and others tell me the same of\nthemselves, confidentially,) for somebody to appear, or start up out\nof the earth, or from behind some tree or rock? Is it a lingering,\ninherited remains of man's primitive wariness, from the wild animals? or\nfrom his savage ancestry far back? It is not at all nervousness or fear.\nSeems as if something unknown were possibly lurking in those bushes, or\nsolitary places. Nay, it is quite certain there is--some vital unseen\npresence.\n\n\nAN AFTERNOON SCENE\n\n_Feb. 22_.--Last night and to-day rainy and thick, till mid-afternoon,\nwhen the wind chopp'd round, the clouds swiftly drew off like curtains,\nthe clear appear'd, and with it the fairest, grandest, most wondrous\nrainbow I ever saw, all complete, very vivid at its earth-ends,\nspreading vast effusions of illuminated haze, violet, yellow,\ndrab-green, in all directions overhead, through which the sun beam'd--an\nindescribable utterance of color and light, so gorgeous yet so soft,\nsuch as I had never witness'd before. Then its continuance: a full hour\npass'd before the last of those earth-ends disappear'd. The sky behind\nwas all spread in translucent blue, with many little white clouds and\nedges. To these a sunset, filling, dominating the esthetic and soul\nsenses, sumptuously, tenderly, full. I end this note by the pond,\njust light enough to see, through the evening shadows, the western\nreflections in its water-mirror surface, with inverted figures of trees.\nI hear now and then the _flup_ of a pike leaping out, and rippling the\nwater.\n\n\nTHE GATES OPENING\n\n_April 6_.--Palpable spring indeed, or the indications of it. I am\nsitting in bright sunshine, at the edge of the creek, the surface just\nrippled by the wind. All is solitude, morning freshness, negligence.\nFor companions my two kingfishers sailing, winding, darting, dipping,\nsometimes capriciously separate, then flying together. I hear their\nguttural twittering again and again; for awhile nothing but that\npeculiar sound. As noon approaches other birds warm up. The reedy notes\nof the robin, and a musical passage of two parts, one a clear delicious\ngurgle, with several other birds I cannot place. To which is join'd,\n(yes, I just hear it,) one low purr at intervals from some impatient\nhylas at the pond-edge. The sibilant murmur of a pretty stiff breeze\nnow and then through the trees. Then a poor little dead leaf, long\nfrost-bound, whirls from somewhere up aloft in one wild escaped\nfreedom-spree in space and sunlight, and then dashes down to the waters,\nwhich hold it closely and soon drown it out of sight. The bushes and\ntrees are yet bare, but the beeches have their wrinkled yellow leaves of\nlast season's foliage largely left, frequent cedars and pines yet green,\nand the grass not without proofs of coming fullness. And over all a\nwonderfully fine dome of clear blue, the play of light coming and going,\nand great fleeces of white clouds swimming so silently.\n\n\nTHE COMMON EARTH, THE SOIL\n\nThe soil, too--let others pen-and-ink the sea, the air, (as I sometimes\ntry)--but now I feel to choose the common soil for theme--naught else.\nThe brown soil here, (just between winter-close and opening spring\nand vegetation)--the rain-shower at night, and the fresh smell next\nmorning--the red worms wriggling out of the ground--the dead leaves,\nthe incipient grass, and the latent life underneath--the effort to start\nsomething--already in shelter'd spots some little flowers--the distant\nemerald show of winter wheat and the rye-fields--the yet naked trees,\nwith clear insterstices, giving prospects hidden in summer--the tough\nfallow and the plow-team, and the stout boy whistling to his horses for\nencouragement--and there the dark fat earth in long slanting stripes\nupturn'd.\n\n\nBIRDS AND BIRDS AND BIRDS\n\n_A little later--bright weather_.--An unusual melodiousness, these days,\n(last of April and first of May) from the blackbirds; indeed all sorts\nof birds, darting, whistling, hopping or perch'd on trees. Never before\nhave I seen, heard, or been in the midst of, and got so flooded and\nsaturated with them and their performances, as this current month. Such\noceans, such successions of them. Let me make a list of those I find\nhere:\n\nBlack birds (plenty,) Meadow-larks (plenty,) Ring doves, Cat-birds\n(plenty,) Owls, Cuckoos, Woodpeckers, Pond snipes (plenty,) King-birds,\nCheewinks, Crows (plenty,) Quawks, Wrens, Ground robins, Kingfishers,\nRavens, Quails, Gray snipes, Turkey-buzzards, Eagles, Hen-hawks,\nHigh-holes, Yellow birds, Herons, Thrushes, Tits, Reed birds,\nWoodpigeons.\n\nEarly came the\n\nBlue birds, Meadow-lark, Killdeer, White-bellied swallow, Plover,\nSandpiper, Robin, Wilson's thrush, Woodcock, Flicker.\n\n\nFULL-STARR'D NIGHTS\n\n_May 2l_.--Back in Camden. Again commencing one of those unusually\ntransparent, full-starr'd, blue-black nights, as if to show that however\nlush and pompous the day may be, there is something left in the\nnot-day that can outvie it. The rarest, finest sample of long-drawn-out\nclear-obscure, from sundown to 9 o'clock. I went down to the Delaware,\nand cross'd and cross'd. Venus like blazing silver well up in the west.\nThe large pale thin crescent of the new moon, half an hour high, sinking\nlanguidly under a bar-sinister of cloud, and then emerging. Arcturus\nright overhead. A faint fragrant sea-odor wafted up from the south.\nThe gloaming, the temper'd coolness, with every feature of the scene,\nindescribably soothing and tonic--one of those hours that give hints to\nthe soul, impossible to put in a statement. (Ah, where would be any food\nfor spirituality without night and the stars?) The vacant spaciousness\nof the air, and the veil'd blue of the heavens, seem'd miracles enough.\n\nAs the night advanc'd it changed its spirit and garments to ampler\nstateliness. I was almost conscious of a definite presence, Nature\nsilently near. The great constellation of the Water-Serpent stretch'd\nits coils over more than half the heavens. The Swan with outspread wings\nwas flying down the Milky Way. The northern Crown, the Eagle, Lyra, all\nup there in their places. From the whole dome shot down points of light,\nrapport with me, through the clear blue-black. All the usual sense of\nmotion, all animal life, seem'd discarded, seem'd a fiction; a curious\npower, like the placid rest of Egyptian gods, took possession, none\nthe less potent for being impalpable. Earlier I had seen many bats,\nbalancing in the luminous twilight, darting their black forms hither\nand yon over the river; but now they altogether disappear'd. The evening\nstar and the moon had gone. Alertness and peace lay camly couching\ntogether through the fluid universal shadows.\n\n_Aug. 26_.--Bright has the day been, and my spirits an equal _forzando_.\nThen comes the night, different, inexpressibly pensive, with its\nown tender and temper'd splendor. Venus lingers in the west with a\nvoluptuous dazzle unshown hitherto this summer. Mars rises early, and\nthe red sulky moon, two days past her full; Jupiter at night's meridian,\nand the long curling-slanted Scorpion stretching full view in the south,\nAretus-neck'd. Mars walks the heavens lord-paramount now; all through\nthis month I go out after supper and watch for him; sometimes getting\nup at midnight to take another look at his unparallel'd lustre. (I see\nlately an astronomer has made out through the new Washington telescope\nthat Mars has certainly one moon, perhaps two.) Pale and distant, but\nnear in the heavens, Saturn precedes him.\n\n\nMULLEINS AND MULLEINS\n\nLarge, placid mulleins, as summer advances, velvety in texture, of a\nlight greenish-drab color, growing everywhere in the fields--at first\nearth's big rosettes in their broad-leav'd low cluster-plants, eight,\nten, twenty leaves to a plant--plentiful on the fallow twenty-acre\nlot, at the end of the lane, and especially by the ridge-sides of the\nfences--then close to the ground, but soon springing up--leaves as broad\nas my hand, and the lower ones twice as long--so fresh and dewy in the\nmorning--stalks now four or five, even seven or eight feet high. The\nfarmers, I find, think the mullein a mean unworthy weed, but I have\ngrown to a fondness for it. Every object has its lesson, enclosing\nthe suggestion of everything else--and lately I sometimes think all is\nconcentrated for me in these hardy, yellow-flower'd weeds. As I come\ndown the lane early in the morning, I pause before their soft wool-like\nfleece and stem and broad leaves, glittering with countless diamonds.\nAnnually for three summers now, they and I have silently return'd\ntogether; at such long intervals I stand or sit among them,\nmusing--and woven with the rest, of so many hours and moods of partial\nrehabilitation--of my sane or sick spirit, here as near at peace as it\ncan be.\n\n\nDISTANT SOUNDS\n\nThe axe of the wood-cutter, the measured thud of a single\nthreshing-flail, the crowing of chanticleer in the barn-yard, (with\ninvariable responses from other barn-yards,) and the lowing of\ncattle--but most of all, or far or near, the wind--through the high\ntree-tops, or through low bushes, laving one's face and hands so gently,\nthis balmy-bright noon, the coolest for a long time, (Sept. 2)--I will\nnot call it _sighing_, for to me it is always a firm, sane, cheery\nexpression, through a monotone, giving many varieties, or swift or slow,\nor dense or delicate. The wind in the patch of pine woods off there--how\nsibilant. Or at sea, I can imagine it this moment, tossing the waves,\nwith spirits of foam flying far, and the free whistle, and the scent\nof the salt--and that vast paradox somehow with all its action and\nrestlessness conveying a sense of eternal rest.\n\n_Other adjuncts._--But the sun and the moon here and these times. As\nnever more wonderful by day, the gorgeous orb imperial, so vast,\nso ardently, lovingly hot--so never a more glorious moon of nights,\nespecially the last three or four. The great planets too--Mars never\nbefore so flaming bright, so flashing-large, with slight yellow tinge,\n(the astronomers say--is it true?--nearer to us than any time the past\ncentury)--and well up, lord Jupiter, (a little while since close by\nthe moon)--and in the west, after the sun sinks, voluptuous Venus, now\nlanguid and shorn of her beams, as if from some divine excess.\n\n\nA SUN-BATH-NAKEDNESS\n\n_Sunday, Aug. 27_.--Another day quite free from mark'd prostration\nand pain. It seems indeed as if peace and nutriment from heaven subtly\nfilter into me as I slowly hobble down these country lanes and across\nfields, in the good air--as I sit here in solitude with Nature--open,\nvoiceless, mystic, far removed, yet palpable, eloquent Nature. I\nmerge myself in the scene, in the perfect day. Hovering over the clear\nbrook-water, I am sooth'd by its soft gurgle in one place, and\nthe hoarser murmurs of its three-foot fall in another. Come, ye\ndisconsolate, in whom any latent eligibility is left--come get the sure\nvirtues of creek-shore, and wood and field. Two months (July and August,\n'77,) have I absorb'd them, and they begin to make a new man of me.\nEvery day, seclusion--every day at least two or three hours of freedom,\nbathing, no talk, no bonds, no dress, no books, no _manners_.\n\nShall I tell you, reader, to what I attribute my already much-restored\nhealth? That I have been almost two years, off and on, without drugs and\nmedicines, and daily in the open air. Last summer I found a particularly\nsecluded little dell off one side by my creek, originally a large\ndug-out marl-pit, now abandon'd, fill'd, with bushes, trees, grass, a\ngroup of willows, a straggling bank, and a spring of delicious water\nrunning right through the middle of it, with two or three little\ncascades. Here I retreated every hot day, and follow it up this summer.\nHere I realize the meaning of that old fellow who said he was seldom\nless alone than when alone. Never before did I get so close to Nature;\nnever before did she come so close to me. By old habit, I pencill'd down\nfrom time to time, almost automatically, moods, sights, hours, tints and\noutlines, on the spot. Let me specially record the satisfaction of\nthis current forenoon, so serene and primitive, so conventionally\nexceptional, natural.\n\nAn hour or so after breakfast I wended my way down to the recesses of\nthe aforesaid dell, which I and certain thrushes, cat-birds, &c.,\nhad all to ourselves. A light south-west wind was blowing through the\ntree-tops. It was just the place and time for my Adamic air-bath and\nflesh-brushing from head to foot. So hanging clothes on a rail near by,\nkeeping old broadbrim straw on head and easy shoes on feet, havn't I had\na good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles\nrasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn'd scarlet--then partially\nbathing in the clear waters of the running brook--taking everything very\nleisurely, with many rests and pauses--stepping about barefooted every\nfew minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous\nmud-bath to my feet--a brief second and third rinsing in the crystal\nrunning waters--rubbing with the fragrant towel--slow negligent\npromenades on the turf up and down in the sun, varied with occasional\nrests, and further frictions of the bristle-brush--sometimes carrying\nmy portable chair with me from place to place, as my range is quite\nextensive here, nearly a hundred rods, feeling quite secure from\nintrusion, (and that indeed I am not at all nervous about, if it\naccidentally happens.)\n\nAs I walk'd slowly over the grass, the sun shone out enough to show the\nshadow moving with me. Somehow I seem'd to get identity with each and\nevery thing around me, in its condition. Nature was naked, and I was\nalso. It was too lazy, soothing, and joyous-equable to speculate\nabout. Yet I might have thought somehow in this vein: Perhaps the inner\nnever-lost rapport we hold with earth, light, air, trees, &c., is not to\nbe realized through eyes and mind only, but through the whole corporeal\nbody, which I will not have blinded or bandaged any more than the eyes.\nSweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature!--ah if poor, sick, prurient\nhumanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness\nthen indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your\nsophistication, your tear, your respectability, that is indecent. There\ncome moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear,\nbut are themselves indecent. Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free\nexhilarating extasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible (and\nhow many thousands there are!) has not really known what purity is--nor\nwhat faith or art or health really is. (Probably the whole curriculum\nof first-class philosophy, beauty, heroism, form, illustrated by the\nold Hellenic race--the highest height and deepest depth known to\ncivilization in those departments--came from their natural and religious\nidea of Nakedness.)\n\nMany such hours, from time to time, the last two summers--I attribute my\npartial rehabilitation largely to them. Some good people may think it a\nfeeble or half-crack'd way of spending one's time and thinking. May-be\nit is.\n\n\nTHE OAKS AND I\n\n_Sept. 5, '77._--I write this, 11 A.M., shelter'd under a dense oak\nby the bank, where I have taken refuge from a sudden rain. I came down\nhere, (we had sulky drizzles all the morning, but an hour ago a lull,)\nfor the before-mention'd daily and simple exercise I am fond of--to\npull on that young hickory sapling out there--to sway and yield to its\ntough-limber upright stem--haply to get into my old sinews some of\nits elastic fibre and clear sap. I stand on the turf and take these\nhealth-pulls moderately and at intervals for nearly an hour, inhaling\ngreat draughts of fresh air. Wandering by the creek, I have three or\nfour naturally favorable spots where I rest--besides a chair I lug with\nme and use for more deliberate occasions. At other spots convenient I\nhave selected, besides the hickory just named, strong and limber boughs\nof beech or holly, in easy-reaching distance, for my natural gymnasia,\nfor arms, chest, trunk-muscles. I can soon feel the sap and sinew rising\nthrough me, like mercury to heat. I hold on boughs or slender trees\ncaressingly there in the sun and shade, wrestle with their innocent\nstalwartness--and _know_ the virtue thereof passes from them into me.\n(Or may-be we interchange--may-be the trees are more aware of it all\nthan I ever thought.)\n\nBut now pleasantly imprison'd here under the big oak--the rain dripping,\nand the sky cover'd with leaden clouds--nothing but the pond on one\nside, and the other a spread of grass, spotted with the milky blossoms\nof the wild carrot--the sound of an axe wielded at some distant\nwood-pile--yet in this dull scene, (as most folks would call it,) why am\nI so (almost) happy here and alone? Why would any intrusion, even from\npeople I like, spoil the charm? But am I alone? Doubtless there comes a\ntime--perhaps it has come to me--when one feels through his whole being,\nand pronouncedly the emotional part, that identity between himself\nsubjectively and Nature objectively which Schelling and Fichte are so\nfond of pressing. How it is I know not, but I often realize a presence\nhere--in clear moods I am certain of it, and neither chemistry nor\nreasoning nor esthetics will give the least explanation. All the past\ntwo summers it has been strengthening and nourishing my sick body and\nsoul, as never before. Thanks, invisible physician, for thy silent\ndelicious medicine, thy day and night, thy waters and thy airs, the\nbanks, the grass, the trees, and e'en the weeds!\n\n\nA QUINTETTE\n\nWhile I have been kept by the rain under the shelter of my great oak,\n(perfectly dry and comfortable, to the rattle of the drops all around,)\nI have pencill'd off the mood of the hour in a little quintette, which I\nwill give you:\n\n    At vacancy with Nature,\n    Acceptive and at ease,\n    Distilling the present hour,\n    Whatever, wherever it is,\n    And over the past, oblivion.\n\nCan you get hold of it, reader dear? and how do you like it anyhow?\n\n\nTHE FIRST FROST--MEMS\n\nWhere I was stopping I saw the first palpable frost, on my sunrise walk,\nOctober 6; all over the yet-green spread a light blue-gray veil, giving\na new show to the entire landscape. I had but little time to notice it,\nfor the sun rose cloudless and mellow-warm, and as I returned along the\nlane it had turn'd to glittering patches of wet. As I walk I notice\nthe bursting pods of wild-cotton, (Indian hemp they call it here,) with\nflossy-silky contents, and dark red-brown seeds--a startled rabbit--I\npull a handful of the balsamic life-ever-lasting and stuff it down in my\ntrowsers-pocket for scent.\n\n\nTHREE YOUNG MEN'S DEATHS\n\n_December 20_.--Somehow I got thinking to-day of young men's deaths--not\nat all sadly or sentimentally, but gravely, realistically, perhaps a\nlittle artistically. Let me give the following three cases from budgets\nof personal memoranda, which I have been turning over, alone in my room,\nand resuming and dwelling on, this rainy afternoon. Who is there to whom\nthe theme does not come home? Then I don't know how it may be to\nothers, but to me not only is there nothing gloomy or depressing in such\ncases--on the contrary, as reminiscences, I find them soothing, bracing,\ntonic.\n\nERASTUS HASKELL.--[I just transcribe verbatim from a letter written by\nmyself in one of the army hospitals, 16 years ago, during the secession\nwar.] _Washington, July 28, 1863._--Dear M.,--I am writing this in the\nhospital, sitting by the side of a soldier, I do not expect to last many\nhours. His fate has been a hard one--he seems to be only about 19 or\n20--Erastus Haskell, company K, 141st N. Y.--has been out about a year,\nand sick or half-sick more than half that time--has been down on the\npeninsula--was detail'd to go in the band as fifer-boy. While sick, the\nsurgeon told him to keep up with the rest--(probably work'd and march'd\ntoo long.) He is a shy, and seems to me a very sensible boy--has fine\nmanners--never complains--was sick down on the peninsula in an old\nstorehouse--typhoid fever. The first week this July was brought up\nhere--journey very bad, no accommodations, no nourishment, nothing\nbut hard jolting, and exposure enough to make a well man sick; (these\nfearful journeys do the job for many)--arrived here July 11th--a silent\ndark-skinn'd Spanish-looking youth, with large very dark blue eyes,\npeculiar looking. Doctor F. here made light of his sickness--said he\nwould recover soon, etc.; but I thought very different, and told F.\nso repeatedly; (I came near quarreling with him about it from the\nfirst)--but he laugh'd, and would not listen to me. About four days ago,\nI told Doctor he would in my opinion lose the boy without doubt--but F.\nagain laugh'd at me. The next day he changed his opinion--brought the\nhead surgeon of the post--he said the boy would probably die, but they\nwould make a hard fight for him.\n\nThe last two days he has been lying panting for breath--a pitiful\nsight. I have been with him some every day or night since he arrived. He\nsuffers a great deal with the heat--says little or nothing--is flighty\nthe last three days, at times--knows me always, however--calls me\n\"Walter\"--(sometimes calls the name over and over and over again,\nmusingly, abstractedly, to himself.) His father lives at Breesport,\nChemung county, N. Y., is a mechanic with large family--is a steady,\nreligious man; his mother too is living. I have written to them, and\nshall write again to-day--Erastus has not receiv'd a word from home for\nmonths.\n\nAs I sit here writing to you, M., I wish you could see the whole scene.\nThis young man lies within reach of me, flat on his back, his hands\nclasp'd across his breast, his thick black hair cut close; he is dozing,\nbreathing hard, every breath a spasm--it looks so cruel. He is a noble\nyoungster,--I consider him past all hope. Often there is no one with him\nfor a long while. I am here as much as possible.\n\nWILLIAM ALCOTT, fireman. _Camden, Nov., 1874_.--Last Monday afternoon\nhis widow, mother, relatives, mates of the fire department, and his\nother friends, (I was one, only lately it is true, but our love grew\nfast and close, the days and nights of those eight weeks by the chair\nof rapid decline, and the bed of death,) gather'd to the funeral of\nthis young man, who had grown up, and was well-known here. With nothing\nspecial, perhaps, to record, I would give a word or two to his memory.\nHe seem'd to me not an inappropriate specimen in character and elements,\nof that bulk of the average good American race that ebbs and flows\nperennially beneath this scum of eructations on the surface. Always very\nquiet in manner, neat in person and dress, good temper'd--punctual and\nindustrious at his work, till he could work no longer--he just lived his\nsteady, square, unobtrusive life, in its own humble sphere, doubtless\nunconscious of itself. (Though I think there were currents of emotion\nand intellect undevelop'd beneath, far deeper than his acquaintances\never suspected--or than he himself ever did.) He was no talker. His\ntroubles, when he had any, he kept to himself. As there was nothing\nquerulous about him in life, he made no complaints during his last\nsickness. He was one of those persons that while his associates never\nthought of attributing any particular talent or grace to him, yet all\ninsensibly, really, liked Billy Alcott.\n\nI, too, loved him. At last, after being with him quite a good\ndeal--after hours and days of panting for breath, much of the time\nunconscious, (for though the consumption that had been lurking in his\nsystem, once thoroughly started, made rapid progress, there was still\ngreat vitality in him, and indeed for four or five days he lay\ndying, before the close,) late on Wednesday night, Nov. 4th, where we\nsurrounded his bed in silence, there came a lull--a longer drawn breath,\na pause, a faint sigh--another--a weaker breath, another sigh--a pause\nagain and just a tremble--and the face of the poor wasted young man (he\nwas just 26,) fell gently over, in death, on my hand, on the pillow.\n\nCHARLES CASWELL.--[I extract the following, verbatim, from a letter\nto me dated September 29, from my friend John Burroughs, at\nEsopus-on-Hudson, New York State.] S. was away when your picture came,\nattending his sick brother, Charles--who has since died--an event that\nhas sadden'd me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive\nyoung fellow. He work'd at my father's and had done so for two years.\nHe was about the best specimen of a young country farm-hand I ever knew.\nYou would have loved him. He was like one of your poems. With his\ngreat strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment, his\nuniversal good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to\nmatch. He was murder'd by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the\nold fool bled him twice. He lived to wear out the fever, but had not\nstrength to rally. He was out of his head nearly all the time. In the\nmorning, as he died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him, when\nCharlie put up his arms around S.'s neck, and pull'd his face down and\nkiss'd him. S. said he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day\nand night to the last.) When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling\non the hill, and it was a picture to see him walk through the grain. All\nwork seem'd play to him. He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and\nwas belov'd by all who knew him.\n\nI have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to\nyou; he was of your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the\nsweetness of a child, and the strength and courage and readiness of a\nyoung Viking. His mother and father are poor; they have a rough, hard\nfarm. His mother works in the field with her husband when the work\npresses. She has had twelve children.\n\n\nFEBRUARY DAYS\n\n_February 7, 1878_.--Glistening sun today, with slight haze, warm\nenough, and yet tart, as I sit here in the open air, down in my country\nretreat, under an old cedar. For two hours I have been idly wandering\naround the woods and pond, lugging my chair, picking out choice spots to\nsit awhile--then up and slowly on again. All is peace here. Of course,\nnone of the summer noises or vitality; to-day hardly even the winter\nones. I amuse myself by exercising my voice in recitations, and in\nringing the changes on all the vocal and alphabetical sounds. Not even\nan echo; only the cawing of a solitary crow, flying at some distance.\nThe pond is one bright, flat spread, without a ripple--a vast Claude\nLorraine glass, in which I study the sky, the light, the leafless trees,\nand an occasional crow, with flapping wings, flying overhead. The brown\nfields have a few white patches of snow left.\n\n_Feb. 9_.--After an hour's ramble, now retreating, resting, sitting\nclose by the pond, in a warm nook, writing this, shelter'd from the\nbreeze, just before noon. The _emotional_ aspects and influences of\nNature! I, too, like the rest, feel these modern tendencies (from all\nthe prevailing intellections, literature and poems,) to turn everything\nto pathos, ennui, morbidity, dissatisfaction, death. Yet how clear it is\nto me that those are not the born results, influences of Nature at all,\nbut of one's own distorted, sick or silly soul. Here, amid this wild,\nfree scene, how healthy, how joyous, how clean and vigorous and sweet!\n\n_Mid-afternoon_.--One of my nooks is south of the barn, and here I am\nsitting now, on a log, still basking in the sun, shielded from the wind.\nNear me are the cattle, feeding on corn-stalks. Occasionally a cow or\nthe young bull (how handsome and bold he is!) scratches and munches\nthe far end of the log on which I sit. The fresh milky odor is quite\nperceptible, also the perfume of hay from the barn. The perpetual rustle\nof dry corn-stalks, the low sough of the wind round the barn gables, the\ngrunting of pigs, the distant whistle of a locomotive, and occasional\ncrowing of chanticleers, are the sounds.\n\n_Feb. 19._--Cold and sharp last night--clear and not much wind--the full\nmoon shining, and a fine spread of constellations and little and big\nstars--Sirius very bright, rising early, preceded by many-orb'd Orion,\nglittering, vast, sworded, and chasing with his dog. The earth hard\nfrozen, and a stiff glare of ice over the pond. Attracted by the calm\nsplendor of the night, I attempted a short walk, but was driven back\nby the cold. Too severe for me also at 9 o'clock, when I came out this\nmorning, so I turn'd back again. But now, near noon, I have walk'd\ndown the lane, basking all the way in the sun (this farm has a pleasant\nsoutherly exposure,) and here I am, seated under the lee of a bank,\nclose by the water. There are bluebirds already flying about, and I\nhear much chirping and twittering and two or three real songs, sustain'd\nquite awhile, in the mid-day brilliance and warmth. (There! that is a\ntrue carol, coming out boldly and repeatedly, as if the singer meant\nit.) Then as the noon strengthens, the reedy trill of the robin--to my\near the most cheering of bird-notes. At intervals, like bars and breaks\n(out of the low murmur that in any scene, however quiet, is never\nentirely absent to a delicate ear,) the occasional crunch and cracking\nof the ice-glare congeal'd over the creek, as it gives way to the\nsunbeams--sometimes with low sigh--sometimes with indignant, obstinate\ntug and snort.\n\n(Robert Burns says in one of his letters: \"There is scarcely any earthly\nobject gives me more--I do not know if I should call it pleasure--but\nsomething which exalts me--something which enraptures me--than to walk\nin the shelter' d side of a wood in a cloudy winter day, and hear the\nstormy wind howling among the trees, and raving over the plain. It is\nmy best season of devotion.\" Some of his most characteristic poems were\ncomposed in such scenes and seasons.)\n\n\nA MEADOW LARK\n\n_March 16_.--Fine, clear, dazzling morning, the sun an hour high, the\nair just tart enough. What a stamp in advance my whole day receives\nfrom the song of that meadow lark perch'd on a fence-stake twenty rods\ndistant! Two or three liquid-simple notes, repeated at intervals,\nfull of careless happiness and hope. With its peculiar shimmering slow\nprogress and rapid-noiseless action of the wings, it flies on a way,\nlights on another stake, and so on to another, shimmering and singing\nmany minutes.\n\n\nSUNDOWN LIGHTS\n\n_May 6, 5 P. M._--This is the hour for strange effects in light and\nshade-enough to make a colorist go delirious--long spokes of molten\nsilver sent horizontally through the trees (now in their brightest\ntenderest green,) each leaf and branch of endless foliage a lit-up\nmiracle, then lying all prone on the youthful-ripe, interminable grass,\nand giving the blades not only aggregate but individual splendor, in\nways unknown to any other hour. I have particular spots where I get\nthese effects in their perfection. One broad splash lies on the\nwater, with many a rippling twinkle, offset by the rapidly deepening\nblack-green murky-transparent shadows behind, and at intervals all along\nthe banks. These, with great shafts of horizontal fire thrown among the\ntrees and along the grass as the sun lowers, give effects more and more\npeculiar, more and more superb, unearthly, rich and dazzling.\n\n\nTHOUGHTS UNDER AN OAK--A DREAM\n\n_June 2_.--This is the fourth day of a dark northeast storm, wind and\nrain. Day before yesterday was my birthday. I have now enter'd on\nmy 60th year. Every day of the storm, protected by overshoes and a\nwaterproof blanket, I regularly come down to the pond, and ensconce\nmyself under the lee of the great oak; I am here now writing these\nlines. The dark smoke-color'd clouds roll in furious silence athwart the\nsky; the soft green leaves dangle all around me; the wind steadily keeps\nup its hoarse, soothing music over my head--Nature's mighty whisper.\nSeated here in solitude I have been musing over my life--connecting\nevents, dates, as links of a chain, neither sadly nor cheerily, but\nsomehow, to-day here under the oak, in the rain, in an unusually\nmatter-of-fact spirit.\n\nBut my great oak--sturdy, vital, green-five feet thick at the butt. I\nsit a great deal near or under him. Then the tulip tree near by--the\nApollo of the woods--tall and graceful, yet robust and sinewy,\ninimitable in hang of foliage and throwing-out of limb; as if the\nbeauteous, vital, leafy creature could walk, if it only would. (I had\na sort of dream-trance the other day, in which I saw my favorite trees\nstep out and promenade up, down and around, very curiously--with a\nwhisper from one, leaning down as he pass'd me, _We do all this on the\npresent occasion, exceptionally, just for you_.)\n\n\nCLOVER AND HAY PERFUME\n\n_July 3d, 4th, 5th._--Clear, hot, favorable weather--has been a good\nsummer--the growth of clover and grass now generally mow'd. The familiar\ndelicious perfume fills the barns and lanes. As you go along you see the\nfields of grayish white slightly tinged with yellow, the loosely stack'd\ngrain, the slow-moving wagons passing, and farmers in the fields with\nstout boys pitching and loading the sheaves. The corn is about beginning\nto tassel. All over the middle and southern states the spear-shaped\nbattalia, multitudinous, curving, flaunting--long, glossy, dark-green\nplumes for the great horseman, earth. I hear the cheery notes of my old\nacquaintance Tommy quail; but too late for the whip-poor-will, (though\nI heard one solitary lingerer night before last.) I watch the broad\nmajestic flight of a turkey-buzzard, sometimes high up, sometimes low\nenough to see the lines of his form, even his spread quills, in relief\nagainst the sky. Once or twice lately I have seen an eagle here at early\ncandle-light flying low.\n\n\nAN UNKNOWN\n\n_June 15_.--To-day I noticed a new large bird, size of a nearly grown\nhen--a haughty, white-bodied dark-wing'd hawk--I suppose a hawk from his\nbill and general look--only he had a clear, loud, quite musical, sort of\nbell-like call, which he repeated again and again, at intervals, from a\nlofty dead tree-top, overhanging the water. Sat there a long time, and I\non the opposite bank watching him. Then he darted down, skimming pretty\nclose to the stream--rose slowly, a magnificent sight, and sail'd with\nsteady wide-spread wings, no flapping at all, up and down the pond\ntwo or three times, near me, in circles in clear sight, as if for my\ndelectation. Once he came quite close over my head; I saw plainly his\nhook'd bill and hard restless eyes.\n\n\nBIRD-WHISTLING\n\nHow much music (wild, simple, savage, doubtless, but so tart-sweet,)\nthere is in mere whistling. It is four-fifths of the utterance of birds.\nThere are all sorts and styles. For the last half-hour, now, while I\nhave been sitting here, some feather'd fellow away off in the bushes has\nbeen repeating over and over again what I may call a kind of throbbing\nwhistle. And now a bird about the robin size has just appear'd, all\nmulberry red, flitting among the bushes--head, wings, body, deep red,\nnot very bright--no song, as I have heard. _4. o'clock_: There is a real\nconcert going on around me--a dozen different birds pitching in with\na will. There have been occasional rains, and the growths all show its\nvivifying influences. As I finish this, seated on a log close by the\npond-edge, much chirping and trilling in the distance, and a feather'd\nrecluse in the woods near by is singing deliciously--not many notes,\nbut full of music of almost human sympathy--continuing for a long, long\nwhile.\n\n\nHORSE-MINT\n\n_Aug. 22_.--Not a human being, and hardly the evidence of one, in\nsight. After my brief semi-daily bath, I sit here for a bit, the\nbrook musically brawling, to the chromatic tones of a fretful cat-bird\nsomewhere off in the bushes. On my walk hither two hours since, through\nfields and the old lane, I stopt to view, now the sky, now the mile-off\nwoods on the hill, and now the apple orchards. What a contrast from\nNew York's or Philadelphia's streets! Everywhere great patches of\ndingy-blossom'd horse-mint wafting a spicy odor through the air,\n(especially evenings.) Everywhere the flowering boneset, and the\nrose-bloom of the wild bean.\n\n\nTHREE OF US\n\n_July 14_.--My two kingfishers still haunt the pond. In the bright sun\nand breeze and perfect temperature of to-day, noon, I am sitting here\nby one of the gurgling brooks, dipping a French water-pen in the limpid\ncrystal, and using it to write these lines, again watching the feather'd\ntwain, as they fly and sport athwart the water, so close, almost\ntouching into its surface. Indeed there seem to be three of us. For\nnearly an hour I indolently look and join them while they dart and turn\nand take their airy gambols, sometimes far up the creek disappearing for\na few moments, and then surely returning again, and performing most\nof their flight within sight of me, as if they knew I appreciated and\nabsorb'd their vitality, spirituality, faithfulness, and the rapid,\nvanishing, delicate lines of moving yet quiet electricity they draw for\nme across the spread of the grass, the trees, and the blue sky. While\nthe brook babbles, babbles, and the shadows of the boughs dapple in the\nsunshine around me, and the cool west-by-nor'-west wind faintly soughs\nin the thick bushes and tree tops.\n\nAmong the objects of beauty and interest now beginning to appear quite\nplentifully in this secluded spot, I notice the humming-bird, the\ndragon-fly with its wings of slate-color'd guaze, and many varieties of\nbeautiful and plain butterflies, idly flapping among the plants and wild\nposies. The mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves, to a\ntall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high, now studded\nwith knobs of golden blossoms. The milk-weed, (I see a great gorgeous\ncreature of gamboge and black lighting on one as I write,) is in flower,\nwith its delicate red fringe; and there are profuse clusters of a\nfeathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems. I see lots of these\nand much else in every direction, as I saunter or sit. For the last half\nhour a bird has persistently kept up a simple, sweet, melodious song,\nfrom the bushes. (I have a positive conviction that some of these birds\nsing, and others fly and flirt about here for my special benefit.)\n\n\nDEATH OF WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT\n\n_New York City_.--Came on from West Philadelphia, June 13, in the 2 P.\nM. train to Jersey City, and so across and to my friends, Mr. and Mrs.\nJ. H. J., and their large house, large family (and large hearts,)\namid which I feel at home, at peace--away up on Fifth avenue, near\nEighty-sixth street, quiet, breezy, overlooking the dense woody\nfringe of the park--plenty of space and sky, birds chirping, and air\ncomparatively fresh and odorless. Two hours before starting, saw the\nannouncement of William Cullen Bryant's funeral, and felt a strong\ndesire to attend. I had known Mr. Bryant over thirty years ago, and he\nhad been markedly kind to me. Off and on, along that time for years as\nthey pass'd, we met and chatted together. I thought him very sociable in\nhis way, and a man to become attach'd to. We were both walkers, and when\nI work'd in Brooklyn he several times came over, middle of afternoons,\nand we took rambles miles long, till dark, out towards Bedford or\nFlatbush, in company. On these occasions he gave me clear accounts\nof scenes in Europe--the cities, looks, architecture, art, especially\nItaly--where he had travel'd a good deal.\n\n_June 14.--The Funeral_.--And so the good, stainless, noble old citizen\nand poet lies in the closed coffin there--and this is his funeral. A\nsolemn, impressive, simple scene, to spirit and senses. The remarkable\ngathering of gray heads, celebrities--the finely render'd anthem, and\nother music--the church, dim even now at approaching noon, in its light\nfrom the mellow-stain'd windows-the pronounc'd eulogy on the bard who\nloved Nature so fondly, and sung so well her shows and seasons--ending\nwith these appropriate well-known lines:\n\n    I gazed upon the glorious sky,\n      And the green mountains round,\n    And thought that when I came to lie\n      At rest within the ground,\n    'Twere pleasant that in flowery June,\n    When brooks send up a joyous tune,\n      And groves a cheerful sound,\n    The sexton's hand, my grave to make,\n    The rich green mountain turf should break.\n\n\nJAUNT UP THE HUDSON\n\n_June 20th_.--On the \"Mary Powell,\" enjoy'd everything beyond precedent.\nThe delicious tender summer day, just warm enough--the constantly\nchanging but ever beautiful panorama on both sides of the river--(went\nup near a hundred miles)--the high straight walls of the stony\nPalisades--beautiful Yonkers, and beautiful Irvington--the never-ending\nhills, mostly in rounded lines, swathed with verdure,--the distant\nturns, like great shoulders in blue veils--the frequent gray and\nbrown of the tall-rising rocks--the river itself, now narrowing, now\nexpanding--the white sails of the many sloops, yachts, &c., some near,\nsome in the distance--the rapid succession of handsome villages and\ncities, (our boat is a swift traveler, and makes few stops)--the\nRace--picturesque West Point, and indeed all along--the costly and often\nturreted mansions forever showing in some cheery light color, through\nthe woods--make up the scene.\n\n\nHAPPINESS AND RASPBERRIES\n\n_June 21_.--Here I am, on the west bank of the Hudson, 80 miles\nnorth of New York, near Esopus, at the handsome, roomy,\nhoneysuckle-and-rose-enbower'd cottage of John Burroughs. The place,\nthe perfect June days and nights, (leaning toward crisp and cool,)\nthe hospitality of J. and Mrs. B., the air, the fruit, (especially my\nfavorite dish, currants and raspberries, mixed, sugar'd, fresh and ripe\nfrom the bushes--I pick 'em myself)--the room I occupy at night, the\nperfect bed, the window giving an ample view of the Hudson and the\nopposite shores, so wonderful toward sunset, and the rolling music\nof the RR. trains, far over there--the peaceful rest--the early\nVenus-heralded dawn--the noiseless splash of sunrise, the light and\nwarmth indescribably glorious, in which, (soon as the sun is well up,)\nI have a capital rubbing and rasping with the flesh-brush--with an extra\nscour on the back by Al. J., who is here with us--all inspiriting my\ninvalid frame with new life, for the day. Then, after some whiffs\nof morning air, the delicious coffee of Mrs. B., with the cream,\nstrawberries, and many substantials, for breakfast.\n\nA SPECIMEN TRAMP FAMILY\n\n_June 22_.--This afternoon we went out (J. B., Al. and I) on quite a\ndrive around the country. The scenery, the perpetual stone fences,\n(some venerable old fellows, dark-spotted with lichens)--the many\nfine locust-trees--the runs of brawling water, often over descents of\nrock--these, and lots else. It is lucky the roads are first-rate here,\n(as they are,) for it is up or down hill everywhere, and sometimes steep\nenough. B. has a tip-top horse, strong, young, and both gentle and\nfast. There is a great deal of waste land and hills on the river edge\nof Ulster county, with a wonderful luxuriance of wild flowers and\nbushes--and it seems to me I never saw more vitality of trees--eloquent\nhemlocks, plenty of locusts and fine maples, and the balm of Gilead,\ngiving out aroma. In the fields and along the road-sides unusual crops\nof the tall-stemm'd wild daisy, white as milk and yellow as gold.\n\nWe pass'd quite a number of tramps, singly or in couples--one squad, a\nfamily in a rickety one-horse wagon, with some baskets evidently their\nwork and trade--the man seated on a low board, in front, driving--the\ngauntish woman by his side, with a baby well bundled in her arms, its\nlittle red feet and lower legs sticking out right towards us as we\npass'd--and in the wagon behind, we saw two (or three) crouching little\nchildren. It was a queer, taking, rather sad picture. If I had been\nalone and on foot, I should have stopp'd and held confab. But on our\nreturn nearly two hours afterward, we found them a ways further along\nthe same road, in a lonesome open spot, haul'd aside, unhitch'd, and\nevidently going to camp for the night. The freed horse was not far off,\nquietly cropping the grass. The man was busy at the wagon, the boy had\ngather'd some dry wood, and was making a fire--and as we went a little\nfurther we met the woman afoot. I could not see her face, in its\ngreat sun-bonnet, but somehow her figure and gait told misery, terror,\ndestitution. She had the rag-bundled, half-starv'd infant still in\nher arms, and in her hands held two or three baskets, which she had\nevidently taken to the next house for sale. A little barefoot five-year\nold girl-child, with fine eyes, trotted behind her, clutching her gown.\nWe stopp'd, asking about the baskets, which we bought. As we paid the\nmoney, she kept her face hidden in the recesses of her bonnet. Then as\nwe started, and stopp'd again, Al., (whose sympathies were evidently\narous'd,) went back to the camping group to get another basket. He\ncaught a look of her face, and talk'd with her a little. Eyes, voice and\nmanner were those of a corpse, animated by electricity. She was quite\nyoung--the man she was traveling with, middle-aged. Poor woman--what\nstory was it, out of her fortunes, to account for that inexpressibly\nscared way, those glassy eyes, and that hollow voice?\n\n\nMANHATTAN FROM THE BAY\n\n_June 25_.--Returned to New York last night. Out to-day on the waters\nfor a sail in the wide bay, southeast of Staten island--a rough, tossing\nride, and a free sight--the long stretch of Sandy Hook, the highlands\nof Navesink, and the many vessels outward and inward bound. We came up\nthrough the midst of all, in the full sun. I especially enjoy'd the last\nhour or two. A moderate sea-breeze had set in; yet over the city, and\nthe waters adjacent, was a thin haze, concealing nothing, only adding to\nthe beauty. From my point of view, as I write amid the soft breeze, with\na sea-temperature, surely nothing on earth of its kind can go beyond\nthis show. To the left the North river with its far vista--nearer, three\nor four war-ships, anchor'd peacefully--the Jersey side, the banks of\nWeehawken, the Palisades, and the gradually receding blue, lost in the\ndistance--to the right the East river--the mast-hemm'd shores--the grand\nobelisk-like towers of the bridge, one on either side, in haze,\nyet plainly defin'd, giant brothers twain, throwing free graceful\ninterlinking loops high across the tumbled tumultuous current\nbelow--(the tide is just changing to its ebb)--the broad water-spread\neverywhere crowded--no, not crowded, but thick as stars in the sky--with\nall sorts and sizes of sail and steam vessels, plying ferry-boats,\narriving and departing coasters, great ocean Dons, iron-black, modern,\nmagnificent in size and power, fill'd with their incalculable value of\nhuman life and precious merchandise--with here and there, above all,\nthose daring, careening things of grace and wonder, those white and\nshaded swift-darting fish-birds, (I wonder if shore or sea elsewhere\ncan outvie them,) ever with their slanting spars, and fierce, pure,\nhawk-like beauty and motion--first-class New York sloop or schooner\nyachts, sailing, this fine day, the free sea in a good wind. And\nrising out of the midst, tall-topt, ship-hemm'd, modern, American,\nyet strangely oriental, V-shaped Manhattan, with its compact mass, its\nspires, its cloud-touching edifices group'd at the centre--the green of\nthe trees, and all the white, brown and gray of the architecture well\nblended, as I see it, under a miracle of limpid sky, delicious light of\nheaven above, and June haze on the surface below.\n\n\nHUMAN AND HEROIC NEW YORK\n\nThe general subjective view of New York and Brooklyn--(will not the\ntime hasten when the two shall be municipally united in one, and named\nManhattan?)--what I may call the human interior and exterior of these\ngreat seething oceanic populations, as I get it in this visit, is to\nme best of all. After an absence of many years, (I went away at the\noutbreak of the secession war, and have never been back to stay since,)\nagain I resume with curiosity the crowds, the streets, I knew so\nwell, Broadway, the ferries, the west side of the city, democratic\nBowery--human appearances and manners as seen in all these, and along\nthe wharves, and in the perpetual travel of the horse-cars, or the\ncrowded excursion steamers, or in Wall and Nassau streets by day--in the\nplaces of amusement at night--bubbling and whirling and moving like\nits own environment of waters--endless humanity in all phases--Brooklyn\nalso--taken in for the last three weeks. No need to specify\nminutely--enough to say that (making all allowances for the shadows\nand side-streaks of a million-headed-city) the brief total of the\nimpressions, the human qualities, of these vast cities, is to me\ncomforting, even heroic, beyond statement. Alertness, generally fine\nphysique, clear eyes that look straight at you, a singular combination\nof reticence and self-possession, with good nature and friendliness--a\nprevailing range of according manners, taste and intellect, surely\nbeyond any elsewhere upon earth--and a palpable outcropping of that\npersonal comradeship I look forward to as the subtlest, strongest future\nhold of this many-item'd Union--are not only constantly visible here\nin these mighty channels of men, but they form the rule and average.\nTo-day, I should say--defiant of cynics and pessimists, and with a full\nknowledge of all their exceptions--an appreciative and perceptive study\nof the current humanity of New York gives the directest proof yet\nof successful Democracy, and of the solution of that paradox, the\neligibility of the free and fully developed individual with the\nparamount aggregate. In old age, lame and sick, pondering for years on\nmany a doubt and danger for this republic of ours--fully aware of all\nthat can be said on the other side--I find in this visit to New York,\nand the daily contact and rapport with its myriad people, on the scale\nof the oceans and tides, the best, most effective medicine my soul has\nyet partaken--the grandest physical habitat and surroundings of land and\nwater the globe affords--namely, Manhattan island and Brooklyn, which\nthe future shall join in one city--city of superb democracy, amid superb\nsurroundings.\n\n\nHOURS FOR THE SOUL\n\n_July 22d, 1878_.--Living down in the country again. A wonderful\nconjunction of all that goes to make those sometime miracle-hours after\nsunset--so near and yet so far. Perfect, or nearly perfect days, I\nnotice, are not so very uncommon; but the combinations that make perfect\nnights are few, even in a life time. We have one of those perfections\nto-night. Sunset left things pretty clear; the larger stars were visible\nsoon as the shades allow'd. A while after 8, three or four great black\nclouds suddenly rose, seemingly from different points, and sweeping\nwith broad swirls of wind but no thunder, underspread the orbs from\nview everywhere, and indicated a violent heatstorm. But without storm,\nclouds, blackness and all, sped and vanish'd as suddenly as they had\nrisen; and from a little after 9 till 11 the atmosphere and the whole\nshow above were in that state of exceptional clearness and glory just\nalluded to. In the northwest turned the Great Dipper with its pointers\nround the Cynosure. A little south of east the constellation of the\nScorpion was fully up, with red Antares glowing in its neck; while\ndominating, majestic Jupiter swam, an hour and a half risen, in the\neast--(no moon till after 11.) A large part of the sky seem'd just\nlaid in great splashes of phosphorus. You could look deeper in, farther\nthrough, than usual; the orbs thick as heads of wheat in a field. Not\nthat there was any special brilliancy either--nothing near as sharp as\nI have seen of keen winter nights, but a curious general luminousness\nthroughout to sight, sense, and soul. The latter had much to do with it.\n(I am convinced there are hours of Nature, especially of the atmosphere,\nmornings and evenings, address'd to the soul. Night transcends, for that\npurpose, what the proudest day can do.) Now, indeed, if never before,\nthe heavens declared the glory of God. It was to the full sky of the\nBible, of Arabia, of the prophets, and of the oldest poems. There,\nin abstraction and stillness, (I had gone off by myself to absorb the\nscene, to have the spell unbroken,) the copiousness, the removedness,\nvitality, loose-clear-crowdedness, of that stellar concave spreading\noverhead, softly absorb'd into me, rising so free, interminably high,\nstretching east, west, north, south--and I, though but a point in the\ncentre below, embodying all.\n\nAs if for the first time, indeed, creation noiselessly sank into and\nthrough me its placid and untellable lesson, beyond--O, so infinitely\nbeyond!--anything from art, books, sermons, or from science, old or new.\nThe spirit's hour--religion's hour--the visible suggestion of God in\nspace and time--now once definitely indicated, if never again. The\nuntold pointed at--the heavens all paved with it. The Milky Way, as if\nsome superhuman symphony, some ode of universal vagueness, disdaining\nsyllable and sound--a flashing glance of Deity, address'd to the soul.\nAll silently--the indescribable night and stars--far off and silently.\n\nTHE DAWN.--_July 23_.--This morning, between one and two hours before\nsunrise, a spectacle wrought on the same background, yet of quite\ndifferent beauty and meaning. The moon well up in the heavens, and past\nher half, is shining brightly--the air and sky of that cynical-clear,\nMinerva-like quality, virgin cool--not the weight of sentiment or\nmystery, or passion's ecstasy indefinable--not the religious sense,\nthe varied All, distill'd and sublimated into one, of the night just\ndescribed. Every star now clear-cut, showing for just what it is, there\nin the colorless ether. The character of the heralded morning, ineffably\nsweet and fresh and limpid, but for the esthetic sense alone, and for\npurity without sentiment. I have itemized the night--but dare I attempt\nthe cloudless dawn? (What subtle tie is this between one's soul and the\nbreak of day? Alike, and yet no two nights or morning shows ever exactly\nalike.) Preceded by an immense star, almost unearthly in its effusion\nof white splendor, with two or three long unequal spoke-rays of diamond\nradiance, shedding down through the fresh morning air below--an hour of\nthis, and then the sunrise.\n\nTHE EAST.--What a subject for a poem! Indeed, where else a more\npregnant, more splendid one? Where one more idealistic-real, more\nsubtle, more sensuous-delicate? The East, answering all lands, all\nages, peoples; touching all senses, here, immediate, now--and yet so\nindescribably far off--such retrospect! The East--long-stretching--so\nlosing itself--the orient, the gardens of Asia, the womb of history\nand song--forth-issuing all those strange, dim cavalcades--Florid\nwith blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion. Sultry with\nperfume, with ample and flowing garment. With sunburnt visage, intense\nsoul and glittering eyes. Always the East--old, how incalculably old!\nAnd yet here the same--ours yet, fresh as a rose, to every morning,\nevery life, to-day--and always will be.\n\n_Sept. 17_. Another presentation--same theme--just before sunrise again,\n(a favorite hour with me.) The clear gray sky, a faint glow in the\ndull liver-color of the east, the cool fresh odor and the moisture--the\ncattle and horses off there grazing in the fields--the star Venus again,\ntwo hours high. For sounds, the chirping of crickets in the grass, the\nclarion of chanticleer, and the distant cawing of an early crow. Quietly\nover the dense fringe of cedars and pines rises that dazzling, red,\ntransparent disk of flame, and the low sheets of white vapor roll and\nroll into dissolution.\n\nTHE MOON.--_May 18_.--I went to bed early last night, but found myself\nwaked shortly after 12, and, turning awhile, sleepless and mentally\nfeverish, I rose, dress'd myself, sallied forth and walk'd down the\nlane. The full moon, some three or four hours up--a sprinkle of light\nand less-light clouds just lazily moving--Jupiter an hour high in the\neast, and here and there throughout the heavens a random star appearing\nand disappearing. So beautifully veiled and varied--the air, with that\nearly-summer perfume, not at all damp or raw--at times Luna languidly\nemerging in richest brightness for minutes, and then partially envelop'd\nagain. Far off a poor whip-poor-will plied his notes incessantly. It was\nthat silent time between 1 and 3.\n\nThe rare nocturnal scene, how soon it sooth'd and pacified me! Is there\nnot something about the moon, some relation or reminder, which no poem\nor literature has yet caught? (In very old and primitive ballads I have\ncome across lines or asides that suggest it.) After a while the clouds\nmostly clear'd, and as the moon swam on, she carried, shimmering and\nshifting, delicate color-effects of pellucid green and tawny vapor. Let\nme conclude this part with an extract, (some writer in the \"Tribune,\"\nMay 16, 1878):\n\n  No one ever gets tired of the moon. Goddess that she is by dower of\n  her eternal beauty, she is a true woman by her tact--knows the charm\n  of being seldom seen, of coming by surprise and staying but a little\n  while; never wears the same dress two nights running, nor all night\n  the same way; commends herself to the matter-of-fact people by her\n  usefulness, and makes her uselessness adored by poets, artists, and\n  all lovers in all lands; lends herself to every symbolism and to\n  every emblem; is Diana's bow and Venus's mirror and Mary's throne;\n  is a sickle, a scarf, an eyebrow, his face or her face, and look'd\n  at by her or by him; is the madman's hell, the poet's heaven, the\n  baby's toy, the philosopher's study; and while her admirers follow\n  her footsteps, and hang on her lovely looks, she knows how to keep\n  her woman's secret--her other side--unguess'd and unguessable.\n\n_Furthermore. February 19, 1880_.--Just before 10 P.M. cold and entirely\nclear again, the show overhead, bearing southwest, of wonderful and\ncrowded magnificence. The moon in her third quarter--the clusters of\nthe Hyades and Pleiades, with the planet Mars between--in full crossing\nsprawl in the sky the great Egyptian X, (Sirius, Procyon, and the main\nstars in the constellations of the Ship, the Dove, and of Orion;) just\nnorth of east Bootes, and in his knee Arcturus, an hour high, mounting\nthe heaven, ambitiously large and sparkling, as if he meant to challenge\nwith Sirius the stellar supremacy.\n\nWith the sentiment of the stars and moon such nights I get all the\nfree margins and indefiniteness of music or poetry, fused in geometry's\nutmost exactness.\n\n\nSTRAW-COLOR'D AND OTHER PSYCHES\n\n_Aug. 4_.--A pretty sight! Where I sit in the shade--a warm day, the sun\nshining from cloudless skies, the forenoon well advanc'd--I look over\na ten-acre field of luxuriant clover-hay, (the second crop)--the\nlivid-ripe red blossoms and dabs of August brown thickly spotting\nthe prevailing dark-green. Over all flutter myriads of light-yellow\nbutterflies, mostly skimming along the surface, dipping and oscillating,\ngiving a curious animation to the scene. The beautiful, spiritual\ninsects! straw-color'd Psyches! Occasionally one of them leaves his\nmates, and mounts, perhaps spirally, perhaps in a straight line in the\nair, fluttering up, up, till literally out of sight. In the lane as I\ncame along just now I noticed one spot, ten feet square or so, where\nmore than a hundred had collected, holding a revel, a gyration-dance, or\nbutterfly good-time, winding and circling, down and across, but always\nkeeping within the limits. The little creatures have come out all of a\nsudden the last few days, and are now very plentiful. As I sit outdoors,\nor walk, I hardly look around without somewhere seeing two (always two)\nfluttering through the air in amorous dalliance. Then their inimitable\ncolor, their fragility, peculiar motion--and that strange, frequent\nway of one leaving the crowd and mounting up, up in the free ether, and\napparently never returning. As I look over the field, these yellow-wings\neverywhere mildly sparkling, many snowy blossoms of the wild carrot\ngracefully bending on their tall and taper stems--while for sounds, the\ndistant guttural screech of a flock of guinea-hens comes shrilly yet\nsomehow musically to my ears. And now a faint growl of heat-thunder in\nthe north--and ever the low rising and falling wind-purr from the tops\nof the maples and willows.\n\n_Aug. 20_.--Butterflies and butterflies, (taking the place of the\nbumble-bees of three months since, who have quite disappear'd,) continue\nto flit to and fro, all sorts, white, yellow, brown, purple--now and\nthen some gorgeous fellow flashing lazily by on wings like artists'\npalettes dabb'd with every color. Over the breast of the pond I notice\nmany white ones, crossing, pursuing their idle capricious flight. Near\nwhere I sit grows a tall-stemm'd weed topt with a profusion of rich\nscarlet blossoms, on which the snowy insects alight and dally, sometimes\nfour or five of them at a time. By-and-by a humming-bird visits\nthe same, and I watch him coming and going, daintily balancing and\nshimmering about. These white butterflies give new beautiful contrasts\nto the pure greens of the August foliage, (we have had some copious\nrains lately,) and over the glistening bronze of the pond-surface. You\ncan tame even such insects; I have one big and handsome moth down here,\nknows and comes to me, likes me to hold him up on my extended hand.\n\n_Another Day, later_.--A grand twelve-acre field of ripe cabbages with\ntheir prevailing hue of malachite green, and floating-flying over and\namong them in all directions myriads of these same white butterflies. As\nI came up the lane to-day I saw a living globe of the same, two or three\nfeet in diameter, many scores cluster'd together and rolling along\nin the air, adhering to their ball-shape, six or eight feet above the\nground.\n\n\nA NIGHT REMEMBRANCE\n\n_Aug. 23, 9-10 A.M._--I sit by the pond, everything quiet, the broad\npolish'd surface spread before me--the blue of the heavens and the\nwhite clouds reflected from it--and flitting across, now and then, the\nreflection of some flying bird. Last night I was down here with a friend\ntill after midnight; everything a miracle of splendor--the glory of the\nstars, and the completely rounded moon--the passing clouds, silver and\nluminous-tawny--now and then masses of vapory illuminated scud--and\nsilently by my side my dear friend. The shades of the trees, and patches\nof moonlight on the grass--the softly blowing breeze, and just-palpable\nodor of the neighboring ripening corn--the indolent and spiritual night,\ninexpressibly rich, tender, suggestive--something altogether to filter\nthrough one's soul, and nourish and feed and soothe the memory long\nafterwards.\n\n\nWILD FLOWERS\n\nThis has been and is yet a great season for wild flowers; oceans of them\nline the roads through the woods, border the edges of the water-runlets,\ngrow all along the old fences, and are scatter'd in profusion over the\nfields. An eight-petal'd blossom of gold-yellow, clear and bright, with\na brown tuft in the middle, nearly as large as a silver half-dollar, is\nvery common; yesterday on a long drive I noticed it thickly lining the\nborders of the brooks everywhere. Then there is a beautiful weed cover'd\nwith blue flowers, (the blue of the old Chinese teacups treasur'd by our\ngrand-aunts,) I am continually stopping to admire--a little larger than\na dime, and very plentiful. White, however, is the prevailing color. The\nwild carrot I have spoken of; also the fragrant life-everlasting. But\nthere are all hues and beauties, especially on the frequent tracts of\nhalf-opened scrub-oak and dwarf cedar hereabout--wild asters of all\ncolors. Notwithstanding the frost-touch the hardy little chaps maintain\nthemselves in all their bloom. The tree-leaves, too, some of them are\nbeginning to turn yellow or drab or dull green. The deep wine-color of\nthe sumachs and gum-treesis already visible, and the straw-color of the\ndog-wood and beech. Let me give the names of some of these perennial\nblossoms and friendly weeds I have made acquaintance with hereabout one\nseason or another in my walks:\n\nWild azalea, dandelions wild honeysuckle, yarrow, wild roses, coreopsis,\ngolden rod, wild pea, larkspur, woodbine, early crocus, elderberry,\nsweet flag, (great patches of it,) poke-weed, creeper, trumpet-flower,\nsun-flower, scented marjoram, chamomile, snakeroot, violets, Solomon's\nseal, clematis, sweet balm, bloodroot mint, (great plenty,) swamp\nmagnolia, wild geranium, milk-weed, wild heliotrope, wild daisy,\n(plenty,) burdock, wild chrysanthemum.\n\n\nA CIVILITY TOO LONG NEGLECTED\n\nThe foregoing reminds me of something.\n\nAs the individualities I would mainly portray have certainly been\nslighted by folks who make pictures, volumes, poems, out of them--as\na faint testimonial of my own gratitude for many hours of peace and\ncomfort in half-sickness, (and not by any means sure but they will\nsomehow get wind of the compliment,) I hereby dedicate the last half of\nthese Specimen Days to the\n\n  bees,                                     glow-worms, (swarming millions\n  black-birds,                                of them indescribably\n  dragon-flies,                               strange and beautiful at night\n  pond-turtles,                               over the pond and creek,)\n  mulleins, tansy, peppermint,              water-snakes,\n  moths, (great and little, some            crows,\n          splendid fellows,)                millers,\n  mosquitoes,                               cedars,\n  butterflies,                              tulip-trees, (and all other trees,)\n  wasps and hornets,                          and to the spots and memories\n  cat-birds, (and all other birds,)           of those days, and the creek.\n\n\nDELAWARE RIVER--DAYS AND NIGHTS\n\n_April 5, 1879_.-With the return of spring to the skies, airs, waters of\nthe Delaware, return the sea-gulls. I never tire of watching their broad\nand easy flight, in spirals, or as they oscillate with slow unflapping\nwings, or look down with curved beak, or dipping to the water after\nfood. The crows, plenty enough all through the winter, have vanish'd\nwith the ice. Not one of them now to be seen. The steamboats have again\ncome forth--bustling up, handsome, freshly painted, for summer work--the\nColumbia, the Edwin Forrest, (the Republic not yet out,) the Reybold,\nNelly White, the Twilight, the Ariel, the Warner, the Perry, the\nTaggart, the Jersey Blue--even the hulky old Trenton--not forgetting\nthose saucy little bull-pups of the current, the steamtugs.\n\nBut let me bunch and catalogue the affair--the river itself, all the\nway from the sea--Cape island on one side and Henlopen light on the\nother--up the broad bay north, and so to Philadelphia, and on further to\nTrenton;--the sights I am most familiar with, (as I live a good part\nof the time in Camden, I view matters from that outlook)--the great\narrogant, black, full-freighted ocean steamers, inward or outward\nbound--the ample width here between the two cities, intersected by\nWindmill island--an occasional man-of-war, sometimes a foreigner, at\nanchor, with her guns and port-holes, and the boats, and the brown-faced\nsailors, and the regular oar-strokes, and the gay crowds of \"visiting\nday\"--the frequent large and handsome three-masted schooners, (a\nfavorite style of marine build, hereabout of late years,) some of\nthem new and very jaunty, with their white-gray sails and yellow pine\nspars--the sloops dashing along in a fair wind--(I see one now, coming\nup, under broad canvas, her gaff-topsail shining in the sun, high and\npicturesque--what a thing of beauty amid the sky and waters!)--the\ncrowded wharf-slips along the city--the flags of different\nnationalities, the sturdy English cross on its ground of blood, the\nFrench tricolor, the banner of the great North German empire, and the\nItalian and the Spanish colors--sometimes, of an afternoon, the whole\nscene enliven'd by a fleet of yachts, in a half calm, lazily returning\nfrom a race down at Gloucester;--the neat, rakish, revenue steamer\n\"Hamilton\" in mid-stream, with her perpendicular stripes flaunting\naft--and, turning the eyes north, the long ribands of fleecy-white\nsteam, or dingy-black smoke, stretching far, fan-shaped, slanting\ndiagonally across from the Kensington or Richmond shores, in the\nwest-by-south-west wind.\n\n\nSCENES ON FERRY AND RIVER--LAST WINTER'S NIGHTS\n\nThen the Camden ferry. What exhilaration, change, people, business, by\nday. What soothing, silent, wondrous hours, at night, crossing on the\nboat, most all to myself--pacing the deck, alone, forward or aft. What\ncommunion with the waters, the air, the exquisite _chiaroscuro_--the\nsky and stars, that speak no word, nothing to the intellect, yet so\neloquent, so communicative to the soul. And the ferry men--little they\nknow how much they have been to me, day and night--how many spells of\nlistlessness, ennui, debility, they and their hardy ways have dispell'd.\nAnd the pilots--captains Hand, Walton, and Giberson by day, and captain\nOlive at night; Eugene Crosby, with his strong young arm so often\nsupporting, circling, convoying me over the gaps of the bridge, through\nimpediments, safely aboard. Indeed all my ferry friends--captain Frazee\nthe superintendent, Lindell, Hiskey, Fred Rauch, Price, Watson, and\na dozen more. And the ferry itself, with its queer scenes--sometimes\nchildren suddenly born in the waiting-houses (an actual fact--and more\nthan once)--sometimes a masquerade party, going over at night, with a\nband of music, dancing and whirling like mad on the broad deck, in their\nfantastic dresses; sometimes the astronomer, Mr. Whitall, (who posts\nme up in points about the stars by a living lesson there and then, and\nanswering every question)--sometimes a prolific family group, eight,\nnine, ten, even twelve! (Yesterday, as I cross'd, a mother, father, and\neight children, waiting in the ferry-house, bound westward somewhere.)\n\nI have mention'd the crows. I always watch them from the boats. They\nplay quite a part in the winter scenes on the river, by day. Their black\nsplatches are seen in relief against the snow and ice everywhere at that\nseason--sometimes flying and flapping--sometimes on little or larger\ncakes, sailing up or down the stream. One day the river was mostly\nclear--only a single long ridge of broken ice making a narrow stripe by\nitself, running along down the current for over a mile, quite rapidly.\nOn this white stripe the crows were congregated, hundreds of them--a\nfunny procession--(\"half mourning\" was the comment of some one.)\n\nThen the reception room, for passengers waiting--life illustrated\nthoroughly. Take a March picture I jotted there two or three weeks\nsince. Afternoon, about 3-1/2 o'clock, it begins to snow. There has been\na matinee performance at the theater--from 4-1/2 to 5 comes a stream\nof homeward bound ladies. I never knew the spacious room to present a\ngayer, more lively scene--handsome, well-drest Jersey women and girls,\nscores of them, streaming in for nearly an hour--the bright eyes and\nglowing faces, coming in from the air--a sprinkling of snow on bonnets\nor dresses as they enter--the five or ten minutes' waiting--the chatting\nand laughing--(women can have capital times among themselves, with\nplenty of wit, lunches, jovial abandon)--Lizzie, the pleasant-manner'd\nwaiting-room woman--for sound, the bell-taps and steam-signals of the\ndeparting boats with their rhythmic break and undertone--the\ndomestic pictures, mothers with bevies of daughters, (a charming\nsight)--children, countrymen--the railroad men in their blue clothes\nand caps--all the various characters of city and country represented\nor suggested. Then outside some belated passenger frantically running,\njumping after the boat. Towards six o' clock the human stream\ngradually thickening--now a pressure of vehicles, drays, piled railroad\ncrates--now a drove of cattle, making quite an excitement, the drovers\nwith heavy sticks, belaboring the steaming sides of the frighten'd\nbrutes. Inside the reception room, business bargains, flirting,\nlove-making, _eclaircissements_, proposals--pleasant, sober-faced Phil\ncoming in with his burden of afternoon papers--or Jo, or Charley (who\njump'd in the dock last week, and saved a stout lady from drowning,) to\nreplenish the stove, and clearing it with long crow-bar poker.\n\nBesides all this \"comedy human,\" the river affords nutriment of a\nhigher order. Here are some of my memoranda of the past winter, just as\npencill'd down on the spot.\n\n_A January Night_.--Fine trips across the wide Delaware to-night. Tide\npretty high, and a strong ebb. River, a little after 8, full of ice,\nmostly broken, but some large cakes making our strong-timber'd steamboat\nhum and quiver as she strikes them. In the clear moonlight they spread,\nstrange, unearthly, silvery, faintly glistening, as far as I can see.\nBumping, trembling, sometimes hissing like a thousand snakes, the\ntide-procession, as we wend with or through it, affording a grand\nundertone, in keeping with the scene. Overhead, the splendor\nindescribable; yet something haughty, almost supercilious, in the night.\nNever did I realize more latent sentiment, almost _passion_, in those\nsilent interminable stars up there. One can understand, such a night,\nwhy, from the days of the Pharaohs or Job, the dome of heaven, sprinkled\nwith planets, has supplied the subtlest, deepest criticism on human\npride, glory, ambition.\n\n_Another Winter Night_.--I don't know anything more _filling_ than to be\non the wide firm deck of a powerful boat, a clear, cool, extra-moonlight\nnight, crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick, marbly,\nglistening ice. The whole river is now spread with it--some immense\ncakes. There is such weirdness about the scene--partly the quality of\nthe light, with its tinge of blue, the lunar twilight--only the large\nstars holding their own in the radiance of the moon. Temperature sharp,\ncomfortable for motion, dry, full of oxygen. But the sense of power--the\nsteady, scornful, imperious urge of our strong new engine, as she\nploughs her way through the big and little cakes.\n\n_Another_.--For two hours I cross'd and recross'd, merely for\npleasure--for a still excitement. Both sky and river went through\nseveral changes. The first for awhile held two vast fan-shaped echelons\nof light clouds, through which the moon waded, now radiating, carrying\nwith her an aureole of tawny transparent brown, and now flooding the\nwhole vast with clear vapory light-green, through which, as through an\nilluminated veil, she moved with measur'd womanly motion. Then, another\ntrip, the heavens would be absolutely clear, and Luna in all her\neffulgence. The big Dipper in the north, with the double star in the\nhandle much plainer than common. Then the sheeny track of light in the\nwater, dancing and rippling. Such transformations; such pictures and\npoems, inimitable.\n\n_Another_.--I am studying the stars, under advantages, as I cross\ntonight. (It is late in February, and again extra clear.) High toward\nthe west, the Pleiades, tremulous with delicate sparkle, in the soft\nheavens,--Aldebaran, leading the V-shaped Hyades--and overhead Capella\nand her kids. Most majestic of all, in full display in the high south,\nOrion, vast-spread, roomy, chief historian of the stage, with his shiny\nyellow rosette on his shoulder, and his three kings--and a little to\nthe east, Sirius, calmly arrogant, most wondrous single star. Going late\nashore, (I couldn't give up the beauty, and soothingness of the night,)\nas I staid around, or slowly wander'd I heard the echoing calls of\nthe railroad men in the West Jersey depot yard, shifting and switching\ntrains, engines, etc.; amid the general silence otherways, and something\nin the acoustic quality of the air, musical, emotional effects, never\nthought of before. I linger'd long and long, listening to them.\n\n_Night of March 18, '79_.--One of the calm, pleasantly cool, exquisitely\nclear and cloudless, early spring nights--the atmosphere again that rare\nvitreous blue-black, welcom'd by astronomers. Just at 8, evening, the\nscene overhead of certainly solemnest beauty, never surpass'd. Venus\nnearly down in the west, of a size and lustre as if trying to outshow\nherself, before departing. Teeming, maternal orb--I take you again to\nmyself. I am reminded of that spring preceding Abraham Lincoln's murder,\nwhen I, restlessly haunting the Potomac banks, around Washington city,\nwatch'd you, off there, aloof, moody as myself:\n\n    As we walk'd up and down in the dark blue so mystic,\n    As we walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,\n    As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after\n      night,\n    As you droop from the sky low down, as if to my side, (while the\n      other stars all look'd on,)\n    As we wander'd together the solemn night.\n\nWith departing Venus, large to the last, and shining even to the edge\nof the horizon, the vast dome presents at this moment, such a spectacle!\nMercury was visible just after sunset--a rare sight. Arcturus is now\nrisen, just north of east. In calm glory all the stars of Orion hold the\nplace of honor, in meridian, to the south,--with the Dog-star a little\nto the left. And now, just rising, Spica, late, low, and slightly\nveil'd. Castor, Regulus and the rest, all shining unusually clear, (no\nMars or Jupiter or moon till morning.) On the edge of the river, many\nlamps twinkling--with two or three huge chimneys, a couple of miles up,\nbelching forth molten, steady flames, volcano-like, illuminating all\naround--and sometimes an electric or calcium, its Dante-Inferno\ngleams, in far shafts, terrible, ghastly-powerful. Of later May nights,\ncrossing, I like to watch the fishermen's little buoy-lights--so pretty,\nso dreamy--like corpse candles--undulating delicate and lonesome on the\nsurface of the shadowy waters, floating with the current.\n\n\nTHE FIRST SPRING DAY ON CHESTNUT STREET\n\nWinter relaxing its hold, has already allow'd us a foretaste of spring.\nAs I write, yesterday afternoon's softness and brightness, (after\nthe morning fog, which gave it a better setting, by contrast,) show'd\nChestnut street--say between Broad and Fourth--to more advantage in its\nvarious asides, and all its stores, and gay-dress'd crowds generally,\nthan for three months past. I took a walk there between one and two.\nDoubtless, there were plenty of hard-up folks along the pavements, but\nnine-tenths of the myriad-moving human panorama to all appearance seem'd\nflush, well-fed, and fully-provided. At all events it was good\nto be on Chestnut street yesterday. The peddlers on the\nsidewalk--(\"sleeve-buttons, three for five cents\")--the handsome little\nfellow with canary-bird whistles--the cane men, toy men, toothpick\nmen--the old woman squatted in a heap on the cold stone flags, with\nher basket of matches, pins and tape--the young negro mother, sitting,\nbegging, with her two little coffee-color'd twins on her lap--the beauty\nof the cramm'd conservatory of rare flowers, flaunting reds, yellows,\nsnowy lilies, incredible orchids, at the Baldwin mansion near Twelfth\nstreet--the show of fine poultry, beef, fish, at the restaurants--the\nchina stores, with glass and statuettes--the luscious tropical\nfruits--the street cars plodding along, with their tintinnabulating\nbells--the fat, cab-looking, rapidly driven one-horse vehicles of\nthe post-office, squeez'd full of coming or going letter-carriers, so\nhealthy and handsome and manly-looking, in their gray uniforms--the\ncostly books, pictures, curiosities, in the windows--the gigantic\npolicemen at most of the corners will all be readily remember'd and\nrecognized as features of this principal avenue of Philadelphia.\nChestnut street, I have discover'd, is not without individuality, and\nits own points, even when compared with the great promenade-streets of\nother cities. I have never been in Europe, but acquired years' familiar\nexperience with New York's, (perhaps the world's) great thoroughfare,\nBroadway, and possess to some extent a personal and saunterer's\nknowledge of St. Charles street in New Orleans, Tremont street in\nBoston, and the broad trottoirs of Pennsylvania avenue in Washington. Of\ncourse it is a pity that Chestnut were not two or three times wider; but\nthe street, any fine day, shows vividness, motion, variety, not easily\nto be surpass'd. (Sparkling eyes, human faces, magnetism, well-dress'd\nwomen, ambulating to and fro--with lots o fine things in the\nwindows--are they not about the same, the civilized world over?)\n\n    How fast the flitting figures come!\n        The mild, the fierce, the stony face;\n    Some bright with thoughtless smiles--and some\n        Where secret tears have left their trace.\n\nA few days ago one of the six-story clothing stores along here had\nthe space inside its plate-glass show-window partition'd into a little\ncorral, and litter'd deeply with rich clover and hay, (I could smell the\nodor outside,) on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep, full-sized\nbut young--the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw. I stop's\nlong and long, with the crowd, to view them--one lying down chewing the\ncud, and one standing up, looking out, with dense-fringed patient\neyes. Their wool, of a clear tawny color, with streaks of glistening\nblack--altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of\ndandies, dollars and dry-goods.\n\n\nUP THE HUDSON TO ULSTER COUNTY\n\n_April 23._--Off to New York on a little tour and visit. Leaving the\nhospitable, home-like quarters of my valued friends, Mr. and Mrs. J. H.\nJohnston--took the 4 P. M. boat, bound up the Hudson, 100 miles or so.\nSunset and evening fine. Especially enjoy'd the hour after we passed\nCozzens's landing--the night lit by the crescent moon and Venus, now\nswimming in tender glory, and now hid by the high rocks and hills of the\nwestern shore, which we hugg'd close. (Where I spend the next ten days\nis in Ulster county and its neighborhood, with frequent morning and\nevening drives, observations of the river, and short rambles.)\n\n_April 24--Noon._--A little more and the sun would be oppressive. The\nbees are out gathering their bread from willows and other trees. I watch\nthem returning, darting through the air or lighting on the hives, their\nthighs covered with the yellow forage. A solitary robin sings near. I\nsit in my shirt sleeves and gaze from an open bay-window on the indolent\nscene--the thin haze, the Fishkill hills in the distance--off on\nthe river, a sloop with slanting mainsail, and two or three little\nshad-boats. Over on the railroad opposite, long freight trains,\nsometimes weighted by cylinder-tanks of petroleum, thirty, forty, fifty\ncars in a string, panting and rumbling along in full view, but the sound\nsoften'd by distance.\n\n\nDAYS AT J. B.'S TURF-FIRES--SPRING SONGS\n\n_April 26_.--At sunrise, the pure clear sound of the meadow lark. An\nhour later, some notes, few and simple, yet delicious and perfect, from\nthe bush-sparrow-towards noon the reedy trill of the robin. To-day is\nthe fairest, sweetest yet--penetrating warmth--a lovely veil in the air,\npartly heat-vapor and partly from the turf-fires everywhere in patches\non the farms. A group of soft maples near by silently bursts out in\ncrimson tips, buzzing all day with busy bees. The white sails of sloops\nand schooners glide up and down the river; and long trains of cars, with\nponderous roll, or faint bell notes, almost constantly on the opposite\nshore. The earliest wild flowers in the woods and fields, spicy arbutus,\nblue liverwort, frail anemone, and the pretty white blossoms of the\nbloodroot. I launch out in slow rambles, discovering them. As I go along\nthe roads I like to see the farmers' fires in patches, burning the dry\nbrush, turf, debris. How the smoke crawls along, flat to the ground,\nslanting, slowly rising, reaching away, and at last dissipating. I like\nits acrid smell--whiffs just reaching me--welcomer than French perfume.\n\nThe birds are plenty; of any sort, or of two or three sorts, curiously,\nnot a sign, till suddenly some warm, gushing, sunny April (or even\nMarch) day--lo! there they are, from twig to twig, or fence to fence,\nflirting, singing, some mating, preparing to build. But most of them _en\npassant_--a fortnight, a month in these parts, and then away. As in all\nphases, Nature keeps up her vital, copious, eternal procession. Still,\nplenty of the birds hang around all or most of the season--now their\nlove-time, and era of nest-building. I find flying over the river,\ncrows, gulls and hawks. I hear the afternoon shriek of the latter,\ndarting about, preparing to nest. The oriole will soon be heard here,\nand the twanging _meoeow_ of the cat-bird; also the king-bird, cuckoo\nand the warblers. All along, there are three peculiarly characteristic\nspring songs--the meadow-lark's, so sweet, so alert and remonstrating\n(as if he said, \"don't you see?\" or, \"can't you understand?\")--the\ncheery, mellow, human tones of the robin--(I have been trying for years\nto get a brief term, or phrase, that would identify and describe that\nrobin call)--and the amorous whistle of the high-hole. Insects are out\nplentifully at midday.\n\n_April 29_.--As we drove lingering along the road we heard, just after\nsundown, the song of the wood-thrush. We stopp'd without a word, and\nlisten'd long. The delicious notes--a sweet, artless, voluntary, simple\nanthem, as from the flute-stops of some organ, wafted through the\ntwilight--echoing well to us from the perpendicular high rock, where, in\nsome thick young trees' recesses at the base, sat the bird--fill'd our\nsenses, our souls.\n\n\nMEETING A HERMIT\n\nI found in one of my rambles up the hills a real hermit, living in a\nlonesome spot, hard to get at, rocky, the view fine, with a little patch\nof land two rods square. A man of youngish middle age, city born and\nraised, had been to school, had travel'd in Europe and California. I\nfirst met him once or twice on the road, and pass'd the time of day,\nwith some small talk; then, the third time, he ask'd me to go along a\nbit and rest in his hut (an almost unprecedented compliment, as I heard\nfrom others afterwards.) He was of Quaker stock, I think; talk'd with\nease and moderate freedom, but did not unbosom his life, or story, or\ntragedy, or whatever it was.\n\n\nAN ULSTER COUNTY WATERFALL\n\nI jot this mem, in a wild scene of woods and hills, where we have come\nto visit a waterfall. I never saw finer or more copious hemlocks, many\nof them large, some old and hoary. Such a sentiment to them, secretive,\nshaggy--what I call weather-beaten and let-alone--a rich underlay of\nferns, yew sprouts and mosses, beginning to be spotted with the early\nsummer wild-flowers. Enveloping all, the monotone and liquid gurgle\nfrom the hoarse impetuous copious fall--the greenish-tawny, darkly\ntransparent waters, plunging with velocity down the rocks, with patches\nof milk-white foam--a stream of hurrying amber, thirty feet wide, risen\nfar back in the hills and woods, now rushing with volume--every hundred\nrods a fall, and sometimes three or four in that distance. A primitive\nforest, druidical, solitary and savage--not ten visitors a year--broken\nrocks everywhere--shade overhead, thick underfoot with leaves--a just\npalpable wild and delicate aroma.\n\n\nWALTER DUMONT AND HIS MEDAL\n\nAs I saunter'd along the high road yesterday, I stopp'd to watch a man\nnear by, ploughing a rough stony field with a yoke of oxen. Usually\nthere is much geeing and hawing, excitement, and continual noise and\nexpletives, about a job of this kind. But I noticed how different,\nhow easy and wordless, yet firm and sufficient, the work of this young\nploughman. His name was Walter Dumont, a farmer, and son of a farmer,\nworking for their living. Three years ago, when the steamer \"Sunnyside\"\nwas wreck'd of a bitter icy night on the west bank here, Walter went\nout in his boat--was the first man on hand with assistance--made a\nway through the ice to shore, connected a line, perform'd work of\nfirst-class readiness, daring, danger, and saved numerous lives. Some\nweeks after, one evening when he was up at Esopus, among the usual\nloafing crowd at the country store and post-office, there arrived\nthe gift of an unexpected official gold medal for the quiet hero. The\nimpromptu presentation was made to him on the spot, but he blush'd,\nhesitated as he took it, and had nothing to say.\n\n\nHUDSON RIVER SIGHTS\n\nIt was a happy thought to build the Hudson river railroad right\nalong the shore. The grade is already made by nature; you are sure of\nventilation one side--and you are in nobody's way. I see, hear, the\nlocomotives and cars, rumbling, roaring, flaming, smoking, constantly,\naway off there, night and day--less than a mile distant, and in full\nview by day. I like both sight and sound. Express trains thunder and\nlighten along; of freight trains, most of them very long, there cannot\nbe less than a hundred a day. At night far down you see the headlight\napproaching, coming steadily on like a meteor. The river at night has\nits special character-beauties. The shad fishermen go forth in their\nboats and pay out their nets--one sitting forward, rowing, and one\nstanding up aft dropping it properly-marking the line with little\nfloats bearing candles, conveying, as they glide over the water, an\nindescribable sentiment and doubled brightness. I like to watch the tows\nat night, too, with their twinkling lamps, and hear the husky panting\nof the steamers; or catch the sloops' and schooners' shadowy forms, like\nphantoms, white, silent, indefinite, out there. Then the Hudson of a\nclear moonlight night.\n\nBut there is one sight the very grandest. Sometimes in the fiercest\ndriving storm of wind, rain, hail or snow, a great eagle will appear\nover the river, now soaring with steady and now overbended wings--always\nconfronting the gale, or perhaps cleaving into, or at times literally\n_sitting_ upon it. It is like reading some first-class natural tragedy\nor epic, or hearing martial trumpets. The splendid bird enjoys the\nhubbub--is adjusted and equal to it--finishes it so artistically.\nHis pinions just oscillating--the position of his head and neck--his\nresistless, occasionally varied flight--now a swirl, now an upward\nmovement--the black clouds driving--the angry wash below--the hiss\nof rain, the wind's piping (perhaps the ice colliding, grunting)--he\ntacking or jibing--now, as it were, for a change, abandoning himself to\nthe gale, moving with it with such velocity--and now, resuming control,\nhe comes up against it, lord of the situation and the storm--lord, amid\nit, of power and savage joy.\n\nSometimes (as at present writing,) middle of sunny afternoon, the\nold \"Vanderbilt\" steamer stalking ahead--I plainly hear her rhythmic,\nslushing paddles--drawing by long hawsers an immense and varied\nfollowing string, (\"an old sow and pigs,\" the river folks call it.)\nFirst comes a big barge, with a house built on it, and spars towering\nover the roof; then canal boats, a lengthen'd, clustering train,\nfasten'd and link'd together--the one in the middle, with high staff,\nflaunting a broad and gaudy flag--others with the almost invariable\nlines of new-wash'd clothes, drying; two sloops and a schooner aside the\ntow--little wind, and that adverse--with three long, dark, empty barges\nbringing up the rear. People are on the boats: men lounging, women in\nsun-bonnets, children, stovepipes with streaming smoke.\n\n\nTWO CITY AREAS, CERTAIN HOURS\n\nNEW YORK, _May 24, '79_.--Perhaps no quarters of this city (I have\nreturn'd again for awhile,) make more brilliant, animated, crowded,\nspectacular human presentations these fine May afternoons than the two\nI am now going to describe from personal observation. First: that\narea comprising Fourteenth street (especially the short range between\nBroadway and Fifth avenue) with Union square, its adjacencies, and so\nretrostretching down Broadway for half a mile. All the walks here are\nwide, and the spaces ample and free--now flooded with liquid gold from\nthe last two hours of powerful sunshine. The whole area at 5 o'clock,\nthe days of my observations, must have contain'd from thirty to\nforty thousand finely-dress'd people, all in motion, plenty of them\ngood-looking, many beautiful women, often youths and children,\nthe latter in groups with their nurses--the trottoirs everywhere\nclose-spread, thick-tangled, (yet no collision, no trouble,) with masses\nof bright color, action, and tasty toilets; (surely the women dress\nbetter than ever before, and the men do too.) As if New York would show\nthese afternoons what it can do in its humanity, its choicest physique\nand physiognomy, and its countless prodigality of locomotion, dry goods,\nglitter, magnetism, and happiness.\n\nSecond: also from 5 to 7 P.M. the stretch of Fifth avenue, all the way\nfrom the Central Park exits at Fifty-ninth street, down to Fourteenth,\nespecially along the high grade by Fortieth street, and down the hill.\nA Mississippi of horses and rich vehicles, not by dozens and scores, but\nhundreds and thousands--the broad avenue filled and cramm'd with them--a\nmoving, sparkling, hurrying crush, for more than two miles. (I wonder\nthey don't get block'd, but I believe they never do.) Altogether it is\nto me the marvel sight of New York. I like to get in one of the Fifth\navenue stages and ride up, stemming the swift-moving procession. I doubt\nif London or Paris or any city in the world can show such a carriage\ncarnival as I have seen here five or six times these beautiful May\nafternoons.\n\n\nCENTRAL PARK WALKS AND TALKS\n\n_May 16 to 22_.--I visit Central Park now almost every day, sitting,\nor slowly rambling, or riding around. The whole place presents its very\nbest appearance this current month--the full flush of the trees, the\nplentiful white and pink of the flowering shrubs, the emerald green of\nthe grass spreading everywhere, yellow dotted still with dandelions--the\nspecialty of the plentiful gray rocks, peculiar to these grounds,\ncropping out, miles and miles--and over all the beauty and purity,\nthree days out of four, of our summer skies. As I sit, placidly,\nearly afternoon, off against Ninetieth street, the policeman, C. C., a\nwell-form'd sandy-complexion'd young fellow, comes over and stands near\nme. We grow quite friendly and chatty forth-with. He is a New Yorker\nborn and raised, and in answer to my questions tells me about the life\nof a New York Park policeman, (while he talks keeping his eyes and ears\nvigilantly open, occasionally pausing and moving where he can get full\nviews of the vistas of the road, up and down, and the spaces around.)\nThe pay is $2.40 a day (seven days to a week)--the men come on and work\neight hours straight ahead, which is all that is required of them out of\nthe twenty-four. The position has more risks than one might suppose--for\ninstance if a team or horse runs away (which happens daily) each man is\nexpected not only to be prompt, but to waive safety and stop wildest nag\nor nags--(_do it_, and don't be thinking of your bones or face)--give\nthe alarm-whistle too, so that other guards may repeat, and the vehicles\nup and down the tracks be warn'd. Injuries to the men are continually\nhappening. There is much alertness and quiet strength. (Few appreciate,\nI have often thought, the Ulyssean capacity, derring do, quick readiness\nin emergencies, practicality, unwitting devotion and heroism, among\nour American young men and working-people--the firemen, the railroad\nemployes, the steamer and ferry men, the police, the conductors and\ndrivers--the whole splendid average of native stock, city and country.)\nIt is good work, though; and upon the whole, the Park force members like\nit. They see life, and the excitement keeps them up. There is not so\nmuch difficulty as might be supposed from tramps, roughs, or in keeping\npeople \"off the grass.\" The worst trouble of the regular Park employe is\nfrom malarial fever, chills, and the like.\n\n\nA FINE AFTERNOON, 4 TO 6\n\nTen thousand vehicles careering through the Park this perfect afternoon.\nSuch a show! and I have seen all--watch'd it narrowly, and at\nmy leisure. Private barouches, cabs and coupes, some fine\nhorseflesh--lapdogs, footmen, fashions, foreigners, cockades on hats,\ncrests on panels--the full oceanic tide of New York's wealth and\n\"gentility.\" It was an impressive, rich, interminable circus on a grand\nscale, full of action and color in the beauty of the day, under\nthe clear sun and moderate breeze. Family groups, couples, single\ndrivers--of course dresses generally elegant--much \"style,\" (yet perhaps\nlittle or nothing, even in that direction, that fully justified itself.)\nThrough the windows of two or three of the richest carriages I saw\nfaces almost corpse-like, so ashy and listless. Indeed the whole affair\nexhibited less of sterling America, either in spirit or countenance,\nthan I had counted on from such a select mass-spectacle. I suppose, as\na proof of limitless wealth, leisure, and the aforesaid \"gentility,\" it\nwas tremendous. Yet what I saw those hours (I took two other occasions,\ntwo other afternoons to watch the same scene,) confirms a thought that\nhaunts me every additional glimpse I get of our top-loftical general or\nrather exceptional phases of wealth and fashion in this country--namely,\nthat they are ill at ease, much too conscious, cased in too many\ncerements, and far from happy--that there is nothing in them which\nwe who are poor and plain need at all envy, and that instead of the\nperennial smell of the grass and woods and shores, their typical\nredolence is of soaps and essences, very rare may be, but suggesting the\nbarber shop--something that turns stale and musty in a few hours anyhow.\n\nPerhaps the show on the horseback road was prettiest. Many groups\n(threes a favorite number,) some couples, some singly--many\nladies--frequently horses or parties dashing along on a full run--fine\nriding the rule--a few really first-class animals. As the afternoon\nwaned, the wheel'd carriages grew less, but the saddle-riders seemed to\nincrease. They linger'd long--and I saw some charming forms and faces.\n\n\nDEPARTING OF THE BIG STEAMERS\n\n_May 25._--A three hours' bay-trip from 12 to 3 this afternoon,\naccompanying \"the City of Brussels\" down as far as the Narrows, in\nbehoof of some Europe-bound friends, to give them a good send off.\nOur spirited little tug, the \"Seth Low,\" kept close to the great black\n\"Brussels,\" sometimes one side, sometimes the other, always up to her,\nor even pressing ahead, (like the blooded pony accompanying the\nroyal elephant.) The whole affair, from the first, was an animated,\nquick-passing, characteristic New York scene; the large, good-looking,\nwell-dress'd crowd on the wharf-end--men and women come to see their\nfriends depart, and bid them God-speed--the ship's sides swarming with\npassengers--groups of bronze-faced sailors, with uniform' d officers at\ntheir posts--the quiet directions, as she quickly unfastens and moves\nout, prompt to a minute--the emotional faces, adieus and fluttering\nhandkerchiefs, and many smiles and some tears on the wharf--the\nanswering faces, smiles, tears and fluttering handkerchiefs, from the\nship--(what can be subtler and finer than this play of faces on\nsuch occasions in these responding crowds?--what go more to one's\nheart?)--the proud, steady, noiseless cleaving of the grand oceaner\ndown the bay--we speeding by her side a few miles, and then turning,\nwheeling,--amid a babel of wild hurrahs, shouted partings, ear-splitting\nsteam whistles, kissing of hands and waving of handkerchiefs.\n\nThis departing of the big steamers, noons or afternoons--there is no\nbetter medicine when one is listless or vapory. I am fond of going down\nWednesdays and Saturdays--their more special days--to watch them and the\ncrowds on the wharves, the arriving passengers, the general bustle and\nactivity, the eager looks from the faces, the clear-toned voices, (a\ntravel'd foreigner, a musician, told me the other day she thinks an\nAmerican crowd has the finest voices in the world,) the whole look of\nthe great, shapely black ships themselves, and their groups and lined\nsides--in the setting of our bay with the blue sky overhead. Two days\nafter the above I saw the \"Britannic,\" the \"Donau,\" the \"Helvetia\" and\nthe \"Schiedam\" steam out, all off for Europe--a magnificent sight.\n\n\nTWO HOURS ON THE MINNESOTA\n\nFrom 7 to 9, aboard the United States school-ship Minnesota, lying up\nthe North river. Captain Luce sent his gig for us about sundown, to the\nfoot of Twenty-third street, and receiv'd us aboard with officer-like\nhospitality and sailor heartiness. There are several hundred youths on\nthe Minnesota to be train'd for efficiently manning the government navy.\nI like the idea much; and, so far as I have seen to-night, I like the\nway it is carried out on this huge vessel. Below, on the gun-deck, were\ngather'd nearly a hundred of the boys, to give us some of their singing\nexercises, with a melodeon accompaniment, play'd by one of their number.\nThey sang with a will. The best part, however, was the sight of the\nyoung fellows themselves. I went over among them before the singing\nbegan, and talk'd a few minutes informally. They are from all the\nStates; I asked for the Southerners, but could only find one, a lad from\nBaltimore. In age, apparently, they range from about fourteen years to\nnineteen or twenty. They are all of American birth, and have to pass a\nrigid medical examination; well-grown youths, good flesh, bright eyes,\nlooking straight at you, healthy, intelligent, not a slouch among them,\nnor a menial--in every one the promise of a man. I have been to many\npublic aggregations of young and old, and of schools and colleges, in\nmy day, but I confess I have never been so near satisfied, so comforted,\n(both from the fact of the school itself, and the splendid proof of our\ncountry, our composite race, and the sample-promises of its good average\ncapacities, its future,) as in the collection from all parts of the\nUnited States on this navy training ship. (\"Are there going to be _any\nmen_ there?\" was the dry and pregnant reply of Emerson to one who had\nbeen crowding him with the rich material statistics and possibilities of\nsome western or Pacific region.)\n\n_May 26_.--Aboard the Minnesota again. Lieut. Murphy kindly came for\nme in his boat. Enjoy'd specially those brief trips to and fro--the\nsailors, tann'd, strong, so bright and able-looking, pulling their oars\nin long side-swing, man-of-war style, as they row'd me across. I saw\nthe boys in companies drilling with small arms; had a talk with Chaplain\nRawson. At 11 o'clock all of us gathered to breakfast around a long\ntable in the great ward room--I among the rest--a genial, plentiful,\nhospitable affair every way--plenty to eat, and of the best; became\nacquainted with several new officers. This second visit, with its\nobservations, talks, (two or three at random with the boys,) confirm'd\nmy first impressions.\n\n\nMATURE SUMMER DAYS AND NIGHTS\n\n_Aug. 4_.--Forenoon--as I sit under the willow shade, (have retreated\ndown in the country again,) a little bird is leisurely dousing and\nflirting himself amid the brook almost within reach of me. He evidently\nfears me not--takes me for some concomitant of the neighboring earthy\nbanks, free bushery and wild weeds. _6 p.m._--The last three days have\nbeen perfect ones for the season, (four nights ago copious rains, with\nvehement thunder and lightning.) I write this sitting by the creek\nwatching my two kingfishers at their sundown sport. The strong,\nbeautiful, joyous creatures! Their wings glisten in the slanted sunbeams\nas they circle and circle around, occasionally dipping and dashing the\nwater, and making long stretches up and down the creek. Wherever I go\nover fields, through lanes, in by-places, blooms the white-flowering\nwild-carrot, its delicate pat of snow-flakes crowning its slender stem,\ngracefully oscillating in the breeze,\n\n\nEXPOSITION BUILDING--NEW CITY HALL--RIVER TRIP\n\nPHILADELPHIA, _Aug. 26_.--Last night and to-night of unsurpass'd\nclearness, after two days' rain; moon splendor and star splendor. Being\nout toward the great Exposition building, West Philadelphia, I saw it\nlit up, and thought I would go in. There was a ball, democratic but\nnice; plenty of young couples waltzing and quadrilling--music by a good\nstring-band. To the sight and hearing of these--to moderate strolls up\nand down the roomy spaces--to getting off aside, resting in an arm-chair\nand looking up a long while at the grand high roof with its graceful and\nmultitudinous work of iron rods, angles, gray colors, plays of light and\nshade, receding into dim outlines--to absorbing (in the intervals of the\nstring band,) some capital voluntaries and rolling caprices from the big\norgan at the other end of the building--to sighting a shadow'd figure\nor group or couple of lovers every now and then passing some near or\nfarther aisle--I abandon'd myself for over an hour.\n\nReturning home, riding down Market street in an open summer car,\nsomething detain'd us between Fifteenth and Broad, and I got out to view\nbetter the new, three-fifths-built marble edifice, the City Hall,\nof magnificent proportions--a majestic and lovely show there in the\nmoonlight--flooded all over, facades, myriad silver-white lines and\ncarv'd heads and mouldings, with the soft dazzle--silent, weird,\nbeautiful--well, I know that never when finish'd will that magnificent\npile impress one as it impress'd me those fifteen minutes.\n\nTo-night, since, I have been long on the river. I watch the C-shaped\nNorthern Crown, (with the star Alshacca that blazed out so suddenly,\nalarmingly, one night a few years ago.) The moon in her third quarter,\nand up nearly all night. And there, as I look eastward, my long-absent\nPleiades, welcome again to sight. For an hour I enjoy the soothing and\nvital scene to the low splash of waves--new stars steadily, noiselessly\nrising in the east.\n\nAs I cross the Delaware, one of the deck-hands, F. R., tells me how\na woman jump'd overboard and was drown'd a couple of hours since. It\nhappen'd in mid-channel--she leap'd from the forward part of the boat,\nwhich went over her. He saw her rise on the other side in the swift\nrunning water, throw her arms and closed hands high up, (white hands\nand bare forearms in the moonlight like a flash,) and then she sank. (I\nfound out afterwards that this young fellow had promptly jump'd in, swam\nafter the poor creature, and made, though unsuccessfully, the bravest\nefforts to rescue her; but he didn't mention that part at all in telling\nme the story.)\n\n\nSWALLOWS ON THE RIVER\n\n_Sept. 3_--Cloudy and wet, and wind due east; air without palpable fog,\nbut very heavy with moisture--welcome for a change. Forenoon, crossing\nthe Delaware, I noticed unusual numbers of swallows in flight, circling,\ndarting, graceful beyond description, close to the water. Thick, around\nthe bows of the ferry-boat as she lay tied in her slip, they flew; and\nas we went out I watch'd beyond the pier-heads, and across the broad\nstream, their swift-winding loop-ribands of motion, down close to it,\ncutting and intersecting. Though I had seen swallows all my life, seem'd\nas though I never before realized their peculiar beauty and character in\nthe landscape. (Some time ago, for an hour, in a huge old country barn,\nwatching these birds flying, recall'd the 22d book of the Odyssey, where\nUlysses slays the suitors, bringing things to _eclaircissement_, and\nMinerva, swallow-bodied, darts up through the spaces of the hall, sits\nhigh on a beam, looks complacently on the show of slaughter, and feels\nin her element, exulting, joyous.)\n\n\nBEGIN A LONG JAUNT WEST\n\nThe following three or four months (Sept. to Dec. '79) I made quite a\nwestern journey, fetching up at Denver, Colorado, and penetrating the\nRocky Mountain region enough to get a good notion of it all. Left\nWest Philadelphia after 9 o'clock one night, middle of September, in a\ncomfortable sleeper. Oblivious of the two or three hundred miles across\nPennsylvania; at Pittsburgh in the morning to breakfast. Pretty good\nview of the city and Birmingham--fog and damp, smoke, coke-furnaces,\nflames, discolor'd wooden houses, and vast collections of coal-barges.\nPresently a bit of fine region, West Virginia, the Panhandle, and\ncrossing the river, the Ohio. By day through the latter State--then\nIndiana--and so rock'd to slumber for a second night, flying like\nlightning through Illinois.\n\n\nIN THE SLEEPER\n\nWhat a fierce weird pleasure to lie in my berth at night in the\nluxurious palace-car, drawn by the mighty Baldwin--embodying, and\nfilling me, too, full of the swiftest motion, and most resistless\nstrength! It is late, perhaps midnight or after--distances join'd like\nmagic--as we speed through Harrisburg, Columbus, Indianapolis. The\nelement of danger adds zest to it all. On we go, rumbling and flashing,\nwith our loud whinnies thrown out from time to time, or trumpet-blasts,\ninto the darkness. Passing the homes of men, the farms, barns,\ncattle--the silent villages. And the car itself, the sleeper, with\ncurtains drawn and lights turn'd down--in the berths the slumberers,\nmany of them women and children--as on, on, on, we fly like lightning\nthrough the night--how strangely sound and sweet they sleep! (They say\nthe French Voltaire in his time designated the grand opera and a ship of\nwar the most signal illustrations of the growth of humanity's and art's\nadvance beyond primitive barbarism. Perhaps if the witty philosopher\nwere here these days, and went in the same car with perfect bedding and\nfeed from New York to San Francisco, he would shift his type and sample\nto one of our American sleepers.)\n\n\nMISSOURI STATE\n\nWe should have made the run of 960 miles from Philadelphia to St. Louis\nin thirty-six hours, but we had a collision and bad locomotive smash\nabout two-thirds of the way, which set us back. So merely stopping over\nnight that time in St. Louis, I sped on westward. As I cross'd Missouri\nState the whole distance by the St. Louis and Kansas City Northern\nRailroad, a fine early autumn day, I thought my eyes had never looked on\nscenes of greater pastoral beauty. For over two hundred miles successive\nrolling prairies, agriculturally perfect view'd by Pennsylvania and New\nJersey eyes, and dotted here and there with fine timber. Yet fine as the\nland is, it isn't the finest portion; (there is a bed of impervious clay\nand hard-pan beneath this section that holds water too firmly, \"drowns\nthe land in wet weather, and bakes it in dry,\" as a cynical farmer told\nme.) South are some richer tracts, though perhaps the beauty-spots of\nthe State are the northwestern counties. Altogether, I am clear, (now,\nand from what I have seen and learn'd since,) that Missouri, in climate,\nsoil, relative situation, wheat, grass, mines, railroads, and every\nimportant materialistic respect, stands in the front rank of the Union.\nOf Missouri averaged politically and socially I have heard all sorts of\ntalk, some pretty severe--but I should have no fear myself of getting\nalong safely and comfortably anywhere among the Missourians. They raise\na good deal of tobacco. You see at this time quantities of the light\ngreenish-gray leaves pulled and hanging out to dry on temporary\nframeworks or rows of sticks. Looks much like the mullein familiar to\neastern eyes.\n\n\nLAWRENCE AND TOPEKA, KANSAS\n\nWe thought of stopping in Kansas City, but when we got there we found\na train ready and a crowd of hospitable Kansians to take us on to\nLawrence, to which I proceeded. I shall not soon forget my good days\nin L., in company with Judge Usher and his sons, (especially John and\nLinton,) true westerners of the noblest type. Nor the similar days in\nTopeka. Nor the brotherly kindness of my RR. friends there, and the\ncity and State officials. Lawrence and Topeka are large, bustling,\nhalf-rural, handsome cities. I took two or three long drives about the\nlatter, drawn by a spirited team over smooth roads.\n\n\nTHE PRAIRIES (_and an Undeliver'd Speech_)\n\nAt a large popular meeting at Topeka--the Kansas State Silver Wedding,\nfifteen or twenty thousand people--I had been erroneously bill'd\nto deliver a poem. As I seem'd to be made much of, and wanted to be\ngood-natured, I hastily pencill'd out the following little speech.\nUnfortunately, (or fortunately,) I had such a good time and rest, and\ntalk and dinner, with the U. boys, that I let the hours slip away and\ndidn't drive over to the meeting and speak my piece. But here it is just\nthe same:\n\n\"My friends, your bills announce me as giving a poem; but I have no\npoem--have composed none for this occasion. And I can honestly say I am\nnow glad of it. Under these skies resplendent in September beauty--amid\nthe peculiar landscape you are used to, but which is new to me--these\ninterminable and stately prairies--in the freedom and vigor and sane\nenthusiasm of this perfect western air and autumn sunshine--it seems\nto me a poem would be almost an impertinence. But if you care to have a\nword from me, I should speak it about these very prairies; they impress\nme most, of all the objective shows I see or have seen on this, my first\nreal visit to the West. As I have roll'd rapidly hither for more than\na thousand miles, through fair Ohio, through bread-raising Indiana and\nIllinois--through ample Missouri, that contains and raises everything;\nas I have partially explor'd your charming city during the last two\ndays, and, standing on Oread hill, by the university, have launch'd my\nview across broad expanses of living green, in every direction--I have\nagain been most impress'd, I say, and shall remain for the rest of my\nlife most impress'd, with that feature of the topography of your western\ncentral world--that vast Something, stretching out on its own unbounded\nscale, unconfined, which there is in these prairies, combining the real\nand ideal, and beautiful as dreams.\n\n\"I wonder indeed if the people of this continental inland West know how\nmuch of first-class _art_ they have in these prairies--how original and\nall your own--how much of the influences of a character for your future\nhumanity, broad, patriotic, heroic and new? how entirely they tally on\nland the grandeur and superb monotony of the skies of heaven, and the\nocean with its waters? how freeing, soothing, nourishing they are to the\nsoul?\n\n\"Then is it not subtly they who have given us our leading modern\nAmericans, Lincoln and Grant?--vast-spread, average men--their\nforegrounds of character altogether practical and real, yet (to those\nwho have eyes to see) with finest backgrounds of the ideal, towering\nhigh as any. And do we not see, in them, foreshadowings of the future\nraces that shall fill these prairies?\n\n\"Not but what the Yankee and Atlantic States, and every other\npart--Texas, and the States flanking the south-east and the Gulf of\nMexico--the Pacific shore empire--the Territories and Lakes, and the\nCanada line (the day is not yet, but it will come, including Canada\nentire)--are equally and integrally and indissolubly this Nation, the\n_sine qua non_ of the human, political and commercial New World. But\nthis favor'd central area of (in round numbers) two thousand miles\nsquare seems fated to be the home both of what I would call America's\ndistinctive ideas and distinctive realities.\"\n\n\nON TO DENVER--A FRONTIER INCIDENT\n\nThe jaunt of five or six hundred miles from Topeka to Denver took me\nthrough a variety of country, but all unmistakably prolific, western,\nAmerican, and on the largest scale. For a long distance we follow the\nline of the Kansas river, (I like better the old name, Kaw,) a stretch\nof very rich, dark soil, famed for its wheat, and call'd the Golden\nBelt--then plains and plains, hour after hour--Ellsworth county, the\ncentre of the State--where I must stop a moment to tell a characteristic\nstory of early days--scene the very spot where I am passing--time 1868.\nIn a scrimmage at some public gathering in the town, A. had shot\nB. quite badly, but had not kill'd him. The sober men of Ellsworth\nconferr'd with one another and decided that A. deserv'd punishment. As\nthey wished to set a good example and establish their reputation the\nreverse of a Lynching town, they open an informal court and bring both\nmen before them for deliberate trial. Soon as this trial begins the\nwounded man is led forward to give his testimony. Seeing his enemy\nin durance and unarm'd, B. walks suddenly up in a fury and shoots A.\nthrough the head--shoots him dead. The court is instantly adjourn'd, and\nits unanimous members, without a word of debate, walk the murderer B.\nout, wounded as he is, and hang him.\n\nIn due time we reach Denver, which city I fall in love with from the\nfirst, and have that feeling confirm'd, the longer I stay there. One of\nmy pleasantest days was a jaunt, via Platte canon, to Leadville.\n\n\nAN HOUR ON KENOSHA SUMMIT\n\nJottings from the Rocky Mountains, mostly pencill'd during a day's trip\nover the South Park RR., returning from Leadville, and especially the\nhour we were detain'd, (much to my satisfaction,) at Kenosha summit. As\nafternoon advances, novelties, far-reaching splendors, accumulate under\nthe bright sun in this pure air. But I had better commence with the day.\n\nThe confronting of Platte canon just at dawn, after a ten miles' ride in\nearly darkness on the rail from Denver--the seasonable stoppage at\nthe entrance of the canon, and good breakfast of eggs, trout, and nice\ngriddle-cakes--then as we travel on, and get well in the gorge, all the\nwonders, beauty, savage power of the scene--the wild stream of water,\nfrom sources of snows, brawling continually in sight one side--the\ndazzling sun, and the morning lights on the rocks--such turns and\ngrades in the track, squirming around corners, or up and down hills--far\nglimpses of a hundred peaks, titanic necklaces, stretching north and\nsouth--the huge rightly-named Dome-rock--and as we dash along, others\nsimilar, simple, monolithic, elephantine.\n\n\nAN EGOTISTICAL \"FIND\"\n\n\"I have found the law of my own poems,\" was the unspoken but\nmore-and-more decided feeling that came to me as I pass'd, hour after\nhour, amid all this grim yet joyous elemental abandon--this plenitude\nof material, entire absence of art, untrammel'd play of primitive\nNature--the chasm, the gorge, the crystal mountain stream,\nrepeated scores, hundreds of miles--the broad handling and absolute\nuncrampedness--the fantastic forms, bathed in transparent browns, faint\nreds and grays, towering sometimes a thousand, sometimes two or three\nthousand feet high--at their tops now and then huge masses pois'd, and\nmixing with the clouds, with only their outlines, hazed in misty lilac,\nvisible. (\"In Nature's grandest shows,\" says an old Dutch writer, an\necclesiastic, \"amid the ocean's depth, if so might be, or countless\nworlds rolling above at night, a man thinks of them, weighs all, not for\nthemselves or the abstract, but with reference to his own personality,\nand how they may affect him or color his destinies.\")\n\n\nNEW SENSES: NEW JOYS\n\nWe follow the stream of amber and bronze brawling along its bed,\nwith its frequent cascades and snow-white foam. Through the canon we\nfly--mountains not only each side, but seemingly, till we get near,\nright in front of us--every rood a new view flashing, and each flash\ndefying description--on the almost perpendicular sides, clinging\npines, cedars, spruces, crimson sumach bushes, spots of wild grass--but\ndominating all, those towering rocks, rocks, rocks, bathed in delicate\nvari-colors, with the clear sky of autumn overhead. New senses, new\njoys, seem develop'd. Talk as you like, a typical Rocky Mountain canon,\nor a limitless sea-like stretch of the great Kansas or Colorado plains,\nunder favoring circumstances, tallies, perhaps expresses, certainly\nawakes, those grandest and subtlest element-emotions in the human\nsoul, that all the marble temples and sculptures from Phidias to\nThorwaldsen--all paintings, poems, reminiscences, or even music,\nprobably never can.\n\n\nSTEAM-POWER, TELEGRAPHS, ETC\n\nI get out on a ten minutes' stoppage at Deer creek, to enjoy the\nunequal'd combination of hill, stone and wood. As we speed again,\nthe yellow granite in the sunshine, with natural spires, minarets,\ncastellated perches far aloft--then long stretches of straight-upright\npalisades, rhinoceros color--then gamboge and tinted chromos. Ever\nthe best of my pleasures the cool-fresh Colorado atmosphere, yet\nsufficiently warm. Signs of man's restless advent and pioneerage, hard\nas Nature's face is--deserted dug-outs by dozens in the side-hills--the\nscantling-hut, the telegraph-pole, the smoke of some impromptu chimney\nor outdoor fire--at intervals little settlements of log-houses, or\nparties of surveyors or telegraph builders, with their comfortable\ntents. Once, a canvas office where you could send a message by\nelectricity anywhere around the world! Yes, pronounc'd signs of the man\nof latest dates, dauntlessly grappling with these grisliest shows of the\nold kosmos. At several places steam saw-mills, with their piles of logs\nand boards, and the pipes puffing. Occasionally Platte canon expanding\ninto a grassy flat of a few acres. At one such place, toward the end,\nwhere we stop, and I get out to stretch my legs, as I look skyward, or\nrather mountain-topward, a huge hawk or eagle (a rare sight here) is\nidly soaring, balancing along the ether, now sinking low and coming\nquite near, and then up again in stately-languid circles--then higher,\nhigher, slanting to the north, and gradually out of sight.\n\n\nAMERICA'S BACK-BONE\n\nI jot these lines literally at Kenosha summit, where we return,\nafternoon, and take a long rest, 10,000 feet above sea-level. At\nthis immense height the South Park stretches fifty miles before me.\nMountainous chains and peaks in every variety of perspective, every hue\nof vista, fringe the view, in nearer, or middle, or far-dim distance,\nor fade on the horizon. We have now reach'd, penetrated the Rockies,\n(Hayden calls it the Front Range,) for a hundred miles or so; and though\nthese chains spread away in every direction, specially north and south,\nthousands and thousands farther, I have seen specimens of the utmost\nof them, and know henceforth at least what they are, and what they look\nlike. Not themselves alone, for they typify stretches and areas of half\nthe globe--are, in fact, the vertebrae or back-bone of our hemisphere.\nAs the anatomists say a man is only a spine, topp'd, footed, breasted\nand radiated, so the whole Western world is, in a sense, but an\nexpansion of these mountains. In South America they are the Andes, in\nCentral America and Mexico the Cordilleras, and in our States they\ngo under different names--in California the Coast and Cascade\nranges--thence more eastwardly the Sierra Nevadas--but mainly and more\ncentrally here the Rocky Mountains proper, with many an elevation such\nas Lincoln's, Grey's, Harvard's, Yale's, Long's and Pike's peaks, all\nover 14,000 feet high. (East, the highest peaks of the Alleghanies, the\nAdirondacks, the Catskills, and the White Mountains, range from 2000 to\n5500 feet-only Mount Washington, in the latter, 6300 feet.)\n\n\nTHE PARKS\n\nIn the midst of all here, lie such beautiful contrasts as the sunken\nbasins of the North, Middle, and South Parks, (the latter I am now on\none side of, and overlooking,) each the size of a large, level, almost\nquandrangular, grassy, western county, wall'd in by walls of hills, and\neach park the source of a river. The ones I specify are the largest in\nColorado, but the whole of that State, and of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and\nwestern California, through their sierras and ravines, are copiously\nmark'd by similar spreads and openings, many of the small ones of\nparadisiac loveliness and perfection, with their offsets of mountains,\nstreams, atmosphere and hues beyond compare.\n\n\nART FEATURES\n\nTalk, I say again, of going to Europe, of visiting the ruins of feudal\ncastles, or Coliseum remains, or kings' palaces--when you can come\n_here_. The alternations one gets, too; after the Illinois and Kansas\nprairies of a thousand miles--smooth and easy areas of the corn and\nwheat of ten million democratic farms in the future----here start up in\nevery conceivable presentation of shape, these non-utilitarian piles,\ncoping the skies, emanating a beauty, terror, power, more than Dante\nor Angelo ever knew. Yes, I think the chyle of not only poetry and\npainting, but oratory, and even the metaphysics and music fit for the\nNew World, before being finally assimilated, need first and feeding\nvisits here.\n\n_Mountain streams._--The spiritual contrast and etheriality of the whole\nregion consist largely to me in its never-absent peculiar streams--the\nsnows of inaccessible upper areas melting and running down through the\ngorges continually. Nothing like the water of pastoral plains, or creeks\nwith wooded banks and turf, or anything of the kind elsewhere. The\nshapes that element takes in the shows of the globe cannot be fully\nunderstood by an artist until he has studied these unique rivulets.\n\n_Aerial effects._--But perhaps as I gaze around me the rarest sight\nof all is in atmospheric hues. The prairies--as I cross'd them in my\njourney hither--and these mountains and parks, seem to me to afford\nnew lights and shades. Everywhere the aerial gradations and sky-effects\ninimitable; nowhere else such perspectives, such transparent lilacs\nand grays. I can conceive of some superior landscape painter, some fine\ncolorist, after sketching awhile out here, discarding all his previous\nwork, delightful to stock exhibition amateurs, as muddy, raw and\nartificial. Near one's eye ranges an infinite variety; high up, the bare\nwhitey-brown, above timber line; in certain spots afar patches of snow\nany time of year; (no trees, no flowers, no birds, at those chilling\naltitudes.) As I write I see the Snowy Range through the blue mist,\nbeautiful and far off, I plainly see the patches of snow.\n\n\nDENVER IMPRESSIONS\n\nThrough the long-lingering half-light of the most superb of evenings\nwe return'd to Denver, where I staid several days leisurely exploring,\nreceiving impressions, with which I may as well taper off this\nmemorandum, itemizing what I saw there. The best was the men,\nthree-fourths of them large, able, calm, alert, American. And cash! why\nthey create it here. Out in the smelting works, (the biggest and most\nimprov'd ones, for the precious metals, in the world,) I saw long rows\nof vats, pans, cover'd by bubbling-boiling water, and fill'd with pure\nsilver, four or five inches thick, many thousand dollars' worth in a\npan. The foreman who was showing me shovel'd it carelessly up with a\nlittle wooden shovel, as one might toss beans. Then large silver bricks,\nworth $2000 a brick, dozens of piles, twenty in a pile. In one place\nin the mountains, at a mining camp, I had a few days before seen rough\nbullion on the ground in the open air, like the confectioner's pyramids\nat some swell dinner in New York. (Such a sweet morsel to roll over with\na poor author's pen and ink--and appropriate to slip in here--that\nthe silver product of Colorado and Utah, with the gold product of\nCalifornia, New Mexico, Nevada and Dakota, foots up an addition to the\nworld's coin of considerably over a hundred millions every year.)\n\nA city, this Denver, well-laid out--Laramie street, and 15th and 16th\nand Champa streets, with others, particularly fine--some with tall\nstorehouses of stone or iron, and windows of plate-glass--all the\nstreets with little canals of mountain water running along the\nsides--plenty of people, \"business,\" modernness--yet not without a\ncertain racy wild smack, all its own. A place of fast horses, (many\nmares with their colts,) and I saw lots of big greyhounds for antelope\nhunting. Now and then groups of miners, some just come in, some starting\nout, very picturesque.\n\nOne of the papers here interview'd me, and reported me as saying\noff-hand: \"I have lived in or visited all the great cities on the\nAtlantic third of the republic--Boston, Brooklyn with its hills, New\nOrleans, Baltimore, stately Washington, broad Philadelphia, teeming\nCincinnati and Chicago, and for thirty years in that wonder, wash'd by\nhurried and glittering tides, my own New York, not only the New World's\nbut the world's city--but, newcomer to Denver as I am, and threading\nits streets, breathing its air, warm'd by its sunshine, and having what\nthere is of its human as well as aerial ozone flash'd upon me now for\nonly three or four days, I am very much like a man feels sometimes\ntoward certain people he meets with, and warms to, and hardly knows why.\nI, too, can hardly tell why, but as I enter'd the city in the slight\nhaze of a late September afternoon, and have breath'd its air, and\nslept well o' nights, and have roam'd or rode leisurely, and watch'd the\ncomers and goers at the hotels, and absorb'd the climatic magnetism of\nthis curiously attractive region, there has steadily grown upon me a\nfeeling of affection for the spot, which, sudden as it is, has become so\ndefinite and strong that I must put it on record.\"\n\nSo much for my feeling toward the Queen city of the plains and peaks,\nwhere she sits in her delicious rare atmosphere, over 5000 feet above\nsea-level, irrigated by mountain streams, one way looking east over\nthe prairies for a thousand miles, and having the other, westward,\nin constant view by day, draped in their violet haze, mountain tops\ninnumerable. Yes, I fell in love with Denver, and even felt a wish to\nspend my declining and dying days there.\n\n\nI TURN SOUTH AND THEN EAST AGAIN\n\nLeave Denver at 8 A.M. by the Rio Grande RR. going south. Mountains\nconstantly in sight in the apparently near distance, veil'd slightly,\nbut still clear and very grand--their cones, colors, sides, distinct\nagainst the sky--hundreds, it seem'd thousands, interminable necklaces\nof them, their tops and slopes hazed more or less slightly in that\nblue-gray, under the autumn sun, for over a hundred miles--the most\nspiritual show of objective Nature I ever beheld, or ever thought\npossible. Occasionally the light strengthens, making a contrast of\nyellow-tinged silver on one side, with dark and shaded gray on the\nother. I took a long look at Pike's peak, and was a little disappointed.\n(I suppose I had expected something stunning.) Our view over plains\nto the left stretches amply, with corrals here and there, the frequent\ncactus and wild sage, and herds of cattle feeding. Thus about 120\nmiles to Pueblo. At that town we board the comfortable and well-equipt\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe RR., now striking east.\n\n\nUNFULFILLED WANTS--THE ARKANSAS RIVER\n\nI had wanted to go to the Yellowstone river region--wanted specially to\nsee the National Park, and the geysers and the \"hoodoo\" or goblin land\nof that country; indeed, hesitated a little at Pueblo, the turning\npoint--wanted to thread the Veta pass--wanted to go over the Santa\nFe trail away southwestward to New Mexico--but turn'd and set my face\neastward--leaving behind me whetting glimpse-tastes of southeastern\nColorado, Pueblo, Bald mountain, the Spanish peaks, Sangre de Christos,\nMile-Shoe-curve (which my veteran friend on the locomotive told me was\n\"the boss railroad curve of the universe,\") fort Garland on the plains,\nVeta, and the three great peaks of the Sierra Blancas. The Arkansas\nriver plays quite a part in the whole of this region--I see it, or\nits high-cut rocky northern shore, for miles, and cross and recross it\nfrequently, as it winds and squirms like a snake. The plains vary here\neven more than usual--sometimes a long sterile stretch of scores of\nmiles--then green, fertile and grassy, an equal length. Some very large\nherds of sheep. (One wants new words in writing about these plains, and\nall the inland American West--the terms, _far, large, vast_, &c., are\ninsufficient.)\n\n\nA SILENT LITTLE FOLLOWER-THE COREOPSIS\n\nHere I must say a word about a little follower, present even now before\nmy eyes. I have been accompanied on my whole journey from Barnegat to\nPike's peak by a pleasant floricultural friend, or rather millions of\nfriends--nothing more or less than a hardy little yellow five-petal'd\nSeptember and October wild-flower, growing I think everywhere in the\nmiddle and northern United States. I had seen it on the Hudson and over\nLong Island, and along the banks of the Delaware and through New Jersey,\n(as years ago up the Connecticut, and one fall by Lake Champlain.) This\ntrip it follow'd me regularly, with its slender stem and eyes of gold,\nfrom Cape May to the Kaw valley, and so through the canons and to these\nplains. In Missouri I saw immense fields all bright with it. Toward\nwestern Illinois I woke up one morning in the sleeper and the first\nthing when I drew the curtain of my berth and look'd out was its pretty\ncountenance and bending neck.\n\n_Sept. 25th_.--Early morning--still going east after we leave Sterling,\nKansas, where I stopp'd a day and night. The sun up about half an hour;\nnothing can be fresher or more beautiful than this time, this region. I\nsee quite a field of my yellow flower in full bloom. At intervals dots\nof nice two-story houses, as we ride swiftly by. Over the immense area,\nflat as a floor, visible for twenty miles in every direction in the\nclear air, a prevalence of autumn-drab and reddish-tawny herbage--sparse\nstacks of hay and enclosures, breaking the landscape--as we rumble by,\nflocks of prairie-hens starting up. Between Sterling and Florence a\nfine country. (Remembrances to E. L., my old-young soldier friend of war\ntimes, and his wife and boy at S.)\n\n\nTHE PRAIRIES AND GREAT PLAINS IN POETRY\n\n(_After traveling Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado_) Grand as\nis the thought that doubtless the child is already born who will see\na hundred millions of people, the most prosperous and advanc'd of the\nworld, inhabiting these Prairies, the great Plains, and the valley of\nthe Mississippi, I could not help thinking it would be grander still\nto see all those inimitable American areas fused in the alembic of\na perfect poem, or other esthetic work, entirely western, fresh and\nlimitless--altogether our own, without a trace or taste of Europe's\nsoil, reminiscence, technical letter or spirit. My days and nights, as I\ntravel here--what an exhilaration!--not the air alone, and the sense\nof vastness, but every local sight and feature. Everywhere something\ncharacteristic--the cactuses, pinks, buffalo grass, wild sage--the\nreceding perspective, and the far circle-line of the horizon all times\nof day, especially forenoon--the clear, pure, cool, rarefied nutriment\nfor the lungs, previously quite unknown--the black patches and streaks\nleft by surface-conflagrations--the deep-plough'd furrow of the\n\"fire-guard\"--the slanting snow-racks built all along to shield\nthe railroad from winter drifts--the prairie-dogs and the herds\nof antelope--the curious \"dry rivers\"--occasionally a \"dug-out\" or\ncorral--Fort Riley and Fort Wallace--those towns of the northern plains,\n(like ships on the sea,) Eagle-Tail, Coyote, Cheyenne, Agate, Monotony,\nKit Carson--with ever the ant-hill and the buffalo-wallow--ever the\nherds of cattle and the cow-boys (\"cow-punchers\") to me a strangely\ninteresting class, bright-eyed as hawks, with their swarthy complexions\nand their broad-brimm'd hats--apparently always on horseback, with loose\narms slightly raised and swinging as they ride.\n\n\nTHE SPANISH PEAKS--EVENING ON THE PLAINS\n\nBetween Pueblo and Bent's fort, southward, in a clear afternoon\nsun-spell I catch exceptionally good glimpses of the Spanish peaks.\nWe are in southeastern Colorado--pass immense herds of cattle as our\nfirst-class locomotive rushes us along--two or three times crossing\nthe Arkansas, which we follow many miles, and of which river I get fine\nviews, sometimes for quite a distance, its stony, upright, not very\nhigh, palisade banks, and then its muddy flats. We pass Fort Lyon--lots\nof adobie houses--limitless pasturage, appropriately fleck'd with those\nherds of cattle--in due time the declining sun in the west--a sky of\nlimpid pearl over all--and so evening on the great plains. A calm,\npensive, boundless landscape--the perpendicular rocks of the north\nArkansas, hued in twilight--a thin line of violet on the southwestern\nhorizon--the palpable coolness and slight aroma--a belated cow-boy with\nsome unruly member of his herd--an emigrant wagon toiling yet a little\nfurther, the horses slow and tired--two men, apparently father and son,\njogging along on foot--and around all the indescribable _chiaroscuro_\nand sentiment, (profounder than anything at sea,) athwart these endless\nwilds.\n\n\nAMERICA'S CHARACTERISTIC LANDSCAPE\n\nSpeaking generally as to the capacity and sure future destiny of that\nplain and prairie area (larger than any European kingdom) it is the\ninexhaustible land of wheat, maize, wool, flax, coal, iron, beef and\npork, butter and cheese, apples and grapes--land of ten million virgin\nfarms--to the eye at present wild and unproductive--yet experts say\nthat upon it when irrigated may easily be grown enough wheat to feed the\nworld. Then as to scenery (giving my own thought and feeling,) while\nI know the standard claim is that Yosemite, Niagara falls, the upper\nYellowstone and the like, afford the greatest natural shows, I am not\nso sure but the Prairies and the Plains, while less stunning at first\nsight, last longer, fill the esthetic sense fuller, precede all the\nrest, and make North America's characteristic landscape.\n\nIndeed through the whole of this journey, with all its shows and\nvarieties, what most impress'd me, and will longest remain with me, are\nthese same prairies. Day after day, and night after night, to my eyes,\nto all my senses--the esthetic one most of all--they silently and\nbroadly unfolded. Even their simplest statistics are sublime.\n\n\nEARTH'S MOST IMPORTANT STREAM\n\nThe valley of the Mississippi river and its tributaries, (this stream\nand its adjuncts involve a big part of the question,) comprehends more\nthan twelve hundred thousand square miles, the greater part prairies. It\nis by far the most important stream on the globe, and would seem to have\nbeen marked out by design, slow-flowing from north to south, through\na dozen climates, all fitted for man's healthy occupancy, its outlet\nunfrozen all the year, and its line forming a safe, cheap continental\navenue for commerce and passage from the north temperate to the torrid\nzone. Not even the mighty Amazon (though larger in volume) on its line\nof east and west--not the Nile in Africa, nor the Danube in Europe, nor\nthe three great rivers of China, compare with it. Only the Mediterranean\nsea has play'd some such part in history, and all through the past,\nas the Mississippi is destined to play in the future. By its demesnes,\nwater'd and welded by its branches, the Missouri, the Ohio, the\nArkansas, the Red, the Yazoo, the St. Francis and others, it already\ncompacts twenty-five millions of people, not merely the most peaceful\nand money-making, but the most restless and warlike on earth. Its\nvalley, or reach, is rapidly concentrating the political power of the\nAmerican Union. One almost thinks it _is_ the Union--or soon will be.\nTake it out, with its radiations, and what would be left? From the car\nwindows through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, or stopping some days along\nthe Topeka and Santa Fe road, in southern Kansas, and indeed wherever\nI went, hundreds and thousands of miles through this region, my eyes\nfeasted on primitive and rich meadows, some of them partially inhabited,\nbut far, immensely far more untouch'd, unbroken--and much of it more\nlovely and fertile in its unplough'd innocence than the fair and\nvaluable fields of New York's, Pennsylvania's, Maryland's or Virginia's\nrichest farms.\n\n\nPRAIRIE ANALOGIES--THE TREE QUESTION\n\nThe word Prairie is French, and means literally meadow. The cosmical\nanalogies of our North American plains are the Steppes of Asia, the\nPampas and Llanos of South America, and perhaps the Saharas of Africa.\nSome think the plains have been originally lake-beds; others attribute\nthe absence of forests to the fires that almost annually sweep over\nthem--(the cause, in vulgar estimation, of Indian summer.) The tree\nquestion will soon become a grave one. Although the Atlantic slope,\nthe Rocky mountain region, and the southern portion of the Mississippi\nvalley, are well wooded, there are here stretches of hundreds and\nthousands of miles where either not a tree grows, or often useless\ndestruction has prevail'd; and the matter of the cultivation and spread\nof forests may well be press'd upon thinkers who look to the coming\ngenerations of the prairie States.\n\n\nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY LITERATURE\n\nLying by one rainy day in Missouri to rest after quite a long\nexploration--first trying a big volume I found there of \"Milton, Young,\nGray, Beattie and Collins,\" but giving it up for a bad job--enjoying\nhowever for awhile, as often before, the reading of Walter Scott's\npoems, \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" \"Marmion,\" and so on--I stopp'd and\nlaid down the book, and ponder'd the thought of a poetry that should in\ndue time express and supply the teeming region I was in the midst\nof, and have briefly touch'd upon. One's mind needs but a moment's\ndeliberation anywhere in the United States to see clearly enough that\nall the prevalent book and library poets, either as imported from\nGreat Britain, or follow'd and _doppel-gang'd_ here, are foreign to our\nStates, copiously as they are read by us all. But to fully understand\nnot only how absolutely in opposition to our times and lands, and how\nlittle and cramp'd, and what anachronisms and absurdities many of their\npages are, for American purposes, one must dwell or travel awhile in\nMissouri, Kansas and Colorado, and get rapport with their people and\ncountry.\n\nWill the day ever come--no matter how long deferr'd--when those\nmodels and lay-figures from the British islands--and even the precious\ntraditions of the classics--will be reminiscences, studies only? The\npure breath, primitiveness, boundless prodigality and amplitude, strange\nmixture of delicacy and power, of continence, of real and ideal, and\nof all original and first-class elements, of these prairies, the Rocky\nmountains, and of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers--will they ever\nappear in, and in some sort form a standard for our poetry and art? (I\nsometimes think that even the ambition of my friend Joaquin Miller to\nput them in, and illustrate them, places him ahead of the whole crowd.)\n\nNot long ago I was down New York bay, on a steamer, watching the sunset\nover the dark green heights of Navesink, and viewing all that inimitable\nspread of shore, shipping and sea, around Sandy Hook. But an intervening\nweek or two, and my eyes catch the shadowy outlines of the Spanish\npeaks. In the more than two thousand miles between, though of infinite\nand paradoxical variety, a curious and absolute fusion is doubtless\nsteadily annealing, compacting, identifying all. But subtler and wider\nand more solid, (to produce such compaction,) than the laws of the\nStates, or the common ground of Congress, or the Supreme Court, or the\ngrim welding of our national wars, or the steel ties of railroads,\nor all the kneading and fusing processes of our material and business\nhistory, past or present, would in my opinion be a great throbbing,\nvital, imaginative work, or series of works, or literature, in\nconstructing which the Plains, the Prairies, and the Mississippi river,\nwith the demesnes of its varied and ample valley, should be the concrete\nbackground, and America's humanity, passions, struggles, hopes, there\nand now--an _eclaircissement_ as it is and is to be, on the stage of\nthe New World, of all Time's hitherto drama of war, romance and\nevolution--should furnish the lambent fire, the ideal.\n\n\nAN INTERVIEWER'S ITEM\n\n_Oct. 17, '79_.--To-day one of the newspapers of St. Louis prints the\nfollowing informal remarks of mine on American, especially Western\nliterature: \"We called on Mr. Whitman yesterday and after a somewhat\ndesultory conversation abruptly asked him: 'Do you think we are to have\na distinctively American literature?' 'It seems to me,' said he,'that\nour work at present is to lay the foundations of a great nation\nin products, in agriculture, in commerce, in networks of\nintercommunication, and in all that relates to the comforts of vast\nmasses of men and families, with freedom of speech, ecclesiasticism, &c.\nThese we have founded and are carrying out on a grander scale than ever\nhitherto, and Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado,\nseem to me to be the seat and field of these very facts and ideas.\nMaterialistic prosperity in all its varied forms, with those other\npoints that I mentioned, intercommunication and freedom, are first to\nbe attended to. When those have their results and get settled, then\na literature worthy of us will begin to be defined. Our American\nsuperiority and vitality are in the bulk of our people, not in a gentry\nlike the old world. The greatness of our army during the secession war,\nwas in the rank and file, and so with the nation. Other lands have their\nvitality in a few, a class, but we have it in the bulk of the people.\nOur leading men are not of much account and never have been, but the\naverage of the people is immense, beyond all history. Sometimes I think\nin all departments, literature and art included, that will be the way\nour superiority will exhibit itself. We will not have great individuals\nor great leaders, but a great average bulk, unprecedentedly great.'\"\n\n\nTHE WOMEN OF THE WEST\n\n_Kansas City_.--I am not so well satisfied with what I see of the women\nof the prairie cities. I am writing this where I sit leisurely in a\nstore in Main street, Kansas City, a streaming crowd on the sidewalks\nflowing by. The ladies (and the same in Denver) are all fashionably\ndrest, and have the look of \"gentility\" in face, manner and action, but\nthey do _not_ have, either in physique or the mentality appropriate\nto them, any high native originality of spirit or body, (as the men\ncertainly have, appropriate to them.) They are \"intellectual\" and\nfashionable, but dyspeptic-looking and generally doll-like; their\nambition evidently is to copy their eastern sisters. Something far\ndifferent and in advance must appear, to tally and complete the superb\nmasculinity of the west, and maintain and continue it.\n\n\nTHE SILENT GENERAL\n\n_Sept. 28, '79_.--So General Grant, after circumambiating the world,\nhas arrived home again, landed in San Francisco yesterday, from the\nship City of Tokio from Japan. What a man he is! what a history! what an\nillustration--his life--of the capacities of that American individuality\ncommon to us all. Cynical critics are wondering \"what the people can\nsee in Grant\" to make such a hubbub about. They aver (and it is no\ndoubt true) that he has hardly the average of our day's literary and\nscholastic culture, and absolutely no pronounc'd genius or conventional\neminence of any sort. Correct: but he proves how an average western\nfarmer, mechanic, boatman, carried by tides of circumstances,\nperhaps caprices, into a position of incredible military or civic\nresponsibilities, (history has presented none more trying, no born\nmonarch's, no mark more shining for attack or envy,) may steer his way\nfitly and steadily through them all, carrying the country and himself\nwith credit year after year--command over a million armed men--fight\nmore than fifty pitch'd battles--rule for eight years a land larger than\nall the kingdoms of Europe combined--and then, retiring, quietly (with\na cigar in his mouth) make the promenade of the whole world, through its\ncourts and coteries, and kings and czars and mikados, and splendidest\nglitters and etiquettes, as phlegmatically as he ever walk'd the\nportico of a Missouri hotel after dinner. I say all this is what people\nlike--and I am sure I like it. Seems to me it transcends Plutarch. How\nthose old Greeks, indeed, would have seized on him! A mere plain man--no\nart, no poetry--only practical sense, ability to do, or try his best to\ndo, what devolv'd upon him. A common trader, money-maker, tanner, farmer\nof Illinois--general for the republic, in its terrific struggle with\nitself, in the war of attempted secession--President following, (a task\nof peace, more difficult than the war itself)--nothing heroic, as the\nauthorities put it--and yet the greatest hero. The gods, the destinies,\nseem to have concentrated upon him.\n\n\nPRESIDENT HAYES'S SPEECHES\n\n_Sept. 30_.--I see President Hayes has come out West, passing quite\ninformally from point to point, with his wife and a small cortege of\nbig officers, receiving ovations, and making daily and sometimes\ndouble-daily addresses to the people. To these addresses--all impromptu,\nand some would call them ephemeral--I feel to devote a memorandum. They\nare shrewd, good-natur'd, face-to-face speeches, on easy topics not\ntoo deep; but they give me some revised ideas of oratory--of a new,\nopportune theory and practice of that art, quite changed from the\nclassic rules, and adapted to our days, our occasions, to American\ndemocracy, and to the swarming populations of the West. I hear them\ncriticised as wanting in dignity, but to me they are just what they\nshould be, considering all the circumstances, who they come from, and\nwho they are address'd to. Underneath, his objects are to compact and\nfraternize the States, encourage their materialistic and industrial\ndevelopment, soothe and expand their self-poise, and tie all and each\nwith resistless double ties not only of inter-trade barter, but human\ncomradeship.\n\nFrom Kansas City I went on to St. Louis, where I remain'd nearly three\nmonths, with my brother T.J.W., and my dear nieces.\n\n\nST. LOUIS MEMORANDA\n\n_Oct., Nov., and Dec., '79_.--The points of St. Louis are its position,\nits absolute wealth, (the long accumulations of time and trade, solid\nriches, probably a higher average thereof than any city,) the unrivall'd\namplitude of its well-laid-out environage of broad plateaus, for\nfuture expansion--and the great State of which it is the head. It fuses\nnorthern and southern qualities, perhaps native and foreign ones, to\nperfection, rendezvous the whole stretch of the Mississippi and Missouri\nrivers, and its American electricity goes well with its German phlegm.\nFourth, Fifth and Third streets are store-streets, showy, modern,\nmetropolitan, with hurrying crowds, vehicles, horse-cars, hubbub, plenty\nof people, rich goods, plate-glass windows, iron fronts often five or\nsix stories high. You can purchase anything in St. Louis (in most of the\nbig western cities for the matter of that) just as readily and cheaply\nas in the Atlantic marts. Often in going about the town you see\nreminders of old, even decay'd civilization. The water of the west, in\nsome places, is not good, but they make it up here by plenty of very\nfair wine, and inexhaustible quantities of the best beer in the world.\nThere are immense establishments for slaughtering beef and pork--and I\nsaw flocks of sheep, 5000 in a flock. (In Kansas City I had visited a\npacking establishment that kills and packs an average of 2500 hogs a\nday the whole year round, for export. Another in Atchison, Kansas, same\nextent; others nearly equal elsewhere. And just as big ones here.)\n\n\nNIGHTS ON THE MISSISSIPPI\n\n_Oct. 29th, 30th, and 31st_.--Wonderfully fine, with the full harvest\nmoon, dazzling and silvery. I have haunted the river every night lately,\nwhere I could get a look at the bridge by moonlight. It is indeed a\nstructure of perfection and beauty unsurpassable, and I never tire of\nit. The river at present is very low; I noticed to-day it had much more\nof a blue-clear look than usual. I hear the slight ripples, the air\nis fresh and cool, and the view, up or down, wonderfully clear, in the\nmoonlight. I am out pretty late: it is so fascinating, dreamy. The cool\nnight-air, all the influences, the silence, with those far-off eternal\nstars, do me good. I have been quite ill of late. And so, well-near the\ncentre of our national demesne, these night views of the Mississippi.\n\n\nUPON OUR OWN LAND\n\n\"Always, after supper, take a walk half a mile long,\" says an old\nproverb, dryly adding, \"and if convenient let it be upon your own land.\"\nI wonder does any other nation but ours afford opportunity for such a\njaunt as this? Indeed has any previous period afforded it? No one, I\ndiscover, begins to know the real geographic, democratic, indissoluble\nAmerican Union in the present, or suspect it in the future, until he\nexplores these Central States, and dwells awhile observantly on their\nprairies, or amid their busy towns, and the mighty father of waters. A\nride of two or three thousand miles, \"on one's own land,\" with hardly a\ndisconnection, could certainly be had in no other place than the United\nStates, and at no period before this. If you want to see what the\nrailroad is, and how civilization and progress date from it--how it\nis the conqueror of crude nature, which it turns to man's use, both on\nsmall scales and on the largest--come hither to inland America.\n\nI return'd home, east, Jan. 5, 1880, having travers'd, to and fro and\nacross, 10,000 miles and more. I soon resumed my seclusions down in\nthe woods, or by the creek, or gaddings about cities, and an occasional\ndisquisition, as will be seen following.\n\n\nEDGAR POE'S SIGNIFICANCE\n\n_Jan. 1, '80_.--In diagnosing this disease called humanity--to assume\nfor the nonce what seems a chief mood of the personality and writings of\nmy subject--I have thought that poets, somewhere or other on the list,\npresent the most mark'd indications. Comprehending artists in a mass,\nmusicians, painters, actors, and so on, and considering each and all of\nthem as radiations or flanges of that furious whirling wheel, poetry,\nthe centre and axis of the whole, where else indeed may we so well\ninvestigate the causes, growths, tally-marks of the time--the age's\nmatter and malady?\n\nBy common consent there is nothing better for man or woman than a\nperfect and noble life, morally without flaw, happily balanced in\nactivity, physically sound and pure, giving its due proportion, and no\nmore, to the sympathetic, the human emotional element--a life, in all\nthese, unhasting, unresting, untiring to the end. And yet there is\nanother shape of personality dearer far to the artist-sense, (which\nlikes the play of strongest lights and shades,) where the perfect\ncharacter, the good, the heroic, although never attain'd, is never\nlost sight of, but through failures, sorrows, temporary downfalls, is\nreturn'd to again and again, and while often violated, is passionately\nadhered to as long as mind, muscles, voice, obey the power we call\nvolition. This sort of personality we see more or less in Burns, Byron,\nSchiller, and George Sand. But we do not see it in Edgar Poe. (All this\nis the result of reading at intervals the last three days a new volume\nof his poems--I took it on my rambles down by the pond, and by degrees\nread it all through there.) While to the character first outlined the\nservice Poe renders is certainly that entire contrast and contradiction\nwhich is next best to fully exemplifying it.\n\nAlmost without the first sign of moral principle, or of the concrete\nor its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses\nillustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty, with\nthe rhyming art to excess, an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal\nthemes, a demoniac undertone behind every page--and, by final judgment,\nprobably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature,\nbrilliant and dazzling, but with no heat. There is an indescribable\nmagnetism about the poet's life and reminiscences, as well as the poems.\nTo one who could work out their subtle retracing and retrospect, the\nlatter would make a close tally no doubt between the author's birth\nand antecedents, his childhood and youth, his physique, his so-call'd\neducation, his studies and associates, the literary and social\nBaltimore, Richmond, Philadelphia and New York, of those times--not only\nthe places and circumstances in themselves, but often, very often, in a\nstrange spurning of, and reaction from them all.\n\nThe following from a report in the Washington \"Star\" of November 16,\n1875, may afford those who care for it something further of my point\nof view toward this interesting figure and influence of our era.\nThere occurr'd about that date in Baltimore a public reburial of Poe's\nremains, and dedication of a monument over the grave:\n\n\"Being in Washington on a visit at the time, 'the old gray' went over\nto Baltimore, and though ill from paralysis, consented to hobble up and\nsilently take a seat on the platform, but refused to make any speech,\nsaying, 'I have felt a strong impulse to come over and be here to-day\nmyself in memory of Poe, which I have obey'd, but not the slightest\nimpulse to make a speech, which, my dear friends, must also be obeyed.'\nIn an informal circle, however, in conversation after the ceremonies,\nWhitman said: 'For a long while, and until lately, I had a distaste\nfor Poe's writings. I wanted, and still want for poetry, the clear sun\nshining, and fresh air blowing--the strength and power of health, not of\ndelirium, even amid the stormiest passions--with always the background\nof the eternal moralities. Non-complying with these requirements, Poe's\ngenius has yet conquer'd a special recognition for itself, and I too\nhave come to fully admit it, and appreciate it and him.\n\n\"'In a dream I once had, I saw a vessel on the sea, at midnight, in a\nstorm. It was no great full-rigg'd ship, nor majestic steamer, steering\nfirmly through the gale, but seem'd one of those superb little schooner\nyachts I had often seen lying anchor'd, rocking so jauntily, in the\nwaters around New York, or up Long Island sound--now flying uncontroll'd\nwith torn sails and broken spars through the wild sleet and winds and\nwaves of the night. On the deck was a slender, slight, beautiful\nfigure, a dim man, apparently enjoying all the terror, the murk, and the\ndislocation of which he was the centre and the victim. That figure of my\nlurid dream might stand for Edgar Poe, his spirit, his fortunes, and his\npoems--themselves all lurid dreams.'\"\n\nMuch more may be said, but I most desired to exploit the idea put at the\nbeginning. By its popular poets the calibres of an age, the weak spots\nof its embankments, its sub-currents, (often more significant than the\nbiggest surface ones,) are unerringly indicated. The lush and the weird\nthat have taken such extraordinary possession of Nineteenth century\nverse-lovers--what mean they? The inevitable tendency of poetic culture\nto morbidity, abnormal beauty--the sickliness of all technical thought\nor refinement in itself--the abnegation of the perennial and democratic\nconcretes at first hand, the body, the earth and sea, sex and the\nlike--and the substitution of something for them at second or third\nhand--what bearings have they on current pathological study?\n\n\nBEETHOVEN'S SEPTETTE\n\n_Feb. 11, '80_.--At a good concert to-night in the foyer of the opera\nhouse, Philadelphia--the band a small but first-rate one. Never\ndid music more sink into and soothe and fill me--never so prove its\nsoul-rousing power, its impossibility of statement. Especially in the\nrendering of one of Beethoven's master septettes by the well-chosen and\nperfectly-combined instruments (violins, viola, clarionet, horn, 'cello\nand contrabass,) was I carried away, seeing, absorbing many wonders.\nDainty abandon, sometimes as if Nature laughing on a hillside in the\nsunshine; serious and firm monotonies, as of winds; a horn sounding\nthrough the tangle of the forest, and the dying echoes; soothing\nfloating of waves, but presently rising in surges, angrily lashing,\nmuttering, heavy; piercing peals of laughter, for interstices; now\nand then weird, as Nature herself is in certain moods--but mainly\nspontaneous, easy, careless--often the sentiment of the postures of\nnaked children playing or sleeping. It did me good even to watch the\nviolinists drawing their bows so masterly--every motion a study. I\nallow'd myself, as I sometimes do, to wander out of myself. The conceit\ncame to me of a copious grove of singing birds, and in their midst\na simple harmonic duo, two human souls, steadily asserting their own\npensiveness, joyousness.\n\n\nA HINT OF WILD NATURE\n\n_Feb. 13_.--As I was crossing the Delaware to-day, saw a large flock\nof wild geese, right overhead, not very high up, ranged in V-shape,\nin relief against the noon clouds of light smoke-color. Had a capital\nthough momentary view of them, and then of their course on and on\nsoutheast, till gradually fading--(my eyesight yet first rate for\nthe open air and its distances, but I use glasses for reading.) Queer\nthoughts melted into me the two or three minutes, or less, seeing\nthese creatures cleaving the sky--the spacious, airy realm--even the\nprevailing smoke-gray color everywhere, (no sun shining)--the\nwaters below--the rapid flight of the birds, appearing just for a\nminute--flashing to me such a hint of the whole spread of Nature, with\nher eternal unsophisticated freshness, her never-visited recesses of\nsea, sky, shore--and then disappearing in the distance.\n\n\nLOAFING IN THE WOODS\n\n_March 8_.--I write this down in the country again, but in a new spot,\nseated on a log in the woods, warm, sunny, midday. Have been loafing\nhere deep among the trees, shafts of tall pines, oak, hickory, with\na thick undergrowth of laurels and grapevines--the ground cover'd\neverywhere by debris, dead leaves, breakage, moss--everything solitary,\nancient, grim. Paths (such as they are) leading hither and yon--(how\nmade I know not, for nobody seems to come here, nor man nor\ncattle-kind.) Temperature to-day about 60, the wind through the\npine-tops; I sit and listen to its hoarse sighing above (and to the\n_stillness_) long and long, varied by aimless rambles in the old roads\nand paths, and by exercise-pulls at the young saplings, to keep my\njoints from getting stiff. Blue-birds, robins, meadow-larks begin to\nappear.\n\n_Next day, 9th_.--A snowstorm in the morning, and continuing most of the\nday. But I took a walk over two hours, the same woods and paths, amid\nthe falling flakes. No wind, yet the musical low murmur through the\npines, quite pronounced, curious, like waterfalls, now still'd,\nnow pouring again. All the senses, sight, sound, smell, delicately\ngratified. Every snowflake lay where it fell on the evergreens,\nholly-trees, laurels, &c., the multitudinous leaves and branches piled,\nbulging-white, defined by edge-lines of emerald--the tall straight\ncolumns of the plentiful bronze-topt pines--a slight resinous odor\nblending with that of the snow. (For there is a scent to everything,\neven the snow, if you can only detect it--no two places, hardly any\ntwo hours, anywhere, exactly alike. How different the odor of noon from\nmidnight, or winter from summer, or a windy spell from a still one.)\n\n\nA CONTRALTO VOICE\n\n_May 9, Sunday_.--Visit this evening to my friends the J.'s--good\nsupper, to which I did justice--lively chat with Mrs. J. and I. and\nJ. As I sat out front on the walk afterward, in the evening air, the\nchurch-choir and organ on the corner opposite gave Luther's hymn, _Ein\nfeste berg_, very finely. The air was borne by a rich contralto. For\nnearly half an hour there in the dark (there was a good string of\nEnglish stanzas,) came the music, firm and unhurried, with long pauses.\nThe full silver star-beams of Lyra rose silently over the church's dim\nroof-ridge. Vari-color'd lights from the stain'd glass windows broke\nthrough the tree-shadows. And under all--under the Northern Crown up\nthere, and in the fresh breeze below, and the _chiaroscuro_ of the\nnight, that liquid-full contralto.\n\n\nSEEING NIAGARA TO ADVANTAGE\n\n_June 4, '80_.--For really seizing a great picture or book, or piece of\nmusic, or architecture, or grand scenery--or perhaps for the first time\neven the common sunshine, or landscape, or may-be even the mystery\nof identity, most curious mystery of all--there comes some lucky\nfive minutes of a man's life, set amid a fortuitous concurrence of\ncircumstances, and bringing in a brief flash the culmination of years of\nreading and travel and thought. The present case about two o'clock this\nafternoon, gave me Niagara, its superb severity of action and color and\nmajestic grouping, in one short, indescribable show. We were very slowly\ncrossing the Suspension bridge-not a full stop anywhere, but next to\nit--the day clear, sunny, still--and I out on the platform. The\nfalls were in plain view about a mile off, but very distinct, and no\nroar--hardly a murmur. The river tumbling green and white, far below\nme; the dark high banks, the plentiful umbrage, many bronze cedars, in\nshadow; and tempering and arching all the immense materiality, a clear\nsky overhead, with a few white clouds, limpid, spiritual, silent. Brief,\nand as quiet as brief, that picture--a remembrance always afterwards.\nSuch are the things, indeed, I lay away with my life's rare and blessed\nbits of hours, reminiscent, past--the wild sea-storm I once saw one\nwinter day, off Fire island--the elder Booth in Richard, that famous\nnight forty years ago in the old Bowery--or Alboni in the children's\nscene in Norma--or night-views, I remember, on the field, after battles\nin Virginia--or the peculiar sentiment of moonlight and stars over the\ngreat Plains, western Kansas--or scooting up New York bay, with a stiff\nbreeze and a good yacht, off Navesink. With these, I say, I henceforth\nplace that view, that afternoon, that combination complete, that five\nminutes' perfect absorption of Niagara--not the great majestic gem\nalone by itself, but set complete in all its varied, full, indispensable\nsurroundings.\n\n\nJAUNTING TO CANADA\n\nTo go back a little, I left Philadelphia, 9th and Green streets, at 8\no'clock P.M., June 3, on a first-class sleeper, by the Lehigh Valley\n(North Pennsylvania) route, through Bethlehem, Wilkesbarre, Waverly, and\nso (by Erie) on through Corning to Hornellsville, where we arrived at 8,\nmorning, and had a bounteous breakfast. I must say I never put in such a\ngood night on any railroad track--smooth, firm, the minimum of jolting,\nand all the swiftness compatible with safety. So without change to\nBuffalo, and thence to Clifton, where we arrived early afternoon; then\non to London, Ontario, Canada, in four more--less than twenty-two hours\naltogether. I am domiciled at the hospitable house of my friends Dr. and\nMrs. Bucke, in the ample and charming garden and lawns of the asylum.\n\n\nSUNDAY WITH THE INSANE\n\n_June 6_.--Went over to the religious services (Episcopal) main Insane\nasylum, held in a lofty, good-sized hall, third story. Plain boards,\nwhitewash, plenty of cheap chairs, no ornament or color, yet all\nscrupulously clean and sweet. Some three hundred persons present, mostly\npatients. Everything, the prayers, a short sermon, the firm, orotund\nvoice of the minister, and most of all, beyond any portraying, or\nsuggesting, _that audience_, deeply impress'd me. I was furnish'd with\nan arm-chair near the pulpit, and sat facing the motley, yet perfectly\nwell-behaved and orderly congregation. The quaint dresses and bonnets\nof some of the women, several very old and gray, here and there like\nthe heads in old pictures. O the looks that came from those faces! There\nwere two or three I shall probably never forget. Nothing at all markedly\nrepulsive or hideous--strange enough I did not see one such. Our common\nhumanity, mine and yours, everywhere:\n\n    \"The same old blood--the same red, running blood;\"\n\nyet behind most, an inferr'd arriere of such storms, such wrecks, such\nmysteries, fires, love, wrong, greed for wealth, religious problems,\ncrosses--mirror'd from those crazed faces (yet now temporarily so\ncalm, like still waters,) all the woes and sad happenings of life and\ndeath--now from every one the devotional element radiating--was it not,\nindeed, _the peace of God that passeth all understanding_, strange as it\nmay sound? I can only say that I took long and searching eyesweeps as\nI sat there, and it seem'd so, rousing unprecedented thoughts, problems\nunanswerable. A very fair choir, and melodeon accompaniment. They sang\n\"Lead, kindly light,\" after the sermon. Many join'd in the beautiful\nhymn, to which the minister read the introductory text, _In the daytime\nalso He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire_.\nThen the words:\n\n    Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,\n             Lead thou me on.\n    The night is dark, and I am far from home;\n             Lead thou me on.\n    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see\n    The distant scene; one step enough for me.\n\n    I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that thou\n             Should'st lead me on;\n    I lov'd to choose and see my path; but now\n             Lead thou me on.\n    I loved the garish day, and spite of fears\n    Pride ruled my will; remember not past years.\n\nA couple of days after, I went to the \"Refractory building,\" under\nspecial charge of Dr. Beemer, and through the wards pretty thoroughly,\nboth the men's and women's. I have since made many other visits of the\nkind through the asylum, and around among the detach'd cottages. As far\nas I could see, this is among the most advanced, perfected, and kindly\nand rationally carried on, of all its kind in America. It is a town in\nitself, with many buildings and a thousand inhabitants.\n\nI learn that Canada, and especially this ample and populous province,\nOntario, has the very best and plentiest benevolent institutions in all\ndepartments.\n\n\nREMINISCENCE OF ELIAS HICKS\n\n_June 8_.--To-day a letter from Mrs. E. S. L., Detroit, accompanied in\na little post-office roll by a rare old engraved head of Elias Hicks,\n(from a portrait in oil by Henry Inman, painted for J. V. S., must have\nbeen 60 years or more ago, in New York)--among the rest the following\nexcerpt about E. H. in the letter:\n\n  \"I have listen'd to his preaching so often when a child, and sat with\n  my mother at social gatherings where he was the centre, and every one\n  so pleas'd and stirr'd by his conversation. I hear that you contemplate\n  writing or speaking about him, and I wonder'd whether you had a picture\n  of him. As I am the owner of two, I send you one.\"\n\n\nGRAND NATIVE GROWTH\n\nIn a few days I go to lake Huron, and may have something to say of\nthat region and people. From what I already see, I should say the young\nnative population of Canada was growing up, forming a hardy, democratic,\nintelligent, radically sound, and just as American, good-natured and\n_individualistic_ race, as the average range of best specimens among\nus. As among us, too, I please myself by considering that this element,\nthough it may not be the majority, promises to be the leaven which must\neventually leaven the whole lump.\n\n\nA ZOLLVEREIN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA\n\nSome of the more liberal of the presses here are discussing the question\nof a zollverein between the United States and Canada. It is proposed to\nform a union for commercial purposes--to altogether abolish the frontier\ntariff line, with its double sets of custom house officials now existing\nbetween the two countries, and to agree upon one tariff for both, the\nproceeds of this tariff to be divided between the two governments on the\nbasis of population. It is said that a large proportion of the merchants\nof Canada are in favor of this step, as they believe it would materially\nadd to the business of the country, by removing the restrictions that\nnow exist on trade between Canada and the States. Those persons who\nare opposed to the measure believe that it would increase the material\nwelfare or the country, but it would loosen the bonds between Canada\nand England; and this sentiment overrides the desire for commercial\nprosperity. Whether the sentiment can continue to bear the strain\nput upon it is a question. It is thought by many that commercial\nconsiderations must in the end prevail. It seems also to be generally\nagreed that such a zollverein, or common customs union, would bring\npractically more benefits to the Canadian provinces than to the United\nStates. (It seems to me a certainty of time, sooner or later, that\nCanada shall form two or three grand States, equal and independent, with\nthe rest of the American Union. The St. Lawrence and lakes are not for a\nfrontier line, but a grand interior or mid-channel.)\n\n\nTHE ST. LAWRENCE LINE\n\n_August 20_.--Premising that my three or four months in Canada were\nintended, among the rest, as an exploration of the line of the St.\nLawrence, from lake Superior to the sea, (the engineers here insist upon\nconsidering it as one stream, over 2000 miles long, including lakes and\nNiagara and all)--that I have only partially carried out my programme;\nbut for the seven or eight hundred miles so far fulfill'd, I find that\nthe _Canada question_ is absolutely control'd by this vast water line,\nwith its first-class features and points of trade, humanity, and\nmany more--here I am writing this nearly a thousand miles north of my\nPhiladelphia starting-point (by way of Montreal and Quebec) in the midst\nof regions that go to a further extreme of grimness, wildness of\nbeauty, and a sort of still and pagan _scaredness_, while yet Christian,\ninhabitable, and partially fertile, than perhaps any other on earth. The\nweather remains perfect; some might call it a little cool, but I wear my\nold gray overcoat and find it just right. The days are full of sunbeams\nand oxygen. Most of the forenoons and afternoons I am on the forward\ndeck of the steamer.\n\n\nTHE SAVAGE SAGUENAY\n\nUp these black waters, over a hundred miles--always strong, deep,\n(hundreds of feet, sometimes thousands,) ever with high, rocky hills for\nbanks, green and gray--at times a little like some parts of the Hudson,\nbut much more pronounc'd and defiant. The hills rise higher--keep their\nranks more unbroken. The river is straighter and of more resolute flow,\nand its hue, though dark as ink, exquisitely polish'd and sheeny\nunder the August sun. Different, indeed, this Saguenay from all other\nrivers--different effects--a bolder, more vehement play of lights\nand shades. Of a rare charm of singleness and simplicity. (Like the\norgan-chant at midnight from the old Spanish convent, in \"Favorita\"--one\nstrain only, simple and monotonous and unornamented--but indescribably\npenetrating and grand and masterful.) Great place for echoes: while\nour steamer was tied at the wharf at Tadousac (taj-oo-sac) waiting, the\nescape-pipe letting off steam, I was sure I heard a band at the hotel up\nin the rocks--could even make out some of the tunes. Only when our pipe\nstopp'd, I knew what caused it. Then at cape Eternity and Trinity rock,\nthe pilot with his whistle producing similar marvellous results, echoes\nindescribably weird, as we lay off in the still bay under their shadows.\n\n\nCAPES ETERNITY AND TRINITY\n\nBut the great, haughty, silent capes themselves; I doubt if any crack\npoints, or hills, or historic places of note, or anything of the kind\nelsewhere in the world, outvies these objects--(I write while I am\nbefore them face to face.) They are very simple, they do not startle--at\nleast they did not me--but they linger in one's memory forever. They are\nplaced very near each other, side by side, each a mountain rising flush\nout of the Saguenay. A good thrower could throw a stone on each in\npassing--at least it seems so. Then they are as distinct in form as a\nperfect physical man or a perfect physical woman. Cape Eternity is bare,\nrising, as just said, sheer out of the water, rugged and grim (yet with\nan indescribable beauty) nearly two thousand feet high. Trinity rock,\neven a little higher, also rising flush, top-rounded like a great head\nwith close-cut verdure of hair. I consider myself well repaid for coming\nmy thousand miles to get the sight and memory of the unrivall'd duo.\nThey have stirr'd me more profoundly than anything of the kind I have\nyet seen. If Europe or Asia had them, we should certainly hear of them\nin all sorts of sent-back poems, rhapsodies, &c., a dozen times a year\nthrough our papers and magazines.\n\n\nCHICOUTIMI AND HA-HA BAY\n\nNo indeed--life and travel and memory have offer'd and will preserve to\nme no deeper-cut incidents, panorama, or sights to cheer my soul, than\nthese at Chicoutimi and Ha-ha bay, and my days and nights up and down\nthis fascinating savage river--the rounded mountains, some bare and\ngray, some dull red, some draped close all over with matted green\nverdure or vines--the ample, calm, eternal rocks everywhere--the long\nstreaks of motley foam, a milk-white curd on the glistening breast of\nthe stream--the little two-masted schooner, dingy yellow, with patch'd\nsails, set wing-and-wing, nearing us, coming saucily up the water with a\ncouple of swarthy, black-hair'd men aboard--the strong shades falling on\nthe light gray or yellow outlines of the hills all through the forenoon,\nas we steam within gunshot of them--while ever the pure and delicate\nsky spreads over all. And the splendid sunsets, and the sights of\nevening--the same old stars, (relatively a little different, I see, so\nfar north) Arcturus and Lyra, and the Eagle, and great Jupiter like\na silver globe, and the constellation of the Scorpion. Then northern\nlights nearly every night.\n\n\nTHE INHABITANTS--GOOD LIVING\n\nGrim and rocky and black-water'd as the demesne hereabout is, however,\nyou must not think genial humanity, and comfort, and good-living are not\nto be met. Before I began this memorandum I made a first-rate breakfast\nof sea-trout, finishing off with wild raspberries. I find smiles and\ncourtesy everywhere--physiognomies in general curiously like those in\nthe United States--(I was astonish'd to find the same resemblance all\nthrough the province of Quebec.) In general the inhabitants of this\nrugged country (Charlevoix, Chicoutimi and Tadousac counties, and lake\nSt. John region) a simple, hardy population, lumbering, trapping furs,\nboating, fishing, berry-picking and a little farming. I was watching a\ngroup of young boatmen eating their early dinner--nothing but an immense\nloaf of bread, had apparently been the size of a bushel measure, from\nwhich they cut chunks with a jack-knife. Must be a tremendous winter\ncountry this, when the solid frost and ice fully set in.\n\n\nCEDAR-PLUMS LIKE-NAMES (_Back again in Camden and down in Jersey_)\n\nOne time I thought of naming this collection \"Cedar-Plums Like\" (which I\nstill fancy wouldn't have been a bad name nor inappropriate.) A melange\nof loafing, looking, hobbling, sitting, traveling--a little thinking\nthrown in for salt, but very little--not only summer but all\nseasons--not only days but nights--some literary meditations--books,\nauthors examined, Carlyle, Poe, Emerson tried, (always under my\ncedar-tree, in the open air, and never in the library)--mostly the\nscenes everybody sees, but some of my own caprices, meditations,\negotism--truly an open air and mainly summer formation--singly, or in\nclusters--wild and free and somewhat acrid--indeed more like cedar-plums\nthan you might guess at first glance.\n\nBut do you know what they are? (To city man, or some sweet parlor lady,\nI now talk.) As you go along roads, or barrens, or across country,\nanywhere through these States, middle, eastern, western, or southern,\nyou will see, certain seasons of the year, the thick woolly tufts of\nthe cedar mottled with bunches of china-blue berries, about as big as\nfox-grapes. But first a special word for the tree itself: everybody\nknows that the cedar is a healthy, cheap, democratic wood, streak'd red\nand white--an evergreen--that it is not a _cultivated_ tree--that it\nkeeps away moths--that it grows inland or seaboard, all climates, hot\nor cold, any soil--in fact rather prefers sand and bleak side\nspots--content if the plough, the fertilizer and the trimming-axe, will\nbut keep away and let it alone. After a long rain, when everything looks\nbright, often have I stopt in my wood-saunters, south or north, or far\nwest, to take in its dusky green, wash'd clean and sweet, and speck'd\ncopiously with its fruit of clear, hardy blue. The wood of the cedar\nis of use--but what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums?\nA question impossible to answer satisfactorily. True, some of the herb\ndoctors give them for stomachic affections, but the remedy is as bad as\nthe disease. Then in my rambles down in Camden county I once found an\nold crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy. She show'd,\nas I was told afterward, a sort of infatuation for them, and every year\nplaced and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room. They had a\nstrange charm on her uneasy head, and effected docility and peace. (She\nwas harmless, and lived near by with her well-off married daughter.)\nWhether there is any connection between those bunches, and being out of\none's wits, I cannot say, but I myself entertain a weakness for them.\nIndeed, I love the cedar, anyhow--its naked ruggedness, its just\npalpable odor, (so different from the perfumer's best,) its silence,\nits equable acceptance of winter's cold and summer's heat, of rain or\ndrouth--its shelter to me from those, at times--its associations--(well,\nI never could explain _why_ I love anybody, or anything.) The service I\nnow specially owe to the cedar is, while I cast around for a name for my\nproposed collection, hesitating, puzzled--after rejecting a long, long\nstring, I lift my eyes, and lo! the very term I want. At any rate, I go\nno further--I tire in the search. I take what some invisible kind spirit\nhas put before me. Besides, who shall say there is not affinity enough\nbetween (at least the bundle of sticks that produced) many of these\npieces, or granulations, and those blue berries? their uselessness\ngrowing wild--a certain aroma of Nature I would so like to have in\nmy pages--the thin soil whence they come--their content in being let\nalone--their stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions, (this\nlatter the nearest, dearest trait affinity of all.)\n\nThen reader dear, in conclusion, as to the point of the name for the\npresent collection, let us be satisfied to _have_ a name--something to\nidentify and bind it together, to concrete all its vegetable, mineral,\npersonal memoranda, abrupt raids of criticism, crude gossip of\nphilosophy, varied sands and clumps--without bothering ourselves because\ncertain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under\ntheir own name with entire fitness or amiability. (It is a profound,\nvexatious never-explicable matter--this of names. I have been exercised\ndeeply about it my whole life.[11])\n\nAfter all of which the name \"Cedar-Plums Like\" got its nose put out of\njoint; but I cannot afford to throw away what I pencill'd down the\nlane there, under the shelter of my old friend, one warm October noon.\nBesides, it wouldn't be civil to the cedar tree.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[11] In the pocket of my receptacle-book I find a list of suggested and\nrejected names for this volume, or parts of it--such as the following:\n\n              _As the wild bee hums in May,\n              & August mulleins grow,\n              & Winter snow-flakes fall,\n              & stars in the sky roll round._\n\n             _Away from Books--away from Art,\n             Now for the Day and Night--the lessons done,\n             Now for the Sun and Stars._\n\n    _Notes of a Half-Paralytic,         As Voices in the Dusk, from\n    Week in and Week out,               Speakers far or hid,\n    Embers of Ending Days,              Autochthons....Embryons,\n    Ducks and Drakes,                   Wing-and-Wing,\n    Flood Tide and Ebb,                 Notes and Recalles.\n    Gossip at Early Candle-light,       Only Mulleins and Bumble-Bees,\n    Echoes and Escapades,               Pond-Babble....Tete-a-Tetes,\n    Such as I....Evening Dews,          Echoes of a Life in the 19th\n    Notes and Writing a Book,             Century in the New World,\n    Far and Near at 63,                 Flanges of Fifty Years,\n    Drifts and Cumulus,                 Abandons....Hurry Notes,\n    Maize-Tassels....Kindlings,         A Life-Mosaic....Native Moments,\n    Fore and Aft....Vestibules,         Types and Semi-Tones,\n    Scintilla at 60 and after,          Oddments....Sand-Drifts,\n    Sands on the Shores of 64,          Again and Again._\n\n\nDEATH OF THOMAS CARLYLE\n\n_Feb. 10, '81_.--And so the flame of the lamp, after long wasting and\nflickering, has gone out entirely.\n\nAs a representative author, a literary figure, no man else will bequeath\nto the future more significant hints of our stormy era, its fierce\nparadoxes, its din, and its struggling parturition periods, than\nCarlyle. He belongs to our own branch of the stock too; neither Latin\nnor Greek, but altogether Gothic. Rugged, mountainous, volcanic, he\nwas himself more a French revolution than any of his volumes. In some\nrespects, so far in the Nineteenth century, the best equipt, keenest\nmind, even from the college point of view, of all Britain; only he had\nan ailing body. Dyspepsia is to be traced in every page, and now and\nthen fills the page. One may include among the lessons of his life--even\nthough that life stretch'd to amazing length--how behind the tally of\ngenius and morals stands the stomach, and gives a sort of casting vote.\n\nTwo conflicting agonistic elements seem to have contended in the\nman, sometimes pulling him different ways like wild horses. He was a\ncautious, conservative Scotchman, fully aware what a foetid gas-bag\nmuch of modern radicalism is; but then his great heart demanded reform,\ndemanded change--often terribly at odds with his scornful brain. No\nauthor ever put so much wailing and despair into his books, sometimes\npalpable, oftener latent. He reminds me of that passage in Young's poems\nwhere as death presses closer and closer for his prey, the soul rushes\nhither and thither, appealing, shrieking, berating, to escape the\ngeneral doom.\n\nOf short-comings, even positive blur-spots, from an American point of\nview, he had serious share.\n\nNot for his merely literary merit, (though that was great)--not as\n\"maker of books,\" but as launching into the self-complacent atmosphere\nof our days a rasping, questioning, dislocating agitation and shock, is\nCarlyle's final value. It is time the English-speaking peoples had some\ntrue idea about the verteber of genius, namely power. As if they must\nalways have it cut and bias'd to the fashion, like a lady's cloak! What\na needed service he performs! How he shakes our comfortable reading\ncircles with a touch of the old Hebraic anger and prophecy--and indeed\nit is just the same. Not Isaiah himself more scornful, more threatening:\n\"The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under\nfeet: And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley\nshall be a fading flower.\" (The word prophecy is much misused; it seems\nnarrow'd to prediction merely. That is not the main sense of the Hebrew\nword translated \"prophet;\" it means one whose mind bubbles up and pours\nforth as a fountain, from inner, divine spontaneities revealing God.\nPrediction is a very minor part of prophecy. The great matter is to\nreveal and outpour the God-like suggestions pressing for birth in the\nsoul. This is briefly the doctrine of the Friends or Quakers.)\n\nThen the simplicity and amid ostensible frailty the towering strength\nof this man--a hardy oak knot, you could never wear out--an old\nfarmer dress'd in brown clothes, and not handsome--his very foibles\nfascinating. Who cares that he wrote about Dr. Francia, and \"Shooting\nNiagara\"--and \"the Nigger Question,\"--and didn't at all admire our\nUnited States? (I doubt if he ever thought or said half as bad words\nabout us as we deserve.) How he splashes like leviathan in the seas of\nmodern literature and politics! Doubtless, respecting the latter, one\nneeds first to realize, from actual observation, the squalor, vice and\ndoggedness ingrain'd in the bulk-population of the British islands, with\nthe red tape, the fatuity, the flunkeyism everywhere, to understand the\nlast meaning in his pages. Accordingly, though he was no chartist or\nradical, I consider Carlyle's by far the most indignant comment or\nprotest anent the fruits of feudalism to-day in Great Britain--the\nincreasing poverty and degradation of the homeless, landless twenty\nmillions, while a few thousands, or rather a few hundreds, possess the\nentire soil, the money, and the fat berths. Trade and shipping, and\nclubs and culture, and prestige, and guns, and a fine select class of\ngentry and aristocracy, with every modern improvement, cannot begin to\nsalve or defend such stupendous hoggishness.\n\nThe way to test how much he has left his country were to consider,\nor try to consider, for a moment, the array of British thought, the\nresultant _ensemble_ of the last fifty years, as existing to-day, _but\nwith Carlyle left out_. It would be like an army with no artillery. The\nshow were still a gay and rich one--Byron, Scott, Tennyson, and many\nmore--horsemen and rapid infantry, and banners flying--but the last\nheavy roar so dear to the ear of the train'd soldier, and that settles\nfate and victory, would be lacking.\n\nFor the last three years we in America have had transmitted glimpses of\na thin-bodied, lonesome, wifeless, childless, very old man, lying on\na sofa, kept out of bed by indomitable will, but, of late, never well\nenough to take the open air. I have noted this news from time to time\nin brief descriptions in the papers. A week ago I read such an item just\nbefore I started out for my customary evening stroll between eight\nand nine. In the fine cold night, unusually clear, (Feb. 5, '81,) as\nI walk'd some open grounds adjacent, the condition of Carlyle, and his\napproaching--perhaps even then actual--death, filled me with thoughts\neluding statement, and curiously blending with the scene. The planet\nVenus, an hour high in the west, with all her volume and lustre\nrecover'd, (she has been shorn and languid for nearly a year,) including\nan additional sentiment I never noticed before--not merely voluptuous,\nPaphian, steeping, fascinating--now with calm commanding seriousness and\nhauteur--the Milo Venus now. Upward to the zenith, Jupiter, Saturn, and\nthe moon past her quarter, trailing in procession, with the Pleiades\nfollowing, and the constellation Taurus, and red Aldebaran. Not a cloud\nin heaven. Orion strode through the southeast, with his glittering\nbelt--and a trifle below hung the sun of the night, Sirius. Every star\ndilated, more vitreous, nearer than usual. Not as in some clear nights\nwhen the larger stars entirely outshine the rest. Every little star or\ncluster just as distinctly visible, and just as nigh. Berenice's hair\nshowing every gem, and new ones. To the northeast and north the Sickle,\nthe Goat and kids, Cassiopeia, Castor and Pollux, and the two Dippers.\nWhile through the whole of this silent indescribable show, inclosing\nand bathing my whole receptivity, ran the thought of Carlyle dying. (To\nsoothe and spiritualize, and, as far as may be, solve the mysteries of\ndeath and genius, consider them under the stars at midnight.)\n\nAnd now that he has gone hence, can it be that Thomas Carlyle, soon to\nchemically dissolve in ashes and by winds, remains an identity still?\nIn ways perhaps eluding all the statements, lore and speculations of ten\nthousand years--eluding all possible statements to mortal sense--does he\nyet exist, a definite, vital being, a spirit, an individual--perhaps\nnow wafted in space among those stellar systems, which, suggestive and\nlimitless as they are, merely edge more limitless, far more suggestive\nsystems? I have no doubt of it. In silence, of a fine night, such\nquestions are answer'd to the soul, the best answers that can be given.\nWith me, too, when depress'd by some specially sad event, or tearing\nproblem, I wait till I go out under the stars for the last voiceless\nsatisfaction.\n\n\nCARLYLE FROM AMERICAN POINTS OF VIEW\n\n_Later Thoughts and Jottings_\n\nThere is surely at present an inexplicable _rapport_ (all the more\npiquant from its contradictoriness) between that deceas'd author and our\nUnited States of America--no matter whether it lasts or not[13] As we\nWesterners assume definite shape, and result in formations and fruitage\nunknown before, it is curious with what a new sense our eyes turn to\nrepresentative outgrowths of crises and personages in the Old World.\nBeyond question, since Carlyle's death, and the publication of Froude's\nmemoirs, not only the interest in his books, but every personal bit\nregarding the famous Scotchman--his dyspepsia, his buffetings, his\nparentage, his paragon of a wife, his career in Edinburgh, in the\nlonesome nest on Craigenputtock moor, and then so many years in\nLondon--is probably wider and livelier to-day in this country than\nin his own land. Whether I succeed or no, I, too, reaching across the\nAtlantic and taking the man's dark fortune-telling of humanity and\npolitics, would offset it all, (such is the fancy that comes to me,)\nby a far more profound horoscope-casting of those themes--G. F.\nHegel's.[14]\n\nFirst, about a chance, a never-fulfill'd vacuity of this pale cast of\nthought--this British Hamlet from Cheyne row, more puzzling than the\nDanish one, with his contrivances for settling the broken and spavin'd\njoints of the world's government, especially its democratic dislocation.\nCarlyle's grim fate was cast to live and dwell in, and largely embody,\nthe parturition agony and qualms of the old order, amid crowded\naccumulations of ghastly morbidity, giving birth to the new.\n\nBut conceive of him (or his parents before him) coming to America,\nrecuperated by the cheering realities and activity of our people and\ncountry--growing up and delving face-to-face resolutely among us here,\nespecially at the West--inhaling and exhaling our limitless air and\neligibilities--devoting his mind to the theories and developments\nof this Republic amid its practical facts as exemplified in Kansas,\nMissouri, Illinois, Tennessee, or Louisiana. I say _facts_, and\nface-to-face confrontings--so different from books, and all those\nquiddities and mere reports in the libraries, upon which the man (it\nwas wittily said of him at the age of thirty, that there was no one in\nScotland who had glean'd so much and seen so little,) almost wholly fed,\nand which even his sturdy and vital mind but reflected at best.\n\nSomething of the sort narrowly escaped happening. In 1835, after more\nthan a dozen years of trial and non-success, the author of \"Sartor\nResartus\" removing to London, very poor, a confirmed hypochondriac,\n\"Sartor\" universally scoffed at, no literary prospects ahead,\ndeliberately settled on one last casting throw of the literary\ndice--resolv'd to compose and launch forth a book on the subject of\n_the French Revolution_--and if that won no higher guerdon or prize than\nhitherto, to sternly abandon the trade of author forever, and emigrate\nfor good to America. But the venture turn'd out a lucky one, and there\nwas no emigration.\n\nCarlyle's work in the sphere of literature as he commenced and carried\nit out, is the same in one or two leading respects that Immanuel\nKant's was in speculative philosophy. But the Scotchman had none of the\nstomachic phlegm and never-perturb'd placidity of the Konigsberg sage,\nand did not, like the latter, understand his own limits, and stop when\nhe got to the end of them. He clears away jungle and poisonvines and\nunderbrush--at any rate hacks valiantly at them, smiting hip and thigh.\nKant did the like in his sphere, and it was all he profess'd to do;\nhis labors have left the ground fully prepared ever since--and greater\nservice was probably never perform'd by mortal man. But the pang and\nhiatus of Carlyle seem to me to consist in the evidence everywhere that\namid a whirl of fog and fury and cross-purposes, he firmly believ'd he\nhad a clue to the medication of the world's ills, and that his bounden\nmission was to exploit it.[15]\n\nThere were two anchors, or sheet-anchors, for steadying, as a last\nresort, the Carlylean ship. One will be specified presently. The other,\nperhaps the main, was only to be found in some mark'd form of personal\nforce, an extreme degree of competent urge and will, a man or men \"born\nto command.\" Probably there ran through every vein and current of the\nScotchman's blood something that warm'd up to this kind of trait and\ncharacter above aught else in the world, and which makes him in my\nopinion the chief celebrater and promulger of it in literature--more\nthan Plutarch, more than Shakspere. The great masses of humanity stand\nfor nothing--at least nothing but nebulous raw material; only the big\nplanets and shining suns for him. To ideas almost invariably languid or\ncold, a number-one forceful personality was sure to rouse his eulogistic\npassion and savage joy. In such case, even the standard of duty\nhereinafter rais'd, was to be instantly lower'd and vail'd. All that\nis comprehended under the terms republicanism and democracy were\ndistasteful to him from the first, and as he grew older they became\nhateful and contemptible. For an undoubtedly candid and penetrating\nfaculty such as his, the bearings he persistently ignored were\nmarvellous. For instance, the promise, nay certainty of the democratic\nprinciple, to each and every State of the current world, not so much\nof helping it to perfect legislators and executives, but as the only\neffectual method for surely, however slowly, training people on a large\nscale toward voluntarily ruling and managing themselves (the ultimate\naim of political and all other development)--to gradually reduce the\nfact of _governing_ to its minimum, and to subject all its staffs\nand their doings to the telescopes and microscopes of committees and\nparties--and greatest of all, to afford (not stagnation and obedient\ncontent, which went well enough with the feudalism and ecclesiasticism\nof the antique and medieval world, but) a vast and sane and recurrent\nebb and tide action for those floods of the great deep that have\nhenceforth palpably burst forever their old bounds--seem never to have\nenter'd Carlyle's thought. It was splendid how he refus'd any compromise\nto the last. He was curiously antique. In that harsh, picturesque, most\npotent voice and figure, one seems to be carried back from the present\nof the British islands more than two thousand years, to the range\nbetween Jerusalem and Tarsus. His fullest best biographer justly says of\nhim:\n\nHe was a teacher and a prophet, in the Jewish sense of the word. The\nprophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah have become a part of the permanent\nspiritual inheritance of mankind, because events proved that they had\ninterpreted correctly the sign of their own times, and their prophecies\nwere fulfill'd. Carlyle, like them, believ'd that he had a special\nmessage to deliver to the present age. Whether he was correct in that\nbelief, and whether his message was a true message, remains to be seen.\nHe has told us that our most cherish'd ideas of political liberty, with\ntheir kindred corollaries, are mere illusions, and that the progress\nwhich has seem'd to go along with them is a progress towards anarchy\nand social dissolution. If he was wrong, he has misused his powers. The\nprinciples of his teachings are false. He has offer'd himself as a guide\nupon a road of which he had no knowledge; and his own desire for himself\nwould be the speediest oblivion both of his person and his works. If, on\nthe other hand, he has been right; if, like his great predecessors,\nhe has read truly the tendencies of this modern age of ours, and his\nteaching is authenticated by facts, then Carlyle, too, will take his\nplace among the inspired seers.\n\nTo which I add an amendment that under no circumstances, and no matter\nhow completely time and events disprove his lurid vaticinations, should\nthe English-speaking world forget this man, nor fail to hold in honor\nhis unsurpass'd conscience, his unique method, and his honest fame.\nNever were convictions more earnest and genuine. Never was there less\nof a flunkey or temporizer. Never had political progressivism a foe it\ncould more heartily respect.\n\nThe second main point of Carlyle's utterance was the idea of _duty being\ndone_. (It is simply a new codicil--if it be particularly new, which\nis by no means certain--on the time-honor'd bequest of dynasticism,\nthe mould-eaten rules of legitimacy and kings.) He seems to have been\nimpatient sometimes to madness when reminded by persons who thought\nat least as deeply as himself, that this formula, though precious, is\nrather a vague one, and that there are many other considerations to a\nphilosophical estimate of each and every department either.\n\nAltogether, I don't know anything more amazing than these persistent\nstrides and throbbings so far through our Nineteenth century of\nperhaps its biggest, sharpest, and most erudite brain, in defiance\nand discontent with everything; contemptuously ignoring, (either from\nconstitutional inaptitude, ignorance itself, or more likely because he\ndemanded a definite cure-all here and now,) the only solace and solvent\nto be had.\n\nThere is, apart from mere intellect, in the make-up of every superior\nhuman identity, (in its moral completeness, considered as _ensemble_,\nnot for that moral alone, but for the whole being, including physique,)\na wondrous something that realizes without argument, frequently without\nwhat is called education, (though I think it the goal and apex of all\neducation deserving the name)--an intuition of the absolute balance, in\ntime and space, of the whole of this multifarious, mad chaos of fraud,\nfrivolity, hoggishness--this revel of fools, and incredible make-believe\nand general unsettledness, we call _the world_; a soul-sight of that\ndivine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of\nthings, all history and time, and all events, however trivial, however\nmomentous, like a leash'd dog in the hand of the hunter. Such soul-sight\nand root-centre for the mind--mere optimism explains only the surface\nor fringe of it--Carlyle was mostly, perhaps entirely without. He seems\ninstead to have been haunted in the play of his mental action by a\nspectre, never entirely laid from first to last, (Greek scholars,\nI believe, find the same mocking and fantastic apparition attending\nAristophanes, his comedies,)--the spectre of world-destruction.\n\nHow largest triumph or failure in human life, in war or peace, may\ndepend on some little hidden centrality, hardly more than a drop of\nblood, a pulse-beat, or a breath of air! It is certain that all these\nweighty matters, democracy in America, Carlyleism, and the temperament\nfor deepest political or literary exploration, turn on a simple point in\nspeculative philosophy.\n\nThe most profound theme that can occupy the mind of man--the problem\non whose solution science, art, the bases and pursuits of nations, and\neverything else, including intelligent human happiness, (here to-day,\n1882, New York, Texas, California, the same as all times, all lands,)\nsubtly and finally resting, depends for competent outset and argument,\nis doubtless involved in the query: What is the fusing explanation and\ntie--what the relation between the (radical, democratic) Me, the human\nidentity of understanding, emotions, spirit, &c., on the one side, of\nand with the (conservative) Not Me, the whole of the material objective\nuniverse and laws, with what is behind them in time and space, on the\nother side? Immanuel Kant, though he explain'd or partially explain'd,\nas may be said, the laws of the human understanding, left this question\nan open one. Schelling's answer, or suggestion of answer, is (and very\nvaluable and important, as far as it goes,) that the same general and\nparticular intelligence, passion, even the standards of right and wrong,\nwhich exist in a conscious and formulated state in man, exist in an\nunconscious state, or in perceptible analogies, throughout the entire\nuniverse of external Nature, in all its objects large or small, and all\nits movements and processes--thus making the impalpable human mind,\nand concrete nature, notwithstanding their duality and separation,\nconvertible, and in centrality and essence one. But G. F. Hegel's fuller\nstatement of the matter probably remains the last best word that has\nbeen said upon it, up to date. Substantially adopting the scheme just\nepitomized, he so carries it out and fortifies it and merges everything\nin it, with certain serious gaps now for the first time fill'd, that it\nbecomes a coherent metaphysical system, and substantial answer (as far\nas there can be any answer) to the foregoing question--a system which,\nwhile I distinctly admit that the brain of the future may add to,\nrevise, and even entirely reconstruct, at any rate beams forth\nto-day, in its entirety, illuminating the thought of the universe, and\nsatisfying the mystery thereof to the human mind, with a more consoling\nscientific assurance than any yet.\n\nAccording to Hegel the whole earth, (an old nucleus-thought, as in the\nVedas, and no doubt before, but never hitherto brought so absolutely to\nthe front, fully surcharged with modern scientism and facts, and made\nthe sole entrance to each and all,) with its infinite variety, the\npast, the surroundings of to-day, or what may happen in the future,\nthe contrarieties of material with spiritual, and of natural with\nartificial, are all, to the eye of the _ensemblist_, but necessary sides\nand unfoldings, different steps or links, in the endless process\nof Creative thought, which, amid numberless apparent failures and\ncontradictions, is held together by central and never-broken unity--not\ncontradictions or failures at all, but radiations of one consistent\nand eternal purpose; the whole mass of everything steadily, unerringly\ntending and flowing toward the permanent _utile_ and _morale_, as rivers\nto oceans. As life is the whole law and incessant effort of the visible\nuniverse, and death only the other or invisible side of the same, so the\n_utile_, so truth, so health are the continuous-immutable laws of the\nmoral universe, and vice and disease, with all their perturbations, are\nbut transient, even if ever so prevalent expressions.\n\nTo politics throughout, Hegel applies the like catholic standard and\nfaith. Not any one party, or any one form of government, is absolutely\nand exclusively true. Truth consists in the just relations of objects to\neach other. A majority or democracy may rule as outrageously and do as\ngreat harm as an oligarchy or despotism--though far less likely to\ndo so. But the great evil is either a violation of the relations just\nreferr'd to, or of the moral law. The specious, the unjust, the cruel,\nand what is called the unnatural, though not only permitted but in a\ncertain sense, (like shade to light,) inevitable in the divine scheme,\nare by the whole constitution of that scheme, partial, inconsistent,\ntemporary, and though having ever so great an ostensible majority, are\ncertainly destin'd to failures, after causing great suffering.\n\nTheology, Hegel translates into science.[16] All apparent contradictions\nin the statement of the Deific nature by different ages, nations,\nchurches, points of view, are but fractional and imperfect expressions\nof one essential unity, from which they all proceed--crude endeavors or\ndistorted parts, to be regarded both as distinct and united. In short\n(to put it in our own form, or summing up,) that thinker or analyzer\nor overlooker who by an inscrutable combination of train'd wisdom and\nnatural intuition most fully accepts in perfect faith the moral unity\nand sanity of the creative scheme, in history, science, and all life\nand time, present and future, is both the truest cosmical devotee or\nreligioso, and the profoundest philosopher. While he who, by the spell\nof himself and his circumstance, sees darkness and despair in the sum\nof the workings of God's providence, and who, in that, denies or\nprevaricates, is, no matter how much piety plays on his lips, the most\nradical sinner and infidel.\n\nI am the more assured in recounting Hegel a little freely here,[17] not\nonly for offsetting the Carlylean letter and spirit-cutting it out\nall and several from the very roots, and below the roots--but to\ncounterpoise, since the late death and deserv'd apotheosis of Darwin,\nthe tenets of the evolutionists. Unspeakably precious as those are to\nbiology, and henceforth indispensable to a right aim and estimate in\nstudy, they neither comprise or explain everything--and the last word or\nwhisper still remains to be breathed, after the utmost of those\nclaims, floating high and forever above them all, and above technical\nmetaphysics. While the contributions which German Kant and Fichte and\nSchelling and Hegel have bequeath'd to humanity--and which English\nDarwin has also in his field--are indispensable to the erudition of\nAmerica's future, I should say that in all of them, and the best of\nthem, when compared with the lightning flashes and flights of the old\nprophets and _exaltes_, the spiritual poets and poetry of all lands,\n(as in the Hebrew Bible,) there seems to be, nay certainly is, something\nlacking--something cold, a failure to satisfy the deepest emotions\nof the soul--a want of living glow, fondness, warmth, which the old\n_exaltes_ and poets supply, and which the keenest modern philosophers so\nfar do not.\n\nUpon the whole, and for our purposes, this man's name certainly belongs\non the list with the just-specified, first-class moral physicians of\nour current era--and with Emerson and two or three others--though\nhis prescription is drastic, and perhaps destructive, while theirs is\nassimilating, normal and tonic. Feudal at the core, and mental offspring\nand radiation of feudalism as are his books, they afford ever-valuable\nlessons and affinities to democratic America. Nations or individuals, we\nsurely learn deepest from unlikeness, from a sincere opponent, from the\nlight thrown even scornfully on dangerous spots and liabilities. (Michel\nAngelo invoked heaven's special protection against his friends and\naffectionate flatterers; palpable foes he could manage for himself.) In\nmany particulars Carlyle was indeed, as Froude terms him, one of those\nfar-off Hebraic utterers, a new Micah or Habbakuk. His words at times\nbubble forth with abysmic inspiration. Always precious, such men; as\nprecious now as any time. His rude, rasping, taunting, contradictory\ntones--what ones are more wanted amid the supple, polish'd,\nmoney--worshipping, Jesus-and-Judas-equalizing, suffrage-sovereignty\nechoes of current America? He has lit up our Nineteenth century with the\nlight of a powerful, penetrating, and perfectly honest intellect of\nthe first class, turn'd on British and European politics, social life,\nliterature, and representative personages--thoroughly dissatisfied with\nall, and mercilessly exposing the illness of all. But while he announces\nthe malady, and scolds and raves about it, he himself, born and bred in\nthe same atmosphere, is a mark'd illustration of it.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n[13] It will be difficult for the future--judging by his books, personal\ndissympathies, &c.,--to account for the deep hold this author has taken\non the present age, and the way he has color'd its method and thought.\nI am certainly at a loss to account for it all as affecting myself.\nBut there could be no view, or even partial picture, of the middle and\nlatter part of our Nineteenth century, that did not markedly include\nThomas Carlyle. In his case (as so many others, literary productions,\nworks of art, personal identities, events,) there has been an impalpable\nsomething more effective than the palpable. Then I find no better text,\n(it is always important to have a definite, special, even oppositional,\nliving man to start from,) for sending out certain speculations\nand comparisons for home use. Let us see what they amount to--those\nreactionary doctrines, fears, scornful analyses of democracy--even from\nthe most erudite and sincere mind of Europe.\n\n[14] Not the least mentionable part of the case, (a streak, it may\nbe, of that humor with which history and fate love to contrast their\ngravity,) is that although neither of my great authorities during their\nlives consider'd the United States worthy of serious mention, all the\nprincipal works of both might not inappropriately be this day collected\nand bound up under the conspicuous title: _Speculations for the use of\nNorth America, and Democracy there with the relations of the same to\nMetaphysics, including Lessons and Warnings (encouragements too, and of\nthe vastest,) from the Old World to the New._\n\n[15] I hope I shall not myself fall into the error I charge upon him, of\nprescribing a specific for indispensable evils. My utmost pretension is\nprobably but to offset that old claim of the exclusively curative power\nof first-class individual men, as leaders and rulers, by the claims,\nand general movement and result, of ideas. Something of the latter kind\nseems to me the distinctive theory of America, of democracy, and of the\nmodern--or rather, I should say, it _is_ democracy, and _is_ the modern.\n\n[16] I am much indebted to J. Gostick's abstract.\n\n[17] I have deliberately repeated it all, not only in offset to Carlyle'\ns everlurking pessimism and world-decadence, but as presenting the most\nthoroughly _American points of view_ I know. In my opinion the above\nformulas of Hegel are an essential and crowning justification of New\nWorld democracy in the creative realms of time and space. There is that\nabout them which only the vastness, the multiplicity and the vitality\nof America would seem able to comprehend, to give scope and illustration\nto, or to be fit for, or even originate. It is strange to me that they\nwere born in Germany, or in the old world at all. While a Carlyle, I\nshould say, is quite the legitimate European product to be expected.\n\n\nA COUPLE OF OLD FRIENDS--A COLERIDGE BIT\n\n_Latter April_.--Have run down in my country haunt for a couple of days,\nand am spending them by the pond. I had already discover'd my kingfisher\nhere (but only one--the mate not here yet.) This fine bright morning,\ndown by the creek, he has come out for a spree, circling, flirting,\nchirping at a round rate. While I am writing these lines he is\ndisporting himself in scoots and rings over the wider parts of the pond,\ninto whose surface he dashes, once or twice making a loud _souse_--the\nspray flying in the sun--beautiful! I see his white and dark-gray\nplumage and peculiar shape plainly, as he has deign'd to come very near\nme. The noble, graceful bird! Now he is sitting on the limb of an old\ntree, high up, bending over the water--seems to be looking at me while I\nmemorandize. I almost fancy he knows me. _Three days later._--My second\nkingfisher is here with his (or her) mate. I saw the two together flying\nand whirling around. I had heard, in the distance, what I thought was\nthe clear rasping staccato of the birds several times already--but I\ncouldn't be sure the notes came from both until I saw them together.\nTo-day at noon they appear'd, but apparently either on business, or for\na little limited exercise only. No wild frolic now, full of free fun and\nmotion, up and down for an hour. Doubtless, now they have cares, duties,\nincubation responsibilities. The frolics are deferr'd till summer-close.\n\nI don't know as I can finish to-day's memorandum better than with\nColeridge's lines, curiously appropriate in more ways than one:\n\n    All Nature seems at work--slugs leave their lair,\n    The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing,\n    And winter, slumbering in the open air,\n    Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring;\n    And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing,\n    Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.\n\n\nA WEEK'S VISIT TO BOSTON\n\n_May 1, '81._--Seems as if all the ways and means of American\ntravel to-day had been settled, not only with reference to speed and\ndirectness, but for the comfort of women, children, invalids, and old\nfellows like me. I went on by a through train that runs daily from\nWashington to the Yankee metropolis without change. You get in a\nsleeping-car soon after dark in Philadelphia, and after ruminating an\nhour or two, have your bed made up if you like, draw the curtains,\nand go to sleep in it--fly on through Jersey to New York--hear in your\nhalf-slumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or two--are unconsciously\ntoted from Jersey City by a midnight steamer around the Battery and\nunder the big bridge to the track of the New Haven road--resume your\nflight eastward, and early the next morning you wake up in Boston. All\nof which was my experience. I wanted to go to the Revere house. A tall\nunknown gentleman, (a fellow-passenger on his way to Newport he told\nme, I had just chatted a few moments before with him,) assisted me out\nthrough the depot crowd, procured a hack, put me in it with my traveling\nbag, saying smilingly and quietly, \"Now I want you to let this be _my_\nride,\" paid the driver, and before I could remonstrate bow'd himself\noff.\n\nThe occasion of my jaunt, I suppose I had better say here, was for a\npublic reading of \"the death of Abraham Lincoln\" essay, on the sixteenth\nanniversary of that tragedy; which reading duly came off, night of\nApril 15. Then I linger'd a week in Boston--felt pretty well (the mood\npropitious, my paralysis lull'd)--went around everywhere, and saw all\nthat was to be seen, especially human beings. Boston's immense material\ngrowth--commerce, finance, commission stores, the plethora of goods, the\ncrowded streets and sidewalks--made of course the first surprising show.\nIn my trip out West, last year, I thought the wand of future prosperity,\nfuture empire, must soon surely be wielded by St. Louis, Chicago,\nbeautiful Denver, perhaps San Francisco; but I see the said wand\nstretch'd out just as decidedly in Boston, with just as much certainty\nof staying; evidences of copious capital--indeed no centre of the New\nWorld ahead of it, (half the big railroads in the West are built with\nYankees' money, and they take the dividends.) Old Boston with its zigzag\nstreets and multitudinous angles, (crush up a sheet of letter-paper\nin your hand, throw it down, stamp it flat, and that is a map of old\nBoston)--new Boston with its miles upon miles of large and costly\nhouses--Beacon street, Commonwealth avenue, and a hundred others. But\nthe best new departures and expansions of Boston, and of all the cities\nof New England, are in another direction.\n\n\nTHE BOSTON OF TO-DAY\n\nIn the letters we get from Dr. Schliemann (interesting but fishy) about\nhis excavations there in the far-off Homeric area, I notice cities,\nruins, &c., as he digs them out of their graves, are certain to be in\nlayers--that is to say, upon the foundation of an old concern, very\nfar down indeed, is always another city or set of ruins, and upon\nthat another superadded--and sometimes upon that still another--each\nrepresenting either a long or rapid stage of growth and development,\ndifferent from its predecessor, but unerringly growing out of and\nresting on it. In the moral, emotional, heroic, and human growths, (the\nmain of a race in my opinion,) something of this kind has certainly\ntaken place in Boston. The New England metropolis of to-day may\nbe described as sunny, (there is something else that makes warmth,\nmastering even winds and meteorologies, though those are not to be\nsneez'd at,) joyous, receptive, full of ardor, sparkle, a certain\nelement of yearning, magnificently tolerant, yet not to be fool'd; fond\nof good eating and drinking--costly in costume as its purse can buy;\nand all through its best average of houses, streets, people, that\nsubtle something (generally thought to be climate, but it is not--it is\nsomething indefinable in the _race_, the turn of its development) which\neffuses behind the whirl of animation, study, business, a happy and\njoyous public spirit, as distinguish'd from a sluggish and saturnine\none. Makes me think of the glints we get (as in Symonds's books) of the\njolly old Greek cities. Indeed there is a good deal of the Hellenic in\nB., and the people are getting handsomer too--padded out, with freer\nmotions, and with color in their faces. I never saw (although this is\nnot Greek) so many _fine-looking gray-hair'd women_. At my lecture\nI caught myself pausing more than once to look at them, plentiful\neverywhere through the audience--healthy and wifely and motherly, and\nwonderfully charming and beautiful--I think such as no time or land but\nours could show.\n\n\nMY TRIBUTE TO FOUR POETS\n\n_April 16_.--A short but pleasant visit to Longfellow. I am not one\nof the calling kind, but as the author of \"Evangeline\" kindly took the\ntrouble to come and see me three years ago in Camden, where I was ill,\nI felt not only the impulse of my own pleasure on that occasion, but a\nduty. He was the only particular eminence I called on in Boston, and I\nshall not soon forget his lit-up face and glowing warmth and courtesy,\nin the modes of what is called the old school.\n\nAnd now just here I feel the impulse to interpolate something about the\nmighty four who stamp this first American century with its birthmarks of\npoetic literature. In a late magazine one of my reviewers, who ought\nto know better, speaks of my \"attitude of contempt and scorn and\nintolerance\" toward the leading poets--of my \"deriding\" them, and\npreaching their \"uselessness.\" If anybody cares to know what I\nthink--and have long thought and avow'd--about them, I am entirely\nwilling to propound. I can't imagine any better luck befalling these\nStates for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from\nEmerson, Longfellow, Bryant, and Whittier. Emerson, to me, stands\nunmistakably at the head, but for the others I am at a loss where to\ngive any precedence. Each illustrious, each rounded, each distinctive.\nEmerson for his sweet, vital-tasting melody, rhym'd philosophy, and\npoems as amber-clear as the honey of the wild bee he loves to sing.\nLongfellow for rich color, graceful forms and incidents--all that makes\nlife beautiful and love refined--competing with the singers of Europe\non their own ground, and, with one exception, better and finer work than\nthat of any of them. Bryant pulsing the first interior verse-throbs of a\nmighty world--bard of the river and the wood, ever conveying a taste of\nopen air, with scents as from hayfields, grapes, birch-borders--always\nlurkingly fond of threnodies--beginning and ending his long career with\nchants of death, with here and there through all, poems, or passages\nof poems, touching the highest universal truths, enthusiasms,\nduties--morals as grim and eternal, if not as stormy and fateful, as\nanything in Eschylus. While in Whittier, with his special themes--(his\noutcropping love of heroism and war, for all his Quakerdom, his verses\nat times like the measur'd step of Cromwell's old veterans)--in Whittier\nlives the zeal, the moral energy, that founded New England--the splendid\nrectitude and ardor of Luther, Milton, George Fox--I must not, dare not,\nsay the wilfulness and narrowness--though doubtless the world needs\nnow, and always will need, almost above all, just such narrowness and\nwilfulness.\n\n\nMILLET'S PICTURES LAST ITEMS\n\n_April 18_.--Went out three or four miles to the house of Quincy Shaw,\nto see a collection of J. F. Millet's pictures. Two rapt hours. Never\nbefore have I been so penetrated by this kind of expression. I stood\nlong and long before \"the Sower.\" I believe what the picture-men\ndesignate \"the first Sower,\" as the artist executed a second copy, and\na third, and, some think, improved in each. But I doubt it. There is\nsomething in this that could hardly be caught again--a sublime murkiness\nand original pent fury. Besides this masterpiece, there were many\nothers, (I shall never forget the simple evening scene, \"Watering the\nCow,\") all inimitable, all perfect as pictures, works of mere art; and\nthen it seem'd to me, with that last impalpable ethic purpose from the\nartist (most likely unconscious to himself) which I am always looking\nfor. To me all of them told the full story of what went before and\nnecessitated the great French revolution--the long precedent crushing\nof the masses of a heroic people into the earth, in abject poverty,\nhunger--every right denied, humanity attempted to be put back for\ngenerations--yet Nature's force, titanic here, the stronger and hardier\nfor that repression--waiting terribly to break forth, revengeful--the\npressure on the dykes, and the bursting at last--the storming of the\nBastile--the execution of the king and queen--the tempest of massacres\nand blood. Yet who can wonder?\n\n    Could we wish humanity different?\n    Could we wish the people made of wood or stone?\n    Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?\n\nThe true France, base of all the rest, is certainly in these pictures. I\ncomprehend \"Field-People Reposing,\" \"the Diggers,\" and \"the Angelus\"\nin this opinion. Some folks always think of the French as a small race,\nfive or five and a half feet high, and ever frivolous and smirking.\nNothing of the sort. The bulk of the personnel of France, before the\nrevolution, was large-sized, serious, industrious as now, and simple.\nThe revolution and Napoleon's wars dwarf'd the standard of human size,\nbut it will come up again. If for nothing else, I should dwell on my\nbrief Boston visit for opening to me the new world of Millet's pictures.\nWill America ever have such an artist out of her own gestation, body,\nsoul?\n\n_Sunday, April 17._--An hour and a half, late this afternoon, in silence\nand half light, in the great nave of Memorial hall, Cambridge, the walls\nthickly cover'd with mural tablets, bearing the names of students and\ngraduates of the university who fell in the secession war.\n\n_April 23._--It was well I got away in fair order, for if I had staid\nanother week I should have been killed with kindness, and with eating\nand drinking.\n\n\nBIRDS--AND A CAUTION\n\n_May 14._--Home again; down temporarily in the Jersey woods. Between 8\nand 9 A.M. a full concert of birds, from different quarters, in keeping\nwith the fresh scent, the peace, the naturalness all around me. I am\nlately noticing the russet-back, size of the robin or a trifle less,\nlight breast and shoulders, with irregular dark stripes--tail long--sits\nhunch'd up by the hour these days, top of a tall bush, or some tree,\nsinging blithely. I often get near and listen, as he seems tame; I like\nto watch the working of his bill and throat, the quaint sidle of his\nbody, and flex of his long tail. I hear the woodpecker, and night and\nearly morning the shuttle of the whip-poor-will--noons, the gurgle of\nthrush delicious, and _meo-o-ow_ of the cat-bird. Many I cannot name;\nbut I do not very particularly seek information. (You must not know too\nmuch, or be too precise or scientific about birds and trees and flowers\nand water-craft; a certain free margin, and even vagueness--perhaps\nignorance, credulity--helps your enjoyment of these things, and of the\nsentiment of feather'd, wooded, river, or marine Nature generally. I\nrepeat it--don't want to know too exactly, or the reasons why. My own\nnotes have been written off-hand in the latitude of middle New Jersey.\nThough they describe what I saw--what appear'd to me--I dare say the\nexpert ornithologist, botanist or entomologist will detect more than one\nslip in them.)\n\n\nSAMPLES OF MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK\n\nI ought not to offer a record of these days, interests, recuperations,\nwithout including a certain old, well-thumb'd common-place book,[18]\nfilled with favorite excerpts, I carried in my pocket for three summers,\nand absorb'd over and over again, when the mood invited. I find so much\nin having a poem or fine suggestion sink into me (a little then goes a\ngreat ways) prepar'd by these vacant-sane and natural influences.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[18] _Samples of my common-place book down at the creek:_\n\nI have--says old Pindar--many swift arrows in my quiver which speak to\nthe wise, though they need an interpreter to the thoughtless. Such a man\nas it takes ages to make, and ages to understand. _H. D.

I._--A good day here, on a jaunt,\namid the sand and salt, a steady breeze setting in from the sea, the sun\nshining, the sedge-odor, the noise of the surf, a mixture of hissing and\nbooming, the milk-white crest curling. I had a leisurely bath and naked\nramble as of old, on the warm-gray shore-sands, my companions off in a\noat in deeper water--(I shouting to them Jupiter's menaces against the\ngods, from Pope's Homer) _July 28--to Long Branch_--8-1/2 A.M., on the\nsteamer \"Plymouth Rock,\" foot of 23d street, New York, for Long\nBranch. Another fine day, fine sights, the shores, the shipping and\nbay--everything comforting to the body and spirit of me. (I find the\nhuman and objective atmosphere of New York city and Brooklyn more\naffiliative to me than any other.) _An hour later_--Still on the\nsteamer, now sniffing the salt very plainly--the long pulsating _swash_\nas our boat steams seaward--the hills of Navesink and many passing\nvessels--the air the best part of all. At Long Branch the bulk of the\nday, stopt at a good hotel, took all very leisurely, had an excellent\ndinner, and then drove for over two hours about the place, especially\nOcean avenue, the finest drive one can imagine, seven or eight miles\nright along the beach. In all directions costly villas, palaces,\nmillionaires--(but few among them I opine like my friend George W.\nChilds, whose personal integrity, generosity, unaffected simplicity, go\nbeyond all worldly wealth.)\n\n\nHOT WEATHER NEW YORK\n\n_August_.--In the big city awhile. Even the height of the dog-days,\nthere is a good deal of fun about New York, if you only avoid fluster,\nand take all the buoyant wholesomeness that offers. More comfort, too,\nthan most folks think. A middle-aged man, with plenty of money in his\npocket, tells me that he has been off for a month to all the swell\nplaces, has disburs'd a small fortune, has been hot and out of kilter\neverywhere, and has return' d home and lived in New York city the last\ntwo weeks quite contented and happy. People forget when it is hot here,\nit is generally hotter still in other places.\n\nNew York is so situated, with the great ozonic brine on both sides, it\ncomprises the most favorable health-chances in the world. (If only the\nsuffocating crowding of some of its tenement houses could be broken\nup.) I find I never sufficiently realized how beautiful are the upper\ntwo-thirds of Manhattan island. I am stopping at Mott Haven, and have\nbeen familiar now for ten days with the region above One-hundredth\nstreet, and along the Harlem river and Washington heights. Am dwelling a\nfew days with my friends Mr. and Mrs. J. H. J., and a merry houseful of\nyoung ladies. Am putting the last touches on the printer's copy of my\nnew volume of \"Leaves of Grass\"--the completed book at last. Work at it\ntwo or three hours, and then go down and loaf along the Harlem river;\nhave just had a good spell of this recreation. The sun sufficiently\nveil'd, a soft south breeze, the river full of small or large shells\n(light taper boats) darting up and down, some singly, now and then\nlong ones with six or eight young fellows practicing--very inspiriting\nsights. Two fine yachts lie anchor'd off the shore. I linger long,\nenjoying the sundown, the glow, the streak'd sky, the heights,\ndistances, shadows. _Aug. 10._--As I haltingly ramble an hour or two\nthis forenoon by the more secluded parts of the shore, or sit under\nan old cedar half way up the hill, the city near in view, many young\nparties gather to bathe or swim, squads of boys, generally twos or\nthrees, some larger ones, along the sand-bottom, or off an old pier\nclose by. A peculiar and pretty carnival--at its height a hundred lads\nor young men, very democratic, but all decent behaving. The laughter,\nvoices, calls, re-responses--the springing and diving of the bathers\nfrom the great string-piece of the decay'd pier, where climb or stand\nlong ranks of them, naked, rose-color'd, with movements, postures ahead\nof any sculpture. To all this, the sun, so bright, the dark-green shadow\nof the hills the other side, the amber-rolling waves, changing as the\ntide comes in to a trans-parent tea-color--the frequent splash of the\nplayful boys, sousing--the glittering drops sparkling, and the good\nwestern breeze blowing.\n\n\nCUSTER'S LAST RALLY\n\nWent to-day to see this just-finish'd painting by John Mulvany, who\nhas been out in far Dakota, on the spot, at the forts, and among the\nfrontiersmen, soldiers and Indians, for the last two years, on purpose\nto sketch it in from reality, or the best that could be got of it. Sat\nfor over an hour before the picture, completely absorb'd in the first\nview. A vast canvas, I should say twenty or twenty-two feet by twelve,\nall crowded, and yet not crowded, conveying such a vivid play of color,\nit takes a little time to get used to it. There are no tricks; there\nis no throwing of shades in masses; it is all at first painfully real,\noverwhelming, needs good nerves to look at it. Forty or fifty figures,\nperhaps more, in full finish and detail in the mid-ground, with three\ntimes that number, or more, through the rest--swarms upon swarms of\nsavage Sioux, in their war-bonnets, frantic, mostly on ponies, driving\nthrough the background, through the smoke, like a hurricane of demons.\nA dozen of the figures are wonderful. Altogether a western, autochthonic\nphase of America, the frontiers, culminating, typical, deadly, heroic to\nthe uttermost--nothing in the books like it, nothing in Homer, nothing\nin Shakspere; more grim and sublime than either, all native, all our\nown, and all a fact. A great lot of muscular, tan-faced men, brought\nto bay under terrible circumstances--death ahold of them, yet every man\nundaunted, not one losing his head, wringing out every cent of the pay\nbefore they sell their lives. Custer (his hair cut short stands in\nthe middle), with dilated eye and extended arm, aiming a huge cavalry\npistol. Captain Cook is there, partially wounded, blood on the\nwhite handkerchief around his head, aiming his carbine coolly, half\nkneeling--(his body was afterwards found close by Custer's.) The\nslaughter'd or half-slaughter'd horses, for breastworks, make a peculiar\nfeature. Two dead Indians, herculean, lie in the foreground, clutching\ntheir Winchester rifles, very characteristic. The many soldiers, their\nfaces and attitudes, the carbines, the broad-brimm'd western hats, the\npowder-smoke in puffs, the dying horses with their rolling eyes\nalmost human in their agony, the clouds of war-bonneted Sioux in the\nbackground, the figures of Custer and Cook--with indeed the whole scene,\ndreadful, yet with an attraction and beauty that will remain in my\nmemory. With all its color and fierce action, a certain Greek continence\npervades it. A sunny sky and clear light envelop all. There is an\nalmost entire absence of the stock traits of European war pictures. The\nphysiognomy of the work is realistic and Western. I only saw it for an\nhour or so; but it needs to be seen many times--needs to be studied over\nand over again. I could look on such a work at brief intervals all\nmy life without tiring; it is very tonic to me; then it has an ethic\npurpose below all, as all great art must have. The artist said the\nsending of the picture abroad, probably to London, had been talk'd of.\nI advised him if it went abroad to take it to Paris. I think they might\nappreciate it there--nay, they certainly would. Then I would like to\nshow Messieur Crapeau that some things can be done in America as well as\nothers.\n\n\nSOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES--MEMORIES\n\n_Aug. 16._--\"Chalk a big mark for today,\" was one of the sayings of an\nold sportsman-friend of mine, when he had had unusually good luck--come\nhome thoroughly tired, but with satisfactory results of fish or birds.\n\nWell, to-day might warrant such a mark for me. Everything propitious\nfrom the start. An hour's fresh stimulation, coming down ten miles of\nManhattan island by railroad and 8 o'clock stage. Then an excellent\nbreakfast at Pfaff's restaurant, 24th street. Our host himself, an old\nfriend of mine, quickly appear'd on the scene to welcome me and bring\nup the news, and, first opening a big fat bottle of the best wine in\nthe cellar, talk about ante-bellum times, '59 and '60, and the jovial\nsuppers at his then Broadway place, near Bleecker street. Ah, the\nfriends and names and frequenters, those times, that place. Most are\ndead--Ada Clare, Wilkins, Daisy Sheppard, O'Brien, Henry Clapp, Stanley,\nMullin, Wood, Brougham, Arnold--all gone. And there Pfaff and I, sitting\nopposite each other at the little table, gave a remembrance to them in a\nstyle they would have themselves fully confirm'd, namely, big, brimming,\nfill'd-up champagne-glasses, drain'd in abstracted silence, very\nleisurely, to the last drop. (Pfaff is a generous German _restaurateur_,\nsilent, stout, jolly, and I should say the best selecter of champagne in\nAmerica.)\n\n\nA DISCOVERY OF OLD AGE\n\nPerhaps the best is always cumulative. One's eating and drinking one\nwants fresh, and for the nonce, right off, and have done with it--but I\nwould not give a straw for that person or poem, or friend, or city,\nor work of art, that was not more grateful the second time than the\nfirst--and more still the third. Nay, I do not believe any grandest\neligibility ever comes forth at first. In my own experience, (persons,\npoems, places, characters,) I discover the best hardly ever at first,\n(no absolute rule about it, however,) sometimes suddenly bursting\nforth, or stealthily opening to me, perhaps after years of unwitting\nfamiliarity, unappreciation, usage.\n\n\nA VISIT, AT THE LAST, TO R. W. EMERSON\n\n_Concord, Mass._--Out here on a visit--elastic, mellow, Indian-summery\nweather. Came to-day from Boston, (a pleasant ride of 40 minutes by\nsteam, through Somerville, Belmont, Waltham, Stony Brook, and other\nlively towns,) convoy'd by my friend F. B. Sanborn, and to his ample\nhouse, and the kindness and hospitality of Mrs. S. and their fine\nfamily. Am writing this under the shade of some old hickories and elms,\njust after 4 P.M., on the porch, within a stone's throw of the Concord\nriver. Off against me, across stream, on a meadow and side-hill,\nhaymakers are gathering and wagoning-in probably their second or third\ncrop. The spread of emerald-green and brown, the knolls, the score or\ntwo of little haycocks dotting the meadow, the loaded-up wagons, the\npatient horses, the slow-strong action of the men and pitchforks--all in\nthe just-waning afternoon, with patches of yellow sun-sheen, mottled\nby long shadows--a cricket shrilly chirping, herald of the dusk--a boat\nwith two figures noiselessly gliding along the little river, passing\nunder the stone bridge-arch--the slight settling haze of aerial\nmoisture, the sky and the peacefulness expanding in all directions and\noverhead--fill and soothe me.\n\n_Same Evening._--Never had I a better piece of luck befall me: a long\nand blessed evening with Emerson, in a way I couldn't have wish'd better\nor different. For nearly two hours he has been placidly sitting where\nI could see his face in the best light, near me. Mrs. S.'s back-parlor\nwell fill'd with people, neighbors, many fresh and charming faces,\nwomen, mostly young, but some old. My friend A. B. Alcott and his\ndaughter Louisa were there early. A good deal of talk, the subject Henry\nThoreau--some new glints of his life and fortunes, with letters to and\nfrom him--one of the best by Margaret Fuller, others by Horace Greeley,\nChanning, &c.--one from Thoreau himself, most quaint and interesting.\n(No doubt I seem'd very stupid to the roomful of company, taking hardly\nany part in the conversation; but I had \"my own pail to milk in,\" as the\nSwiss proverb puts it.) My seat and the relative arrangement were such\nthat, without being rude, or anything of the kind, I could just look\nsquarely at E., which I did a good part of the two hours. On entering,\nhe had spoken very briefly and politely to several of the company,\nthen settled himself in his chair, a trifle push'd back, and, though a\nlistener and apparently an alert one, remain'd silent through the whole\ntalk and discussion. A lady friend quietly took a seat next him, to\ngive special attention. A good color in his face, eyes clear, with the\nwell-known expression of sweetness, and the old clear-peering aspect\nquite the same.\n\n_Next Day_.--Several hours at E.'s house, and dinner there. An\nold familiar house, (he has been in it thirty-five years,) with\nsurroundings, furnishment, roominess, and plain elegance and fullness,\nsignifying democratic ease, sufficient opulence, and an admirable\nold-fashioned simplicity--modern luxury, with its mere sumptuousness and\naffectation, either touch'd lightly upon or ignored altogether. Dinner\nthe same. Of course the best of the occasion (Sunday, September 18,\n'81) was the sight of E. himself. As just said, a healthy color in the\ncheeks, and good light in the eyes, cheery expression, and just the\namount of talking that best suited, namely, a word or short phrase only\nwhere needed, and almost always with a smile. Besides Emerson himself,\nMrs. E., with their daughter Ellen, the son Edward and his wife, with\nmy friend F. S. and Mrs. S., and others, relatives and intimates. Mrs.\nEmerson, resuming the subject of the evening before, (I sat next to\nher,) gave me further and fuller information about Thoreau, who, years\nago, during Mr. E.'s absence in Europe, had lived for some time in the\nfamily, by invitation.\n\n\nOTHER CONCORD NOTATIONS\n\nThough the evening at Mr. and Mrs. Sanborn's, and the memorable family\ndinner at Mr. and Mrs. Emerson's, have most pleasantly and permanently\nfill'd my memory, I must not slight other notations of Concord. I went\nto the old Manse, walk'd through the ancient garden, enter'd the rooms,\nnoted the quaintness, the unkempt grass and bushes, the little panes in\nthe windows, the low ceilings, the spicy smell, the creepers embowering\nthe light. Went to the Concord battle ground, which is close by, scann'd\nFrench's statue, \"the Minute Man,\" read Emerson's poetic inscription on\nthe base, linger'd a long while on the bridge, and stopp'd by the grave\nof the unnamed British soldiers buried there the day after the fight\nin April, '75. Then riding on, (thanks to my friend Miss M. and her\nspirited white ponies, she driving them,) a half hour at Hawthorne's and\nThoreau's graves. I got out and went up of course on foot, and stood a\nlong while and ponder'd. They lie close together in a pleasant wooded\nspot well up the cemetery hill, \"Sleepy Hollow.\" The flat surface of the\nfirst was densely cover'd by myrtle, with a border of arbor-vitae,\nand the other had a brown headstone, moderately elaborate, with\ninscriptions. By Henry's side lies his brother John, of whom much\nwas expected, but he died young. Then to Walden pond, that beautiful\nembower'd sheet of water, and spent over an hour there. On the spot in\nthe woods where Thoreau had his solitary house is now quite a cairn of\nstones, to mark the place; I too carried one and deposited on the heap.\nAs we drove back, saw the \"School of Philosophy,\" but it was shut up,\nand I would not have it open'd for me. Near by stopp'd at the house\nof W.T. Harris, the Hegelian, who came out, and we had a pleasant chat\nwhile I sat in the wagon. I shall not soon forget those Concord drives,\nand especially that charming Sunday forenoon one with my friend Miss M.,\nand the white ponies.\n\n\nBOSTON COMMON--MORE OF EMERSON\n\n_Oct. 10-13._--I spend a good deal of time on the Common, these\ndelicious days and nights--every mid-day from 11.30 to about 1--and\nalmost every sunset another hour. I know all the big trees, especially\nthe old elms along Tremont and Beacon streets, and have come to a\nsociable silent understanding with most of them, in the sunlit air, (yet\ncrispy-cool enough,) as I saunter along the wide unpaved walks. Up\nand down this breadth by Beacon street, between these same old elms,\nI walk'd for two hours, of a bright sharp February mid-day twenty-one\nyears ago, with Emerson, then in his prime, keen, physically and\nmorally magnetic, arm'd at every point, and when he chose, wielding the\nemotional just as well as the intellectual. During those two hours\nhe was the talker and I the listener. It was an argument-statement,\nreconnoitring, review, attack, and pressing home, (like an army corps in\norder, artillery, cavalry, infantry,) of all that could be said against\nthat part (and a main part) in the construction of my poems, \"Children\nof Adam.\" More precious than gold to me that dissertion--it afforded\nme, ever after, this strange and paradoxical lesson; each point of E.'s\nstatement was unanswerable, no judge's charge ever more complete or\nconvincing, I could never hear the points better put--and then I felt\ndown in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all,\nand pursue my own way. \"What have you to say then to such things?\" said\nE., pausing in conclusion. \"Only that while I can't answer them at all,\nI feel more settled than ever to adhere to my own theory, and exemplify\nit,\" was my candid response. Whereupon we went and had a good dinner\nat the American House. And thenceforward I never waver'd or was touch'd\nwith qualms, (as I confess I had been two or three times before.)\n\n\nAN OSSIANIC NIGHT--DEAREST FRIENDS\n\n_Nov., '81_.--Again back in Camden. As I cross the Delaware in long trips\ntonight, between 9 and 11, the scene overhead is a peculiar one--swift\nsheets of flitting vapor-gauze, follow'd by dense clouds throwing an\ninky pall on everything. Then a spell of that transparent steel-gray\nblack sky I have noticed under similar circumstances, on which the moon\nwould beam for a few moments with calm lustre, throwing down a broad\ndazzle of highway on the waters; then the mists careering again. All\nsilently, yet driven as if by the furies they sweep along, sometimes\nquite thin, sometimes thicker--a real Ossianic night--amid the\nwhirl, absent or dead friends, the old, the past, somehow tenderly\nsuggested--while the Gael-strains chant themselves from the mists--\"Be\nthy soul blest, O Carril! in the midst of thy eddying winds. O that thou\nwouldst come to my hall when I am alone by night! And thou dost come,\nmy friend. I hear often thy light hand on my harp, when it hangs on the\ndistant wall, and the feeble sound touches my ear. Why dost thou not\nspeak to me in my grief, and tell me when I shall behold my friends? But\nthou passest away in thy murmuring blast; the wind whistles through the\ngray hairs of Ossian.\"\n\nBut most of all, those changes of moon and sheets of hurrying vapor and\nblack clouds, with the sense of rapid action in weird silence, recall\nthe far-back Erse belief that such above were the preparations for\nreceiving the wraiths of just-slain warriors--[\"We sat that night in\nSelma, round the strength of the shell. The wind was abroad in the oaks.\nThe spirit of the mountain roar'd. The blast came rustling through the\nhall, and gently touch'd my harp. The sound was mournful and low, like\nthe song of the tomb. Fingal heard it the first. The crowded sighs of\nhis bosom rose. Some of my heroes are low, said the gray-hair'd king\nof Morven. I hear the sound of death on the harp. Ossian, touch the\ntrembling string. Bid the sorrow rise, that their spirits may fly with\njoy to Morven's woody hills. I touch'd the harp before the king; the\nsound was mournful and low. Bend forward from your clouds, I said,\nghosts of my fathers! bend. Lay by the red terror of your course.\nReceive the falling chief; whether he comes from a distant land, or\nrises from the rolling sea. Let his robe of mist be near; his spear that\nis form'd of a cloud. Place a half-extinguish'd meteor by his side, in\nthe form of a hero's sword. And oh! let his countenance be lovely, that\nhis friends may delight in his presence. Bend from your clouds, I said,\nghosts of my fathers, bend. Such was my song in Selma, to the lightly\ntrembling harp.\"]\n\nHow or why I know not, just at the moment, but I too muse and think of\nmy best friends in their distant homes--of William O'Connor, of\nMaurice Bucke, of John Burroughs, and of Mrs. Gilchrist--friends of my\nsoul--stanchest friends of my other soul, my poems.\n\n\nONLY A NEW FERRY-BOAT\n\n_Jan. 12, '82_.--Such a show as the Delaware presented an hour before\nsundown yesterday evening, all along between Philadelphia and Camden,\nis worth weaving into an item. It was full tide, a fair breeze from the\nsouthwest, the water of a pale tawny color, and just enough motion to\nmake things frolicsome and lively. Add to these an approaching sunset\nof unusual splendor, a broad tumble of clouds, with much golden haze and\nprofusion of beaming shaft and dazzle. In the midst of all, in the clear\ndrab of the afternoon light, there steam'd up the river the large,\nnew boat, \"the Wenonah,\" as pretty an object as you could wish to see,\nlightly and swiftly skimming along, all trim and white, cover'd with\nflags, transparent red and blue, streaming out in the breeze. Only a new\nferry-boat, and yet in its fitness comparable with the prettiest product\nof Nature's cunning, and rivaling it. High up in the transparent ether\ngracefully balanced and circled four or five great sea hawks, while here\nbelow, amid the pomp and picturesqueness of sky and river, swam this\ncreation of artificial beauty and motion and power, in its way no less\nperfect.\n\n\nDEATH OF LONGFELLOW\n\n_Camden, April, '82_.--I have just return'd from an old forest haunt,\nwhere I love to go occasionally away from parlors, pavements, and the\nnewspapers and magazines--and where, of a clear forenoon, deep in the\nshade of pines and cedars and a tangle of old laurel-trees and vines,\nthe news of Longfellow's death first reach'd me. For want of anything\nbetter, let me lightly twine a sprig of the sweet ground-ivy trailing so\nplentifully through the dead leaves at my feet, with reflections of that\nhalf hour alone, there in the silence, and lay it as my contribution on\nthe dead bard's grave.\n\nLongfellow in his voluminous works seems to me not only to be eminent\nin the style and forms of poetical expression that mark the present age,\n(an idiosyncrasy, almost a sickness, of verbal melody,) but to bring\nwhat is always dearest as poetry to the general human heart and taste,\nand probably must be so in the nature of things. He is certainly the\nsort of bard and counteractant most needed for our materialistic,\nself-assertive, money-worshipping, Anglo-Saxon races, and especially for\nthe present age in America--an age tyrannically regulated with reference\nto the manufacturer, the merchant, the financier, the politician and\nthe day workman--for whom and among whom he comes as the poet of melody,\ncourtesy, deference--poet of the mellow twilight of the past in\nItaly, Germany, Spain, and in Northern Europe--poet of all sympathetic\ngentleness--and universal poet of women and young people. I should have\nto think long if I were ask'd to name the man who has done more, and in\nmore valuable directions, for America.\n\nI doubt if there ever was before such a fine intuitive judge and\nselecter of poems. His translations of many German and Scandinavian\npieces are said to be better than the vernaculars. He does not urge or\nlash. His influence is like good drink or air. He is not tepid either,\nbut always vital, with flavor, motion, grace. He strikes a splendid\naverage, and does not sing exceptional passions, or humanity's jagged\nescapades. He is not revolutionary, brings nothing offensive or new,\ndoes not deal hard blows. On the contrary, his songs soothe and heal, or\nif they excite, it is a healthy and agreeable excitement. His very\nanger is gentle, is at second hand, (as in the \"Quadroon Girl\" and the\n\"Witnesses.\")\n\nThere is no undue element of pensiveness in Longfellow's strains. Even\nin the early translation, the Manrique, the movement is as of strong\nand steady wind or tide, holding up and buoying. Death is not avoided\nthrough his many themes, but there is something almost winning in his\noriginal verses and renderings on that dread subject--as, closing \"the\nHappiest Land\" dispute,\n\n    And then the landlord's daughter\n      Up to heaven rais'd her hand,\n    And said, \"Ye may no more contend,\n      There lies the happiest land.\"\n\nTo the ungracious complaint-charge of his want of racy nativity and\nspecial originality, I shall only say that America and the world may\nwell be reverently thankful--can never be thankful enough--for any such\nsinging-bird vouchsafed out of the centuries, without asking that the\nnotes be different from those of other songsters; adding what I have\nheard Longfellow himself say, that ere the New World can be worthily\noriginal, and announce herself and her own heroes, she must be well\nsaturated with the originality of others, and respectfully consider the\nheroes that lived before Agamemnon.\n\n\nSTARTING NEWSPAPERS\n\n_Reminiscences (From the \"Camden Courier\")_. As I sat taking my evening\nsail across the Delaware in the staunch ferry-boat \"Beverly,\" a night or\ntwo ago, I was join'd by two young reporter friends. \"I have a message\nfor you,\" said one of them; \"the C. folks told me to say they would like\na piece sign'd by your name, to go in their first number. Can you do\nit for them?\" \"I guess so,\" said I; \"what might it be about?\" \"Well,\nanything on newspapers, or perhaps what you've done yourself, starting\nthem.\" And off the boys went, for we had reach'd the Philadelphia side.\nThe hour was fine and mild, the bright half-moon shining; Venus, with\nexcess of splendor, just setting in the west, and the great Scorpion\nrearing its length more than half up in the southeast. As I cross'd\nleisurely for an hour in the pleasant night-scene, my young friend's\nwords brought up quite a string of reminiscences.\n\nI commenced when I was but a boy of eleven or twelve writing sentimental\nbits for the old \"Long Island Patriot,\" in Brooklyn; this was about\n1832. Soon after, I had a piece or two in George P. Morris's then\ncelebrated and fashionable \"Mirror,\" of New York city. I remember\nwith what half-suppress'd excitement I used to watch for the big, fat,\nred-faced, slow-moving, very old English carrier who distributed the\n\"Mirror\" in Brooklyn; and when I got one, opening and cutting the leaves\nwith trembling fingers. How it made my heart double-beat to see _my\npiece_ on the pretty white paper, in nice type.\n\nMy first real venture was the \"Long Islander,\" in my own beautiful\ntown of Huntington, in 1839. I was about twenty years old. I had been\nteaching country school for two or three years in various parts of\nSuffolk and Queens counties, but liked printing; had been at it while\na lad, learn'd the trade of compositor, and was encouraged to start a\npaper in the region where I was born. I went to New York, bought a press\nand types, hired some little help, but did most of the work myself,\nincluding the press-work. Everything seem'd turning out well; (only\nmy own restlessness prevented me gradually establishing a permanent\nproperty there.) I bought a good horse, and every week went all round\nthe country serving my papers, devoting one day and night to it. I never\nhad happier jaunts--going over to south side, to Babylon, down the south\nroad, across to Smithtown and Comac, and back home. The experiences of\nthose jaunts, the dear old-fashion'd farmers and their wives, the stops\nby the hay-fields, the hospitality, nice dinners, occasional evenings,\nthe girls, the rides through the brush, come up in my memory to this\nday.\n\nI next went to the \"Aurora\" daily in New York city--a sort of free\nlance. Also wrote regularly for the \"Tattler,\" an evening paper. With\nthese and a little outside work I was occupied off and on, until I\nwent to edit the \"Brooklyn Eagle,\" where for two years I had one of the\npleasantest sits of my life--a good owner, good pay, and easy work and\nhours. The troubles in the Democratic party broke forth about those\ntimes (1848-'49) and I split off with the radicals, which led to rows\nwith the boss and \"the party,\" and I lost my place.\n\nBeing now out of a job, I was offer'd impromptu, (it happen'd between\nthe acts one night in the lobby of the old Broadway theatre near Pearl\nstreet, New York city,) a good chance to go down to New Orleans on the\nstaff of the \"Crescent,\" a daily to be started there with plenty of\ncapital behind it. One of the owners, who was north buying material,\nmet me walking in the lobby, and though that was our first acquaintance,\nafter fifteen minutes' talk (and a drink) we made a formal bargain, and\nhe paid me two hundred dollars down to bind the contract and bear my\nexpenses to New Orleans. I started two days afterwards; had a good\nleisurely time, as the paper wasn't to be out in three weeks. I enjoy'd\nmy journey and Louisiana life much. Returning to Brooklyn a year or two\nafterward I started the \"Freeman,\" first as a weekly, then daily. Pretty\nsoon the secession war broke out, and I, too, got drawn in the current\nsouthward, and spent the following three years there, (as memorandized\npreceding.)\n\nBesides starting them as aforementioned, I have had to do, one time or\nanother, during my life, with a long list of papers, at divers places,\nsometimes under queer circumstances. During the war, the hospitals at\nWashington, among other means of amusement, printed a little sheet among\nthemselves, surrounded by wounds and death, the \"Armory Square Gazette,\"\nto which I contributed. The same long afterward, casually, to a paper--I\nthink it was call'd the \"Jimplecute\"--out in Colorado where I stopp'd at\nthe time. When I was in Quebec province, in Canada, in 1880, I went into\nthe queerest little old French printing-office near Tadousac. It was far\nmore primitive and ancient than my Camden friend William Kurtz's place\nup on Federal street. I remember, as a youngster, several characteristic\nold printers of a kind hard to be seen these days.\n\n\nTHE GREAT UNREST OF WHICH WE ARE PART\n\nMy thoughts went floating on vast and mystic currents as I sat to-day in\nsolitude and half-shade by the creek--returning mainly to two principal\ncentres. One of my cherish'd themes for a never-achiev'd poem has been\nthe two impetuses of man and the universe--in the latter, creation's\nincessant unrest,[19] exfoliation, (Darwin's evolution, I suppose.)\nIndeed, what is Nature but change, in all its visible, and still\nmore its invisible processes? Or what is humanity in its faith, love,\nheroism, poetry, even morals, but _emotion_?\n\n\nNote:\n\n[19] \"Fifty thousand years ago the constellation of the Great Bear or\nDipper was a starry cross; a hundred thousand years hence the imaginary\nDipper will be upside down, and the stars which form the bowl and handle\nwill have changed places. The misty nebulae are moving, and besides\nare whirling around in great spirals, some one way, some another. Every\nmolecule of matter in the whole universe is swinging to and fro; every\nparticle of ether which fills space is in jelly-like vibration. Light\nis one kind of motion, heat another, electricity another, magnetism\nanother, sound another. Every human sense is the result of motion; every\nperception, every thought is but motion of the molecules of the brain\ntranslated by that incomprehensible thing we call mind. The processes\nof growth, of existence, of decay, whether in worlds, or in the minutest\norganisms, are but motion.\"\n\n\nBY EMERSON'S GRAVE\n\n_May 6, '82._--We stand by Emerson's new-made grave without\nsadness--indeed a solemn joy and faith, almost hauteur--our soul-benison\nno mere\n\n    \"Warrior, rest, thy task is done,\"\n\nfor one beyond the warriors of the world lies surely symboll'd here.\nA just man, poised on himself, all-loving, all-inclosing, and sane and\nclear as the sun. Nor does it seem so much Emerson himself we are here\nto honor--it is conscience, simplicity, culture, humanity's attributes\nat their best, yet applicable if need be to average affairs, and\neligible to all. So used are we to suppose a heroic death can only\ncome from out of battle or storm, or mighty personal contest, or amid\ndramatic incidents or danger, (have we not been taught so for ages by\nall the plays and poems?) that few even of those who most sympathizingly\nmourn Emerson's late departure will fully appreciate the ripen'd\ngrandeur of that event, with its play of calm and fitness, like evening\nlight on the sea.\n\nHow I shall henceforth dwell on the blessed hours when, not long since,\nI saw that benignant face, the clear eyes, the silently smiling mouth,\nthe form yet upright in its great age--to the very last, with so much\nspring and cheeriness, and such an absence of decrepitude, that even the\nterm _venerable_ hardly seem'd fitting.\n\nPerhaps the life now rounded and completed in its mortal development,\nand which nothing can change or harm more, has its most illustrious\nhalo, not in its splendid intellectual or esthetic products, but as\nforming in its entirety one of the few (alas! how few!) perfect and\nflawless excuses for being, of the entire literary class.\n\nWe can say, as Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, It is not we who come to\nconsecrate the dead--we reverently come to receive, if so it may be,\nsome consecration to ourselves and daily work from him.\n\n\nAT PRESENT WRITING--PERSONAL\n\n_A letter to a German friend--extract_\n\n_May 31, '82._--\"From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis\nthat first affected me nearly ten years ago, has since remain'd, with\nvarying course--seems to have settled quietly down, and will probably\ncontinue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk far; but my spirits\nare first-rate. I go around in public almost every day--now and then\ntake long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles--live largely\nin the open air--am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)--keep up my activity\nand interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day.\nAbout two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality\nI ever had remains entirely unaffected; though physically I am a\nhalf-paralytic, and likely to be so, long as I live. But the principal\nobject of my life seems to have been accomplish'd--I have the most\ndevoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate relatives--and of\nenemies I really make no account.\"\n\n\nAFTER TRYING A CERTAIN BOOK\n\nI tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on \"the\nTheory of Poetry,\" received by mail this morning from England--but gave\nit up at last for a bad job. Here are some capricious pencillings that\nfollow'd, as I find them in my notes:\n\nIn youth and maturity Poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of\nday; but as the soul more and more takes precedence, (the sensuous still\nincluded,) the Dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere. I too have sought,\nand ever seek, the brilliant sun, and make my songs according. But as I\ngrow old, the half-lights of evening are far more to me.\n\nThe play of Imagination, with the sensuous objects of Nature for symbols\nand Faith--with Love and Pride as the unseen impetus and moving-power of\nall, make up the curious chess-game of a poem.\n\nCommon teachers or critics are always asking \"What does it mean?\"\nSymphony of fine musician, or sunset, or sea-waves rolling up the\nbeach--what do they mean? Undoubtedly in the most subtle-elusive sense\nthey mean something--as love does, and religion does, and the best\npoem;--but who shall fathom and define those meanings? (I do not intend\nthis as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapades--but to justify the\nsoul's frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part,\nor to calculation.)\n\nAt its best, poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in\nthe dusk, from speakers far or hid, of which we get only a few broken\nmurmurs. What is not gather'd is far more--perhaps the main thing.\n\nGrandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free removes, as we\nsometimes look for stars at night, not by gazing directly toward them,\nbut off one side.\n\n(_To a poetic student and friend._)--I only seek to put you in rapport.\nYour own brain, heart, evolution, must not only understand the matter,\nbut largely supply it.\n\n\nFINAL CONFESSIONS--LITERARY TESTS\n\nSo draw near their end these garrulous notes. There have doubtless\noccurr'd some repetitions, technical errors in the consecutiveness of\ndates, in the minutiae of botanical, astronomical, &c., exactness,\nand perhaps elsewhere;--for in gathering up, writing, peremptorily\ndispatching copy, this hot weather, (last of July and through August,\n'82,) and delaying not the printers, I have had to hurry along, no time\nto spare. But in the deepest veracity of all--in reflections of objects,\nscenes, Nature's outpourings, to my senses and receptivity, as they\nseem'd to me--in the work of giving those who care for it, some\nauthentic glints, specimen-days of my life--and in the _bona fide_\nspirit and relations, from author to reader, on all the subjects\ndesign'd, and as far as they go, I feel to make unmitigated claims.\n\nThe synopsis of my early life, Long Island, New York city, and so forth,\nand the diary-jottings in the Secession war, tell their own story. My\nplan in starting what constitutes most of the middle of the book, was\noriginally for hints and data of a Nature-poem that should carry one's\nexperiences a few hours, commencing at noon-flush, and so through\nthe after-part of the day--I suppose led to such idea by my own\nlife-afternoon now arrived. But I soon found I could move at more ease,\nby giving the narrative at first hand. (Then there is a humiliating\nlesson one learns, in serene hours, of a fine day or night. Nature seems\nto look on all fixed-up poetry and art as something almost impertinent.)\n\nThus I went on, years following, various seasons and areas, spinning\nforth my thought beneath the night and stars, (or as I was confined to\nmy room by half-sickness,) or at midday looking out upon the sea, or far\nnorth steaming over the Saguenay's black breast, jotting all down in the\nloosest sort of chronological order, and here printing from my\nimpromptu notes, hardly even the seasons group'd together, or anything\ncorrected--so afraid of dropping what smack of outdoors or sun or\nstarlight might cling to the lines, I dared not try to meddle with or\nsmooth them. Every now and then, (not often, but for a foil,) I carried\na book in my pocket--or perhaps tore out from some broken or cheap\nedition a bunch of loose leaves; most always had something of the sort\nready, but only took it out when the mood demanded. In that way, utterly\nout of reach of literary conventions, I re-read many authors.\n\nI cannot divest my appetite of literature, yet I find myself eventually\ntrying it all by Nature--_first premises_ many call it, but really the\ncrowning results of all, laws, tallies and proofs. (Has it never occur'd\nto any one how the last deciding tests applicable to a book are\nentirely outside of technical and grammatical ones, and that any truly\nfirst-class production has little or nothing to do with the rules and\ncalibres of ordinary critics? or the bloodless chalk of Allibone's\nDictionary? I have fancied the ocean and the daylight, the mountain\nand the forest, putting their spirit in a judgment on our books. I have\nfancied some disembodied human soul giving its verdict.)\n\n\nNATURE AND DEMOCRACY--MORALITY\n\nDemocracy most of all affiliates with the open air, is sunny and hardy\nand sane only with Nature--just as much as Art is. Something is required\nto temper both--to check them, restrain them from excess, morbidity. I\nhave wanted, before departure, to bear special testimony to a very old\nlesson and requisite. American Democracy, in its myriad personalities,\nin factories, work-shops, stores, offices--through the dense streets and\nhouses of cities, and all their manifold sophisticated life--must either\nbe fibred, vitalized, by regular contact with out-door light and air and\ngrowths, farm-scenes, animals, fields, trees, birds, sun-warmth and free\nskies, or it will certainly dwindle and pale. We cannot have grand races\nof mechanics, work people, and commonalty, (the only specific purpose\nof America,) on any less terms. I conceive of no flourishing and heroic\nelements of Democracy in the United States, or of Democracy maintaining\nitself at all, without the Nature-element forming a main part--to be\nits health-element and beauty-element--to really underlie the whole\npolitics, sanity, religion and art of the New World.\n\nFinally, the morality: \"Virtue,\" said Marcus Aurelius, \"what is it,\nonly a living and enthusiastic sympathy with Nature?\" Perhaps indeed the\nefforts of the true poets, founders, religions, literatures, all ages,\nhave been, and ever will be, our time and times to come, essentially the\nsame--to bring people back from their persistent strayings and sickly\nabstractions, to the costless average, divine, original concrete.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOLLECT\n\n\n\n\nONE OR TWO INDEX ITEMS\n\n\nThough the ensuing COLLECT and preceding SPECIMEN DAYS are both largely\nfrom memoranda already existing, the hurried peremptory needs of copy\nfor the printers, already referr'd to--(the musicians' story of a\ncomposer up in a garret rushing the middle body and last of his score\ntogether, while the fiddlers are playing the first parts down in the\nconcert-room)--of this haste, while quite willing to get the consequent\nstimulus of life and motion, I am sure there must have resulted sundry\ntechnical errors. If any are too glaring they will be corrected in a\nfuture edition.\n\nA special word about PIECES IN EARLY YOUTH at the end. On jaunts over\nLong Island, as boy and young fellow, nearly half a century ago, I heard\nof, or came across in my own experience, characters, true occurrences,\nincidents, which I tried my 'prentice hand at recording--(I was\nthen quite an \"abolitionist\" and advocate of the \"temperance\" and\n\"anti-capital-punishment\" causes)--and publish'd during occasional\nvisits to New York city. A majority of the sketches appear'd first in\nthe \"Democratic Review,\" others in the \"Columbian Magazine,\" or the\n\"American Review,\" of that period. My serious wish were to have all\nthose crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp'd in oblivion--but to avoid\nthe annoyance of their surreptitious issue, (as lately announced, from\noutsiders,) I have, with some qualms, tack'd them on here. _A Dough-Face\nSong_ came out first in the \"Evening Post\"--_Blood-Money_, and _Wounded\nin the House of Friends_, in the \"Tribune.\"\n\n_Poetry To-day in America_, &c., first appear'd (under the name of \"_The\nPoetry of the Future_,\") in \"The North American Review\" for February,\n1881. _A Memorandum at a Venture_, in same periodical, some time\nafterward.\n\nSeveral of the convalescent out-door scenes and literary items,\npreceding, originally appear'd in the fortnightly \"Critic,\" of New York.\n\n\n\n\nDEMOCRATIC VISTAS\n\n\nAs the greatest lessons of Nature through the universe are perhaps the\nlessons of variety and freedom, the same present the greatest lessons\nalso in New World politics and progress. If a man were ask'd, for\ninstance, the distinctive points contrasting modern European and\nAmerican political and other life with the old Asiatic cultus, as\nlingering-bequeath'd yet in China and Turkey, he might find the amount\nof them in John Stuart Mill's profound essay on Liberty in the future,\nwhere he demands two main constituents, or sub-strata, for a truly grand\nnationality--1st, a large variety of character--and 2d, full play\nfor human nature to expand itself in numberless and even conflicting\ndirections--(seems to be for general humanity much like the influences\nthat make up, in their limitless field, that perennial health-action of\nthe air we call the weather--an infinite number of currents and forces,\nand contributions, and temperatures, and cross-purposes, whose ceaseless\nplay of counterpart upon counterpart brings constant restoration and\nvitality.) With this thought--and not for itself alone, but all it\nnecessitates, and draws after it--let me begin my speculations.\n\nAmerica, filling the present with greatest deeds and problems,\ncheerfully accepting the past, including feudalism, (as, indeed, the\npresent is but the legitimate birth of the past, including feudalism,)\ncounts, as I reckon, for her justification and success, (for who, as\nyet, dare claim success?) almost entirely on the future. Nor is that\nhope unwarranted. To-day, ahead, though dimly yet, we see, in vistas, a\ncopious, sane, gigantic offspring. For our New World I consider far less\nimportant for what it has done, or what it is, than for results to come.\nSole among nationalities, these States have assumed the task to put in\nforms of lasting power and practicality, on areas of amplitude rivaling\nthe operations of the physical kosmos, the moral political speculations\nof ages, long, long deferr'd, the democratic republican principle, and\nthe theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards, and\nself-reliance. Who else, indeed, except the United States, in history,\nso far, have accepted in unwitting faith, and, as we now see, stand, act\nupon, and go security for, these things? But preluding no longer, let\nme strike the key-note of the following strain. First premising that,\nthough the passages of it have been written at widely different\ntimes, (it is, in fact, a collection of memoranda, perhaps for future\ndesigners, comprehenders,) and though it may be open to the charge of\none part contradicting another--for there are opposite sides to the\ngreat question of democracy, as to every great question--I feel the\nparts harmoniously blended in my own realization and convictions, and\npresent them to be read only in such oneness, each page and each claim\nand assertion modified and temper'd by the others. Bear in mind, too,\nthat they are not the result of studying up in political economy, but of\nthe ordinary sense, observing, wandering among men, these States, these\nstirring years of war and peace. I will not gloss over the appaling\ndangers of universal suffrage in the United States. In fact, it is to\nadmit and face these dangers I am writing. To him or her within whose\nthought rages the battle, advancing, retreating, between democracy's\nconvictions, aspirations, and the people's crudeness, vice, caprices, I\nmainly write this essay. I shall use the words America and democracy as\nconvertible terms. Not an ordinary one is the issue. The United States\nare destined either to surmount the gorgeous history of feudalism, or\nelse prove the most tremendous failure of time. Not the least doubtful\nam I on any prospects of their material success. The triumphant future\nof their business, geographic and productive departments, on larger\nscales and in more varieties than ever, is certain. In those respects\nthe republic must soon (if she does not already) outstrip all examples\nhitherto afforded, and dominate the world.[20]\n\nAdmitting all this, with the priceless value of our political\ninstitutions, general suffrage, (and fully acknowledging the latest,\nwidest opening of the doors,) I say that, far deeper than these, what\nfinally and only is to make of our western world a nationality superior\nto any hither known, and out-topping the past, must be vigorous,\nyet unsuspected Literatures, perfect personalities and sociologies,\noriginal, transcendental, and expressing (what, in highest sense, are\nnot yet express'd at all,) democracy and the modern. With these, and\nout of these, I promulge new races of Teachers, and of perfect Women,\nindispensable to endow the birth-stock of a New World. For feudalism,\ncaste, the ecclesiastic traditions, though palpably retreating from\npolitical institutions, still hold essentially, by their spirit, even in\nthis country, entire possession of the more important fields, indeed the\nvery subsoil, of education, and of social standards and literature.\n\nI say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil, until it\nfounds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art, poems, schools,\ntheology, displacing all that exists, or that has been produced anywhere\nin the past, under opposite influences. It is curious to me that\nwhile so many voices, pens, minds, in the press, lecture-rooms, in our\nCongress, &c., are discussing intellectual topics, pecuniary dangers,\nlegislative problems, the suffrage, tariff and labor questions, and the\nvarious business and benevolent needs of America, with propositions,\nremedies, often worth deep attention, there is one need, a hiatus the\nprofoundest, that no eye seems to perceive, no voice to state. Our\nfundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest, amplest\nreference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class,\nand the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literatuses, far\ndifferent, far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern,\nfit to cope with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of\nAmerican mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of\nlife, giving it decision, affecting politics far more than the popular\nsuperficial suffrage, with results inside and underneath the elections\nof Presidents or Congresses--radiating, begetting appropriate teachers,\nschools, manners, and, as its grandest result, accomplishing, (what\nneither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto\naccomplish'd, and without which this nation will no more stand,\npermanently, soundly, than a house will stand without a substratum,) a\nreligious and moral character beneath the political and productive\nand intellectual bases of the States. For know you not, dear, earnest\nreader, that the people of our land may all read and write, and may\nall possess the right to vote--and yet the main things may be entirely\nlacking?--(and this to suggest them.)\n\nView'd, to-day, from a point of view sufficiently over-arching,\nthe problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and\nreligious, and is to be finally met and treated by literature. The\npriest departs, the divine literatus comes. Never was anything more\nwanted than, to-day, and here in the States, the poet of the modern is\nwanted, or the great literatus of the modern. At all times, perhaps, the\ncentral point in any nation, and that whence it is itself really sway'd\nthe most, and whence it sways others, is its national literature,\nespecially its archetypal poems. Above all previous lands, a great\noriginal literature is surely to become the justification and reliance,\n(in some respects the sole reliance,) of American democracy.\n\nFew are aware how the great literature penetrates all, gives hue to\nall, shapes aggregates and individuals, and, after subtle ways, with\nirresistible power, constructs, sustains, demolishes at will. Why tower,\nin reminiscence, above all the nations of the earth, two special lands,\npetty in themselves, yet inexpressibly gigantic, beautiful, columnar?\nImmortal Judah lives, and Greece immortal lives, in a couple of poems.\n\nNearer than this. It is not generally realized, but it is true, as\nthe genius of Greece, and all the sociology, personality, politics\nand religion of those wonderful states, resided in their literature\nor esthetics, that what was afterwards the main support of European\nchivalry, the feudal, ecclesiastical, dynastic world over there--forming\nits osseous structure, holding it together for hundreds, thousands\nof years, preserving its flesh and bloom, giving it form, decision,\nrounding it out, and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious\nblood, breed, belief, and intuitions of men, that it still prevails\npowerful to this day, in defiance of the mighty changes of time--was its\nliterature, permeating to the very marrow, especially that major part,\nits enchanting songs, ballads, and poems.[21]\n\nTo the ostent of the senses and eyes, I know, the influences which\nstamp the world's history are wars, uprisings or downfalls of dynasties,\nchangeful movements of trade, important inventions, navigation, military\nor civil governments, advent of powerful personalities, conquerors,\netc.. These of course play their part; yet, it may be, a single new\nthought, imagination, abstract principle, even literary style, fit for\nthe time, put in shape by some great literatus, and projected among\nmankind, may duly cause changes, growths, removals, greater than the\nlongest and bloodiest war, or the most stupendous merely political,\ndynastic, or commercial overturn.\n\nIn short, as, though it may not be realized, it is strictly true, that\na few first-class poets, philosophs, and authors, have substantially\nsettled and given status to the entire religion, education, law,\nsociology, &c., of the hitherto civilized world, by tinging and often\ncreating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen, such also\nmust stamp, and more than ever stamp, the interior and real democratic\nconstruction of this American continent, to-day, and days to come.\nRemember also this fact of difference, that, while through the antique\nand through the mediaeval ages, highest thoughts and ideals realized\nthemselves, and their expression made its way by other arts, as much\nas, or even more than by, technical literature, (not open to the mass of\npersons, or even to the majority of eminent persons,) such literature in\nour day and for current purposes, is not only more eligible than all\nthe other arts put together, but has become the only general means of\nmorally influencing the world. Painting, sculpture, and the dramatic\ntheatre, it would seem, no longer play an indispensable or even\nimportant part in the workings and mediumship of intellect, utility, or\neven high esthetics. Architecture remains, doubtless with capacities,\nand a real future. Then music, the combiner, nothing more spiritual,\nnothing more sensuous, a god, yet completely human, advances, prevails,\nholds highest place; supplying in certain wants and quarters what\nnothing else could supply. Yet in the civilization of to-day it is\nundeniable that, over all the arts, literature dominates, serves beyond\nall--shapes the character of church and school--or, at any rate, is\ncapable of doing so. Including the literature of science, its scope is\nindeed unparallel'd.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it were perhaps well to discriminate on\ncertain points. Literature tills its crops in many fields, and some\nmay flourish, while others lag. What I say in these Vistas has its main\nbearing on imaginative literature, especially poetry, the stock of all.\nIn the department of science, and the specialty of journalism, there\nappear, in these States, promises, perhaps fulfilments, of highest\nearnestness, reality, and life, These, of course, are modern. But in\nthe region of imaginative, spinal and essential attributes, something\nequivalent to creation is, for our age and lands, imperatively demanded.\nFor not only is it not enough that the new blood, new frame of\ndemocracy shall be vivified and held together merely by political means,\nsuperficial suffrage, legislation, &c., but it is clear to me that,\nunless it goes deeper, gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in\nmen's hearts, emotions and belief, as, in their days, feudalism or\necclesiasticism, and inaugurates its own perennial sources, welling from\nthe centre forever, its strength will be defective, its growth doubtful,\nand its main charm wanting. I suggest, therefore, the possibility,\nshould some two or three really original American poets, (perhaps\nartists or lecturers,) arise, mounting the horizon like planets, stars\nof the first magnitude, that, from their eminence, fusing contributions,\nraces, far localities, &c., together, they would give more compaction\nand more moral identity, (the quality to-day most needed,) to these\nStates, than all its Constitutions, legislative and judicial ties, and\nall its hitherto political, warlike, or materialistic experiences. As,\nfor instance, there could hardly happen anything that would more serve\nthe States, with all their variety of origins, their diverse climes,\ncities, standards, &c., than possessing an aggregate of heroes,\ncharacters, exploits, sufferings, prosperity or misfortune, glory or\ndisgrace, common to all, typical of all--no less, but even greater would\nit be to possess the aggregation of a cluster of mighty poets, artists,\nteachers, fit for us, national expressers, comprehending and effusing\nfor the men and women of the States, what is universal, native, common\nto all, inland and seaboard, northern and southern. The historians say\nof ancient Greece, with her ever-jealous autonomies, cities, and states,\nthat the only positive unity she ever own'd or receiv'd, was the sad\nunity of a common subjection, at the last, to foreign conquerors.\nSubjection, aggregation of that sort, is impossible to America; but\nthe fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors, and the lack of\na common skeleton, knitting all close, continually haunts me. Or, if it\ndoes not, nothing is plainer than the need, a long period to come, of\na fusion of the States into the only reliable identity, the moral\nand artistic one. For, I say, the true nationality of the States, the\ngenuine union, when we come to a moral crisis, is, and is to be, after\nall, neither the written law, nor, (as is generally supposed,) either\nself-interest, or common pecuniary or material objects--but the fervid\nand tremendous IDEA, melting everything else with resistless heat,\nand solving all lesser and definite distinctions in vast, indefinite,\nspiritual, emotional power.\n\nIt may be claim'd, (and I admit the weight of the claim,) that common\nand general worldly prosperity, and a populace well-to-do, and with all\nlife's material comforts, is the main thing, and is enough. It may be\nargued that our republic is, in performance, really enacting to-day the\ngrandest arts, poems, &c., by beating up the wilderness into fertile\nfarms, and in her railroads, ships, machinery, &c. And it may be ask'd,\nAre these not better, indeed, for America, than any utterances even of\ngreatest rhapsode, artist, or literatus?\n\nI too hail those achievements with pride and joy: then answer that\nthe soul of man will not with such only--nay, not with such at all--be\nfinally satisfied; but needs what, (standing on these and on all things,\nas the feet stand on the ground,) is address'd to the loftiest, to\nitself alone.\n\nOut of such considerations, such truths, arises for treatment in\nthese Vistas the important question of character, of an American\nstock-personality, with literatures and arts for outlets and\nreturn-expressions, and, of course, to correspond, within outlines\ncommon to all. To these, the main affair, the thinkers of the United\nStates, in general so acute, have either given feeblest attention, or\nhave remain'd, and remain, in a state of somnolence.\n\nFor my part, I would alarm and caution even the political and business\nreader, and to the utmost extent, against the prevailing delusion\nthat the establishment of free political institutions, and plentiful\nintellectual smartness, with general good order, physical plenty,\nindustry, &c., (desirable and precious advantages as they all are,) do,\nof themselves, determine and yield to our experiment of democracy the\nfruitage of success. With such advantages at present fully, or almost\nfully, possess'd--the Union just issued, victorious, from the struggle\nwith the only foes it need ever fear, (namely, those within itself,\nthe interior ones,) and with unprecedented materialistic\nadvancement--society, in these States, is canker'd, crude,\nsuperstitious, and rotten. Political, or law-made society is, and\nprivate, or voluntary society, is also. In any vigor, the element of\nthe moral conscience, the most important, the verteber to State or man,\nseems to me either entirely lacking, or seriously enfeebled or ungrown.\n\nI say we had best look our times and lands searchingly in the face, like\na physician diagnosing some deep disease. Never was there, perhaps,\nmore hollowness at heart than at present, and here in the United States.\nGenuine belief seems to have left us. The underlying principles of the\nStates are not honestly believ'd in, (for all this hectic glow, and\nthese melo-dramatic screamings,) nor is humanity itself believ'd in.\nWhat penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask? The\nspectacle is appaling. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout.\nThe men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful\nsuperciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the _litterateurs_\nis to find something to make fun of. A lot of churches, sects, &c., the\nmost dismal phantasms I know, usurp the name of religion. Conversation\nis a mass of badinage. From deceit in the spirit, the mother of all\nfalse deeds, the offspring is already incalculable. An acute and candid\nperson, in the revenue department in Washington, who is led by the\ncourse of his employment to regularly visit the cities, north, south\nand west, to investigate frauds, has talk'd much with me about his\ndiscoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is\nnot less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The official\nservices of America, national, state, and municipal, in all their\nbranches and departments, except the judiciary, are saturated in\ncorruption, bribery, falsehood, mal-administration; and the judiciary\nis tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as\nnon-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable life,\nflippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at\nall, only to kill time. In business, (this all-devouring modern word,\nbusiness,) the one sole object is, by any means, pecuniary gain. The\nmagician's serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents; and\nmoney-making is our magician's serpent, remaining today sole master of\nthe field. The best class we show, is but a mob of fashionably dress'd\nspeculators and vulgarians. True, indeed, behind this fantastic farce,\nenacted on the visible stage of society, solid things and stupendous\nlabors are to be discover'd, existing crudely and going on in the\nbackground, to advance and tell themselves in time. Yet the truths are\nnone the less terrible. I say that our New World democracy, however\ngreat a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in\nmaterialistic development, products, and in a certain highly-deceptive\nsuperficial popular intellectuality, is, so far, an almost complete\nfailure in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral,\nliterary, and esthetic results. In vain do we march with unprecedented\nstrides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's,\nbeyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annex'd Texas,\nCalifornia, Alaska, and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba. It\nis as if we were somehow being endow'd with a vast and more and more\nthoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.\n\nLet me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations,\nlocalities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition.\nAfter an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and\nBrooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendor, picturesqueness,\nand oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpass'd\nsituation, rivers and bay, sparkling sea-tides, costly and lofty new\nbuildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance\nof design, with the masses of gay color, the preponderance of white\nand blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets,\nBroadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even\nat night; the jobbers' houses, the rich shops, the wharves, the great\nCentral Park, and the Brooklyn Park of hills, (as I wander among\nthem this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)--the\nassemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades,\nevening amusements, or along the by-quarters--these, I say, and the like\nof these, completely satisfy my senses of power, fulness, motion, &c.,\nand give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic\nconscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always and\nmore and more, as I cross the East and North rivers, the ferries, or\nwith the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in Wall street,\nor the gold exchange, I realize, (if we must admit such partialisms,)\nthat not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open\nair, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests,\nseas--but in the artificial, the work of man too is equally great--in\nthis profusion of teeming humanity--in these ingenuities, streets,\ngoods, houses, ships--these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men,\ntheir complicated business genius, (not least among the geniuses,) and\nall this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.\n\nBut sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of\nthe general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real\nimportance, Personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask,\nAre there, indeed, _men_ here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are\nthere perfect women, to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there\na pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine\nyouths, and majestic old persons? Are there arts worthy freedom and a\nrich people? Is there a great moral and religious civilization--the\nonly justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes,\nusing the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara\nappears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations,\nphantoms, playing meaningless antics.\n\nConfess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room,\nofficial chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning,\ninfidelity--everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely\nripe--everywhere an abnormal libidinousness, unhealthy forms, male,\nfemale, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood,\nthe capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceas'd, shallow\nnotions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners,\n(considering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in\nthe world.[22]\n\nOf all this, and these lamentable conditions, to breathe into them\nthe breath recuperative of sane and heroic life, I say a new founded\nliterature, not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces, or pander\nto what is called taste--not only to amuse, pass away time, celebrate\nthe beautiful, the refined, the past, or exhibit technical, rhythmic,\nor grammatical dexterity--but a literature underlying life, religious,\nconsistent with science, handling the elements and forces with competent\npower, teaching and training men--and, as perhaps the most precious\nof its results, achieving the entire redemption of woman out of these\nincredible holds and webs of silliness, millinery, and every kind of\ndyspeptic depletion--and thus insuring to the States a strong and sweet\nFemale Race, a race of perfect Mothers--is what is needed.\n\nAnd now, in the full conception of these facts and points, and all that\nthey infer, pro and con--with yet unshaken faith in the elements of the\nAmerican masses, the composites, of both sexes, and even consider'd as\nindividuals--and ever recognizing in them the broadest bases of the\nbest literary and esthetic appreciation--I proceed with my speculations,\nVistas.\n\nFirst, let us see what we can make out of a brief, general, sentimental\nconsideration of political democracy, and whence it has arisen, with\nregard to some of its current features, as an aggregate, and as the\nbasic structure of our future literature and authorship. We shall, it is\ntrue, quickly and continually find the origin-idea of the singleness of\nman, individualism, asserting itself, and cropping forth, even from the\nopposite ideas. But the mass, or lump character, for imperative reasons,\nis to be ever carefully weigh'd, borne in mind, and provided for. Only\nfrom it, and from its proper regulation and potency, comes the other,\ncomes the chance of individualism. The two are contradictory, but our\ntask is to reconcile them.[23]\n\nThe political history of the past may be summ'd up as having grown out\nof what underlies the words, order, safety, caste, and especially out of\nthe need of some prompt deciding authority, and of cohesion at all cost.\nLeaping time, we come to the period within the memory of people\nnow living, when, as from some lair where they had slumber'd long,\naccumulating wrath, sprang up and are yet active, (1790, and on eyen to\nthe present, 1870,) those noisy eructations, destructive iconoclasms, a\nfierce sense of wrongs, amid which moves the form, well known in modern\nhistory, in the old world, stain'd with much blood, and mark'd by savage\nreactionary clamors and demands. These bear, mostly, as on one inclosing\npoint of need.\n\nFor after the rest is said--after the many time-honor'd and really true\nthings for subordination, experience, rights of property, &c., have\nbeen listen'd to and acquiesced in--after the valuable and well-settled\nstatement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn'd\nover and exhausted--it remains to bring forward and modify everything\nelse with the idea of that Something a man is, (last precious\nconsolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else, divine\nin his own right, and a woman in hers, sole and untouchable by any\ncanons of authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety,\nthe acts of legislatures, or even from what is called religion, modesty,\nor art. The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant\ndoings of our immediately preceding three centuries, and has been the\npolitical genesis and life of America. Advancing visibly, it still more\nadvances invisibly. Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of\nsociety, as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations\nof the world, we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself,\neven in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation, this image\nof completeness in separatism, of individual personal dignity, of a\nsingle person, either male or female, characterized in the main, not\nfrom extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the pride of himself or\nherself alone; and, as an eventual conclusion and summing up, (or else\nthe entire scheme of things is aimless, a cheat, a crash,) the simple\nidea that the last, best dependence is to be upon humanity itself, and\nits own inherent, normal, fullgrown qualities, without any superstitious\nsupport whatever. This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that\ndeepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate. For it\nis mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a\nstrong generalization, consolidation. As it is to give the best vitality\nand freedom to the rights of the States, (every bit as important as the\nright of nationality, the union,) that we insist on the identity of the\nUnion at all hazards.\n\nThe purpose of democracy--supplanting old belief in the necessary\nabsoluteness of establish'd dynastic rulership, temporal,\necclesiastical, and scholastic, as furnishing the only security against\nchaos, crime, and ignorance--is, through many transmigrations, and amid\nendless ridicules, arguments, and ostensible failures, to illustrate,\nat all hazards, this doctrine or theory that man, properly train'd in\nsanest, highest freedom, may and must become a law, and series of laws,\nunto himself, surrounding and providing for, not only his own personal\ncontrol, but all his relations to other individuals, and to the State;\nand that, while other theories, as in the past histories of nations,\nhave proved wise enough, and indispensable perhaps for their conditions,\n_this,_ as matters now stand in our civilized world, is the only scheme\nworth working from, as warranting results like those of Nature's laws,\nreliable, when once establish'd, to carry on themselves.\n\nThe argument of the matter is extensive, and, we admit, by no means all\non one side. What we shall offer will be far, far from sufficient. But\nwhile leaving unsaid much that should properly even prepare the way\nfor the treatment of this many-sided question of political liberty,\nequality, or republicanism--leaving the whole history and consideration\nof the feudal plan and its products, embodying humanity, its politics\nand civilization, through the retrospect of past time, (which plan\nand products, indeed, make up all of the past, and a large part of the\npresent)--leaving unanswer'd, at least by any specific and local answer,\nmany a well-wrought argument and instance, and many a conscientious\ndeclamatory cry and warning--as, very lately, from an eminent and\nvenerable person abroad[24]--things, problems, full of doubt, dread,\nsuspense, (not new to me, but old occupiers of many an anxious hour in\ncity's din, or night's silence,) we still may give a page or so, whose\ndrift is opportune. Time alone can finally answer these things. But as\na substitute in passing, let us, even if fragmentarily, throw forth a\nshort direct or indirect suggestion of the premises of that other plan,\nin the new spirit, under the new forms, started here in our America.\n\nAs to the political section of Democracy, which introduces and breaks\nground for further and vaster sections, few probably are the minds, even\nin these republican States, that fully comprehend the aptness of that\nphrase, \"THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE,\"\nwhich we inherit from the lips of Abraham Lincoln; a formula whose\nverbal shape is homely wit, but whose scope includes both the totality\nand all minutiae of the lesson.\n\nThe People! Like our huge earth itself, which, to ordinary scansion,\nis full of vulgar contradictions and offence, man, viewed in the lump,\ndispleases, and is a constant puzzle and affront to the merely educated\nclasses. The rare, cosmical, artist-mind, lit with the Infinite, alone\nconfronts his manifold and oceanic qualities--but taste, intelligence\nand culture, (so-called,) have been against the masses, and remain so.\nThere is plenty of glamour about the most damnable crimes and hoggish\nmeannesses, special and general, of the feudal and dynastic world\nover there, with its _personnel_ of lords and queens and courts, so\nwell-dress'd and so handsome. But the People are ungrammatical, untidy,\nand their sins gaunt and ill-bred.\n\nLiterature, strictly consider'd, has never recognized the People,\nand, whatever may be said, does not to-day. Speaking generally, the\ntendencies of literature, as hitherto pursued, have been to make mostly\ncritical and querulous men. It seems as if, so far, there were some\nnatural repugnance between a literary and professional life, and the\nrude rank spirit of the democracies. There is, in later literature, a\ntreatment of benevolence, a charity business, rife enough it is\ntrue; but I know nothing more rare, even in this country, than a fit\nscientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People--of their\nmeasureless wealth of latent power and capacity, their vast, artistic\ncontrasts of lights and shades--with, in America, their entire\nreliability in emergencies, and a certain breadth of historic grandeur,\nof peace or war, far surpassing all the vaunted samples of book-heroes,\nor any _haut ton_ coteries, in all the records of the world.\n\nThe movements of the late secession war, and their results, to any sense\nthat studies well and comprehends them, show that popular democracy,\nwhatever its faults and dangers, practically justifies itself beyond the\nproudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts. Probably no future\nage can know, but I well know, how the gist of this fiercest and most\nresolute of the world's war-like contentions resided exclusively in the\nunnamed, unknown rank and file; and how the brunt of its labor of death\nwas, to all essential purposes, volunteer'd. The People, of their own\nchoice, fighting, dying for their own idea, insolently attack'd by the\nsecession-slave-power, and its very existence imperil'd. Descending\nto detail, entering any of the armies, and mixing with the private\nsoldiers, we see and have seen august spectacles. We have seen the\nalacrity with which the American-born populace, the peaceablest and most\ngood-natured race in the world, and the most personally independent\nand intelligent, and the least fitted to submit to the irksomeness and\nexasperation of regimental discipline, sprang, at the first tap of the\ndrum, to arms--not for gain, nor even glory, nor to repel invasion--but\nfor an emblem, a mere abstraction--for the life, _the safety of the\nflag_. We have seen the unequal'd docility and obedience of these\nsoldiers. We have seen them tried long and long by hopelessness,\nmismanagement, and by defeat; have seen the incredible slaughter toward\nor through which the armies (as at first Fredericksburg, and afterward\nat the Wilderness,) still unhesitatingly obey'd orders to advance. We\nhave seen them in trench, or crouching behind breastwork, or tramping\nin deep mud, or amid pouring rain or thick-falling snow, or under forced\nmarches in hottest summer (as on the road to get to Gettysburg)--vast\nsuffocating swarms, divisions, corps, with every single man so grimed\nand black with sweat and dust, his own mother would not have known\nhim--his clothes all dirty, stain'd and torn, with sour, accumulated\nsweat for perfume--many a comrade, perhaps a brother, sun-struck,\nstaggering out, dying, by the roadside, of exhaustion--yet the great\nbulk bearing steadily on, cheery enough, hollow-bellied from hunger, but\nsinewy with unconquerable resolution.\n\nWe have seen this race proved by wholesale by drearier, yet more fearful\ntests--the wound, the amputation, the shatter'd face or limb, the\nslow hot fever, long impatient anchorage in bed, and all the forms of\nmaiming, operation and disease. Alas! America have we seen, though only\nin her early youth, already to hospital brought. There have we watch'd\nthese soldiers, many of them only boys in years--mark'd their decorum,\ntheir religious nature and fortitude, and their sweet affection.\nWholesale, truly. For at the front, and through the camps, in countless\ntents, stood the regimental, brigade and division hospitals; while\neverywhere amid the land, in or near cities, rose clusters of huge,\nwhite-wash'd, crowded, one-story wooden barracks; and there ruled agony\nwith bitter scourge, yet seldom brought a cry; and there stalk'd death\nby day and night along the narrow aisles between the rows of cots, or\nby the blankets on the ground, and touch'd lightly many a poor sufferer,\noften with blessed, welcome touch.\n\nI know not whether I shall be understood, but I realize that it is\nfinally from what I learn'd personally mixing in such scenes that I am\nnow penning these pages. One night in the gloomiest period of the war,\nin the Patent-office hospital in Washington city, as I stood by\nthe bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay, conscious of quick\napproaching death, yet perfectly calm, and with noble, spiritual manner,\nthe veteran surgeon, turning aside, said to me, that though he had\nwitness'd many, many deaths of soldiers, and had been a worker at Bull\nRun, Antietam, Fredericksburg, &c., he had not seen yet the first case\nof man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms\nor terror. My own observation fully bears out the remark.\n\nWhat have we here, if not, towering above all talk and argument,\nthe plentifully-supplied, last-needed proof of democracy, in its\npersonalities? Curiously enough, too, the proof on this point comes,\nI should say, every bit as much from the south, as from the north.\nAlthough I have spoken only of the latter, yet I deliberately include\nall. Grand, common stock! to me the accomplish'd and convincing growth,\nprophetic of the future; proof undeniable to sharpest sense, of perfect\nbeauty, tenderness and pluck, that never feudal lord, nor Greek, nor\nRoman breed, yet rival'd. Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of\nthe American races, north or south, to one who has been through the war\nin the great army hospitals.\n\nMeantime, general humanity, (for to that we return, as, for our\npurposes, what it really is, to bear in mind,) has always, in every\ndepartment, been full of perverse maleficence, and is so yet. In\ndowncast hours the soul thinks it always will be--but soon recovers\nfrom such sickly moods. I myself see clearly enough the crude, defective\nstreaks in all the strata of the common people; the specimens and vast\ncollections of the ignorant, the credulous, the unfit and uncouth, the\nincapable, and the very low and poor. The eminent person just mention'd\nsneeringly asks whether we expect to elevate and improve a nation's\npolitics by absorbing such morbid collections and qualities therein. The\npoint is a formidable one, and there will doubtless always be numbers of\nsolid and reflective citizens who will never get over it. Our answer\nis general, and is involved in the scope and letter of this essay.\nWe believe the ulterior object of political and all other government,\n(having, of course, provided for the police, the safety of life,\nproperty, and for the basic statute and common law, and their\nadministration, always first in order,) to be among the rest, not\nmerely to rule, to repress disorder, &c., but to develop, to open up to\ncultivation, to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly\noutcroppage, and of that aspiration for independence, and the pride and\nself-respect latent in all characters. (Or, if there be exceptions, we\ncannot, fixing our eyes on them alone, make theirs the rule for all.)\n\nI say the mission of government, henceforth, in civilized lands, is not\nrepression alone, and not Authority alone, not even of law, nor by that\nfavorite standard of the eminent writer, the rule of the best men, the\nborn heroes and captains of the race, (as if such ever, or one time out\nof a hundred, get into the big places, elective or dynastic)--but higher\nthan the highest arbitrary rule, to train communities through all their\ngrades, beginning with individuals and ending there again, to rule\nthemselves. What Christ appear'd for in the moral-spiritual field for\nhuman-kind, namely, that in respect to the absolute soul, there is\nin the possession of such by each single individual, something so\ntranscendent, so incapable of gradations, (like life,) that, to that\nextent, it places all beings on a common level, utterly regardless\nof the distinctions of intellect, virtue, station, or any height or\nlowliness whatever--is tallied in like manner, in this other field, by\ndemocracy's rule that men, the nation, as a common aggregate of living\nidentities, affording in each a separate and complete subject for\nfreedom, worldly thrift and happiness, and for a fair chance for growth,\nand for protection in citizenship, &c., must, to the political extent\nof the suffrage or vote, if no further, be placed, in each and in the\nwhole, on one broad, primary, universal, common platform.\n\nThe purpose is not altogether direct; perhaps it is more indirect. For\nit is not that democracy is of exhaustive account, in itself. Perhaps,\nindeed, it is, (like Nature,) of no account in itself. It is that, as\nwe see, it is the best, perhaps only, fit and full means, formulater,\ngeneral caller-forth, trainer, for the million, not for grand material\npersonalities only, but for immortal souls. To be a voter with the\nrest is not so much; and this, like every institute, will have its\nimperfections.\n\nBut to become an enfranchised man, and now, impediments removed,\nto stand and start without humiliation, and equal with the rest; to\ncommence, or have the road clear'd to commence, the grand experiment of\ndevelopment, whose end, (perhaps requiring several generations,) may\nbe the forming of a full-grown man or woman--that _is_ something. To\nballast the State is also secured, and in our times is to be secured, in\nno other way.\n\nWe do not, (at any rate I do not,) put it either on the ground that\nthe People, the masses, even the best of them, are, in their latent or\nexhibited qualities, essentially sensible and good--nor on the ground of\ntheir rights; but that good or bad, rights or no rights, the democratic\nformula is the only safe and preservative one for coming times. We endow\nthe masses with the suffrage for their own sake, no doubt; then, perhaps\nstill more, from another point of view, for community's sake. Leaving\nthe rest to the sentimentalists, we present freedom as sufficient in\nits scientific aspect, cold as ice, reasoning, deductive, clear and\npassionless as crystal.\n\nDemocracy too is law, and of the strictest, amplest kind. Many suppose,\n(and often in its own ranks the error,) that it means a throwing aside\nof law, and running riot. But, briefly, it is the superior law, not\nalone that of physical force, the body, which, adding to, it supersedes\nwith that of the spirit. Law is the unshakable order of the universe\nforever; and the law over all, and law of laws, is the law of\nsuccessions; that of the superior law, in time, gradually supplanting\nand overwhelming the inferior one. (While, for myself, I would\ncheerfully agree--first covenanting that the formative tendencies shall\nbe administer'd in favor, or at least not against it, and that this\nreservation be closely construed--that until the individual or community\nshow due signs, or be so minor and fractional as not to endanger\nthe State, the condition of authoritative tutelage may continue, and\nself-government must abide its time.) Nor is the esthetic point, always\nan important one, without fascination for highest aiming souls. The\ncommon ambition strains for elevations, to become some privileged\nexclusive. The master sees greatness and health in being part of the\nmass; nothing will do as well as common ground. Would you have in\nyourself the divine, vast, general law? Then merge yourself in it.\n\nAnd, topping democracy, this most alluring record, that it alone can\nbind, and ever seeks to bind, all nations, all men, of however various\nand distant lands, into a brotherhood, a family. It is the old, yet\never-modern dream of earth, out of her eldest and her youngest, her\nfond philosophers and poets. Not that half only, individualism, which\nisolates. There is another half, which is adhesiveness or love, that\nfuses, ties and aggregates, making the races comrades, and fraternizing\nall. Both are to be vitalized by religion, (sole worthiest elevator of\nman or State,) breathing into the proud, material tissues, the breath\nof life. For I say at the core of democracy, finally, is the religious\nelement. All the religions, old and new, are there. Nor may the scheme\nstep forth, clothed in resplendent beauty and command, till these,\nbearing the best, the latest fruit, the spiritual, shall fully appear.\n\nA portion of our pages we might indite with reference toward Europe,\nespecially the British part of it, more than our own land, perhaps not\nabsolutely needed for the home reader. But the whole question hangs\ntogether, and fastens and links all peoples. The liberalist of to-day\nhas this advantage over antique or mediaeval times, that his doctrine\nseeks not only to individualize but to universalize. The great word\nSolidarity has arisen. Of all dangers to a nation, as things exist in\nour day, there can be no greater one than having certain portions of\nthe people set off from the rest by a line drawn--they not privileged\nas others, but degraded, humiliated, made of no account. Much quackery\nteems, of course, even on democracy's side, yet does not really affect\nthe orbic quality of the matter. To work in, if we may so term it, and\njustify God, his divine aggregate, the People, (or, the veritable horn'd\nand sharp-tail'd Devil, _his_ aggregate, if there be who convulsively\ninsist upon it)--this, I say, is what democracy is for; and this is what\nour America means, and is doing--may I not say, has done? If not, she\nmeans nothing more, and does nothing more, than any other land. And as,\nby virtue of its kosmical, antiseptic power, Nature's stomach is fully\nstrong enough not only to digest the morbific matter always presented,\nnot to be turn'd aside, and perhaps, indeed, intuitively gravitating\nthither--but even to change such contributions into nutriment for\nhighest use and life--so American democracy's. That is the lesson we,\nthese days, send over to European lands by every western breeze.\n\nAnd, truly, whatever may be said in the way of abstract argument, for\nor against the theory of a wider democratizing of institutions in any\ncivilized country, much trouble might well be saved to all European\nlands by recognizing this palpable fact, (for a palpable fact it is,)\nthat some form of such democratizing is about the only resource now\nleft. _That_, or chronic dissatisfaction continued, mutterings which\ngrow annually louder and louder, till, in due course, and pretty swiftly\nin most cases, the inevitable crisis, crash, dynastic ruin. Anything\nworthy to be call'd statesmanship in the Old World, I should say, among\nthe advanced students, adepts, or men of any brains, does not debate\nto-day whether to hold on, attempting to lean back and monarchize, or\nto look forward and democratize--but _how_, and in what degree and part,\nmost prudently to democratize.\n\nThe eager and often inconsiderate appeals of reformers and\nrevolutionists are indispensable, to counterbalance the inertness and\nfossilism making so large a part of human institutions. The latter will\nalways take care of themselves--the danger being that they rapidly tend\nto ossify us. The former is to be treated with indulgence, and even with\nrespect. As circulation to air, so is agitation and a plentiful degree\nof speculative license to political and moral sanity. Indirectly, but\nsurely, goodness, virtue, law, (of the very best,) follow freedom.\nThese, to democracy, are what the keel is to the ship, or saltness to\nthe ocean.\n\nThe true gravitation-hold of liberalism in the United States will be\na more universal ownership of property, general homesteads, general\ncomfort--a vast, intertwining reticulation of wealth. As the human\nframe, or, indeed, any object in this manifold universe, is best kept\ntogether by the simple miracle of its own cohesion, and the necessity,\nexercise and profit thereof, so a great and varied nationality,\noccupying millions of square miles, were firmest held and knit by the\nprinciple of the safety and endurance of the aggregate of its middling\nproperty owners. So that, from another point of view, ungracious as it\nmay sound, and a paradox after what we have been saying, democracy looks\nwith suspicious, ill-satisfied eye upon the very poor, the ignorant, and\non those out of business. She asks for men and women with occupations,\nwell-off, owners of houses and acres, and with cash in the bank--and\nwith some cravings for literature, too; and must have them, and hastens\nto make them. Luckily, the seed is already well-sown, and has taken\nineradicable root.[25]\n\nHuge and mighty are our days, our republican lands--and most in their\nrapid shiftings, their changes, all in the interest of the cause. As I\nwrite this particular passage, (November, 1868,) the din of disputation\nrages around me. Acrid the temper of the parties, vital the pending\nquestions. Congress convenes; the President sends his message;\nreconstruction is still in abeyance; the nomination and the contest\nfor the twenty-first Presidentiad draw close, with loudest threat and\nbustle. Of these, and all the like of these, the eventuations I know\nnot; but well I know that behind them, and whatever their eventuations,\nthe vital things remain safe and certain, and all the needed work goes\non. Time, with soon or later superciliousness, disposes of Presidents,\nCongressmen, party platforms, and such. Anon, it clears the stage of\neach and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day; and\nat and after which, (with precious, golden exceptions once or twice in\na century,) all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in\na burial-vault, and no one bothers himself the least bit about it\nafterward. But the People ever remain, tendencies continue, and all the\nidiocratic transfers in unbroken chain go on.\n\nIn a few years the dominion-heart of America will be far inland, toward\nthe west. Our future national capital may not be where the present one\nis. It is possible, nay likely, that in less than fifty years, it will\nmigrate a thousand or two miles, will be re-founded, and every thing\nbelonging to it made on a different plan, original, far more superb. The\nmain social, political, spine-character of the States will probably run\nalong the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and west and north\nof them, including Canada. Those regions, with the group of powerful\nbrothers toward the Pacific, (destined to the mastership of that sea and\nits countless paradises of islands,) will compact and settle the traits\nof America, with all the old retain'd, but more expanded, grafted on\nnewer, hardier, purely native stock. A giant growth, composite from\nthe rest, getting their contribution, absorbing it, to make it more\nillustrious. From the north, intellect, the sun of things, also the idea\nof unswayable justice, anchor amid the last, the wildest tempests.\nFrom the south the living soul, the animus of good and bad, haughtily\nadmitting no demonstration but its own. While from the west itself\ncomes solid personality, with blood and brawn, and the deep quality of\nall-accepting fusion.\n\nPolitical democracy, as it exists and practically works in America,\nwith all its threatening evils, supplies a training-school for making\nfirst-class men. It is life's gymnasium, not of good only, but of\nall. We try often, though we fall back often. A brave delight, fit for\nfreedom's athletes, fills these arenas, and fully satisfies, out of the\naction in them, irrespective of success. Whatever we do not attain, we\nat any rate attain the experiences of the fight, the hardening of the\nstrong campaign, and throb with currents of attempt at least. Time is\nample. Let the victors come after us. Not for nothing does evil play\nits part among us. Judging from the main portions of the history of the\nworld, so far, justice is always in jeopardy, peace walks amid hourly\npitfalls, and of slavery, misery, meanness, the craft of tyrants and the\ncredulity of the populace, in some of their protean forms, no voice can\nat any time say, They are not. The clouds break a little, and the sun\nshines out--but soon and certain the lowering darkness falls again, as\nif to last forever. Yet is there an immortal courage and prophecy\nin every sane soul that cannot, must not, under any circumstances,\ncapitulate. _Vive_, the attack--the perennial assault! _Vive_, the\nunpopular cause--the spirit that audaciously aims--the never-abandon'd\nefforts, pursued the same amid opposing proofs and precedents.\n\nOnce, before the war, (alas! I dare not say how many times the mood has\ncome!) I, too, was fill'd with doubt and gloom. A foreigner, an acute\nand good man, had impressively said to me, that day--putting in form,\nindeed, my own observations: \"I have travel'd much in the United States,\nand watch'd their politicians, and listen'd to the speeches of the\ncandidates, and read the journals, and gone into the public houses, and\nheard the unguarded talk of men. And I have found your vaunted America\nhoneycomb'd from top to toe with infidelism, even to itself and its own\nprogramme. I have mark'd the brazen hell-faces of secession and slavery\ngazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways. I have everywhere\nfound, primarily, thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to\noffices, and sometimes filling the offices themselves. I have found the\nnorth just as full of bad stuff as the south. Of the holders of public\noffice in the Nation or the States or their municipalities, I have found\nthat not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection\nof the outsiders, the people, but all have been nominated and put\nthrough by little or large caucuses of the politicians, and have got\nin by corrupt rings and electioneering, not capacity or desert. I have\nnoticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the\nhelpless supple-jacks of comparatively few politicians. And I have\nnoticed more and more, the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the\ngovernment, and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes.\"\n\nSad, serious, deep truths. Yet are there other, still deeper, amply\nconfronting, dominating truths. Over those politicians and great and\nlittle rings, and over all their insolence and wiles, and over the\npowerfulest parties, looms a power, too sluggish maybe, but ever holding\ndecisions and decrees in hand, ready, with stern process, to execute\nthem as soon as plainly needed--and at times, indeed, summarily crushing\nto atoms the mightiest parties, even in the hour of their pride.\n\nIn saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what,\nat first sight, they appear. Though it is no doubt important who\nis elected governor, mayor, or legislator, (and full of dismay when\nincompetent or vile ones get elected, as they sometimes do,) there are\nother, quieter contingencies, infinitely more important. Shams, &c.,\nwill always be the show, like ocean's scum; enough, if waters deep and\nclear make up the rest. Enough, that while the piled embroider'd shoddy\ngaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye, the hidden warp and weft\nare genuine, and will wear forever. Enough, in short, that the race,\nthe land which could raise such as the late rebellion, could also put it\ndown. The average man of a land at last only is important. He, in these\nStates, remains immortal owner and boss, deriving good uses, somehow,\nout of any sort of servant in office, even the basest; (certain\nuniversal requisites, and their settled regularity and protection, being\nfirst secured,) a nation like ours, in a sort of geological formation\nstate, trying continually new experiments, choosing new delegations,\nis not served by the best men only, but sometimes more by those that\nprovoke it--by the combats they arouse. Thus national rage, fury,\ndiscussions, &c., better than content. Thus, also, the warning signals,\ninvaluable for after times.\n\nWhat is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated, and\ndoubtless long shall see--the popular judgment taking the successful\ncandidates on trial in the offices--standing off, as it were, and\nobserving them and their doings for a while, and always giving, finally,\nthe fit, exactly due reward? I think, after all, the sublimest part of\npolitical history, and its culmination, is currently issuing from\nthe American people. I know nothing grander, better exercise, better\ndigestion, more positive proof of the past, the triumphant result of\nfaith in human-kind, than a well-contested American national election.\n\nThen still the thought returns, (like the thread-passage in overtures,)\ngiving the key and echo to these pages. When I pass to and fro,\ndifferent latitudes, different seasons, beholding the crowds of the\ngreat cities, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Chicago, St.\nLouis, San Francisco, New Orleans, Baltimore--when I mix with these\ninterminable swarms of alert, turbulent, good-natured, independent\ncitizens, mechanics, clerks, young persons--at the idea of this mass\nof men, so fresh and free, so loving and so proud, a singular awe falls\nupon me. I feel, with dejection and amazement, that among our geniuses\nand talented writers or speakers, few or none have yet really spoken to\nthis people, created a single image-making work for them, or absorb'd\nthe central spirit and the idiosyncrasies which are theirs--and\nwhich, thus, in highest ranges, so far remain entirely uncelebrated,\nunexpress'd.\n\nDominion strong is the body's; dominion stronger is the mind's. What\nhas fill'd, and fills to-day our intellect, our fancy, furnishing the\nstandards therein, is yet foreign. The great poems, Shakspere included,\nare poisonous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people,\nthe life-blood of democracy. The models of our literature, as we get\nit from other lands, ultra-marine, have had their birth in courts, and\nbask'd and grown in castle sunshine; all smells of princes' favors. Of\nworkers of a certain sort, we have, indeed, plenty, contributing after\ntheir kind; many elegant, many learn'd, all complacent. But touch'd by\nthe national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality,\nthey wither to ashes. I say I have not seen a single writer, artist,\nlecturer, or what-not, that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect\nand active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the\nland, in a spirit kindred to itself. Do you call those genteel little\ncreatures American poets? Do you term that perpetual, pistareen,\npaste-pot work, American art, American drama, taste, verse? I think I\nhear, echoed as from some mountain-top afar in the west, the scornful\nlaugh of the Genius of these States.\n\nDemocracy, in silence, biding its time, ponders its own ideals, not of\nliterature and art only--not of men only, but of women. The idea of the\nwomen of America, (extricated from this daze, this fossil and unhealthy\nair which hangs about the word _lady_,) develop'd, raised to become the\nrobust equals, workers, and, it may be, even practical and political\ndeciders with the men--greater than man, we may admit, through their\ndivine maternity, always their towering, emblematical attribute--but\ngreat, at any rate, as man, in all departments; or, rather, capable of\nbeing so, soon as they realize it, and can bring themselves to give up\ntoys and fictions, and launch forth, as men do, amid real, independent,\nstormy life.\n\nThen, as towards our thought's finale, (and, in that, overarching the\ntrue scholar's lesson,) we have to say there can be no complete or\nepical presentation of democracy in the aggregate, or anything like it,\nat this day, because its doctrines will only be effectually incarnated\nin any one branch, when, in all, their spirit is at the root and centre.\nFar, far, indeed, stretch, in distance, our Vistas! How much is still\nto be disentangled, freed! How long it takes to make this American world\nsee that it is, in itself, the final authority and reliance!\n\nDid you, too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for elections, for\npolitics, and for a party name? I say democracy is only of use there\nthat it may pass on and come to its flower and fruits in manners, in\nthe highest forms of interaction between men, and their beliefs--in\nreligion, literature, colleges, and schools--democracy in all public and\nprivate life, and in the army and navy.[26] I have intimated that, as a\nparamount scheme, it has yet few or no full realizers and believers.\nI do not see, either, that it owes any serious thanks to noted\npropagandists or champions, or has been essentially help'd, though often\nharm'd, by them. It has been and is carried on by all the moral forces,\nand by trade, finance, machinery, intercommunications, and, in fact,\nby all the developments of history, and can no more be stopp'd than the\ntides, or the earth in its orbit. Doubtless, also, it resides, crude and\nlatent, well down in the hearts of the fair average of the American-born\npeople, mainly in the agricultural regions. But it is not yet, there or\nanywhere, the fully-receiv'd, the fervid, the absolute faith.\n\nI submit, therefore, that the fruition of democracy, on aught like a\ngrand scale, resides altogether in the future. As, under any profound\nand comprehensive view of the gorgeous-composite feudal world, we see\nin it, through the long ages and cycles of ages, the results of a deep,\nintegral, human and divine principle, or fountain, from which issued\nlaws, ecclesia, manners, institutes, costumes, personalities, poems,\n(hitherto unequall'd,) faithfully partaking of their source, and\nindeed only arising either to betoken it, or to furnish parts of that\nvaried-flowing display, whose centre was one and absolute--so, long\nages hence, shall the due historian or critic make at least an equal\nretrospect, an equal history for the democratic principle. It too must\nbe adorn'd, credited with its results--then, when it, with imperial\npower, through amplest time, has dominated mankind--has been the source\nand test of all the moral, esthetic, social, political, and religious\nexpressions and institutes of the civilized world--has begotten them\nin spirit and in form, and has carried them to its own unprecedented\nheights--has had, (it is possible,) monastics and ascetics, more\nnumerous, more devout than the monks and priests of all previous\ncreeds--has sway'd the ages with a breadth and rectitude tallying\nNature's own--has fashion'd, systematized, and triumphantly finish'd and\ncarried out, in its own interest, and with unparallel'd success, a new\nearth and a new man.\n\nThus we presume to write, as it were, upon things that exist not, and\ntravel by maps yet unmade, and a blank. But the throes of birth are\nupon us; and we have something of this advantage in seasons of strong\nformations, doubts, suspense--for then the afflatus of such themes haply\nmay fall upon us, more or less; and then, hot from surrounding war and\nrevolution, our speech, though without polish'd coherence, and a failure\nby the standard called criticism, comes forth, real at least as the\nlightnings.\n\nAnd may-be we, these days, have, too, our own reward--(for there are yet\nsome, in all lands, worthy to be so encouraged.) Though not for us the\njoy of entering at the last the conquer'd city--not ours the chance ever\nto see with our own eyes the peerless power and splendid _eclat_ of\nthe democratic principle, arriv'd at meridian, filling the world with\neffulgence and majesty far beyond those of past history's kings, or\nall dynastic sway--there is yet, to whoever is eligible among us, the\nprophetic vision, the joy of being toss'd in the brave turmoil of these\ntimes--the promulgation and the path, obedient, lowly reverent to the\nvoice, the gesture of the god, or holy ghost, which others see not, hear\nnot--with the proud consciousness that amid whatever clouds, seductions,\nor heart-wearying postponements, we have never deserted, never\ndespair'd, never abandon'd the faith.\n\nSo much contributed, to be conn'd well, to help prepare and brace our\nedifice, our plann'd Idea--we still proceed to give it in another of its\naspects--perhaps the main, the high facade of all. For to democracy,\nthe leveler, the unyielding principle of the average, is surely join'd\nanother principle, equally unyielding, closely tracking the first,\nindispensable to it, opposite, (as the sexes are opposite,) and whose\nexistence, confronting and ever modifying the other, often clashing,\nparadoxical, yet neither of highest avail without the other,\nplainly supplies to these grand cosmic politics of ours, and to the\nlaunch'd-forth mortal dangers of republicanism, to-day or any day, the\ncounterpart and offset whereby Nature restrains the deadly original\nrelentlessness of all her first-class laws. This second principle is\nindividuality, the pride and centripetal isolation of a human being in\nhimself--identity--personalism. Whatever the name, its acceptance and\nthorough infusion through the organizations of political commonalty now\nshooting Aurora-like about the world, are of utmost importance, as the\nprinciple itself is needed for very life's sake. It forms, in a sort,\nor is to form, the compensating balance-wheel of the successful working\nmachinery of aggregate America.\n\nAnd, if we think of it, what does civilization itself rest upon--and\nwhat object has it, with its religions, arts, schools, &c., but rich,\nluxuriant, varied personalism? To that, all bends; and it is because\ntoward such result democracy alone, on anything like Nature's scale,\nbreaks up the limitless fallows of humankind, and plants the seed, and\ngives fair play, that its claims now precede the rest. The literature,\nsongs, esthetics, &c., of a country are of importance principally\nbecause they furnish the materials and suggestions of personality\nfor the women and men of that country, and enforce them in a thousand\neffective ways.[27] As the topmost claim of a strong consolidating\nof the nationality of these States, is, that only by such powerful\ncompaction can the separate States secure that full and free swing\nwithin their spheres, which is becoming to them, each after its kind,\nso will individuality, with unimpeded branchings, flourish best under\nimperial republican forms.\n\nAssuming Democracy to be at present in its embryo condition, and that\nthe only large and satisfactory justification of it resides in the\nfuture, mainly through the copious production of perfect characters\namong the people, and through the advent of a sane and pervading\nreligiousness, it is with regard to the atmosphere and spaciousness\nfit for such characters, and of certain nutriment and cartoon-draftings\nproper for them, and indicating them for New-World purposes, that\nI continue the present statement--an exploration, as of new ground,\nwherein, like other primitive surveyors, I must do the best I can,\nleaving it to those who come after me to do much better. (The service,\nin fact, if any, must be to break a sort of first path or track, no\nmatter how rude and ungeometrical.)\n\nWe have frequently printed the word Democracy. Yet I cannot too often\nrepeat that it is a word the real gist of which still sleeps, quite\nunawaken'd, notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests\nout of which its syllables have come, from pen or tongue. It is a great\nword, whose history, I suppose, remains unwritten, because that history\nhas yet to be enacted. It is, in some sort, younger brother of another\ngreat and often-used word, Nature, whose history also waits unwritten.\nAs I perceive, the tendencies of our day, in the States, (and I entirely\nrespect them,) are toward those vast and sweeping movements, influences,\nmoral and physical, of humanity, now and always current over the planet,\non the scale of the impulses of the elements. Then it is also good to\nreduce the whole matter to the consideration of a single self, a man, a\nwoman, on permanent grounds. Even for the treatment of the universal, in\npolitics, metaphysics, or anything, sooner or later we come down to one\nsingle, solitary soul.\n\nThere is, in sanest hours, a consciousness, a thought that rises,\nindependent, lifted out from all else, calm, like the stars, shining\neternal. This is the thought of identity--yours for you, whoever\nyou are, as mine for me. Miracle of miracles, beyond statement, most\nspiritual and vaguest of earth's dreams, yet hardest basic fact, and\nonly entrance to all facts. In such devout hours, in the midst of the\nsignificant wonders of heaven and earth, (significant only because of\nthe Me in the centre,) creeds, conventions, fall away and become of no\naccount before this simple idea. Under the luminousness of real vision,\nit alone takes possession, takes value. Like the shadowy dwarf in the\nfable, 'once liberated and look'd upon, it expands over the whole earth,\nand spreads to the roof of heaven.\n\nThe quality of BEING, in the object's self, according to its own central\nidea and purpose, and of growing therefrom and thereto--not criticism by\nother standards, and adjustments thereto--is the lesson of Nature.\nTrue, the full man wisely gathers, culls, absorbs; but if, engaged\ndisproportionately in that, he slights or overlays the precious\nidiocrasy and special nativity and intention that he is, the man's self,\nthe main thing, is a failure, however wide his general cultivation.\nThus, in our times, refinement and delicatesse are not only attended\nto sufficiently, but threaten to eat us up, like a cancer. Already, the\ndemocratic genius watches, ill-pleased, these tendencies. Provision for\na little healthy rudeness, savage virtue, justification of what one has\nin one's self, whatever it is, is demanded. Negative qualities, even\ndeficiencies, would be a relief. Singleness and normal simplicity\nand separation, amid this more and more complex, more and more\nartificialized state of society--how pensively we yearn for them! how we\nwould welcome their return!\n\nIn some such direction, then--at any rate enough to preserve the\nbalance--we feel called upon to throw what weight we can, not for\nabsolute reasons, but current ones. To prune, gather, trim, conform, and\never cram and stuff, and be genteel and proper, is the pressure of our\ndays. While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this,\nwe perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what\nis demanded to serve a half-starved and barbarous nation, or set of\nnations, but what is most applicable, most pertinent, for numerous\ncongeries of conventional, over-corpulent societies, already becoming\nstifled and rotten with flatulent, infidelistic literature, and polite\nconformity and art. In addition to establish'd sciences, we suggest a\nscience as it were of healthy average personalism, on original-universal\ngrounds, the object of which should be to raise up and supply through\nthe States a copious race of superb American men and women, cheerful,\nreligious, ahead of any yet known.\n\nAmerica has yet morally and artistically originated nothing. She seems\nsingularly unaware that the models of persons, books, manners, &c.,\nappropriate for former conditions and for European lands, are but exiles\nand exotics here. No current of her life, as shown on the surfaces of\nwhat is authoritatively called her society, accepts or runs into social\nor esthetic democracy; but all the currents set squarely against it.\nNever, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholster'd exterior appearance\nand show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea of caste, and on\nthe sufficiency of mere outside acquisition--never were glibness, verbal\nintellect, more the test, the emulation--more loftily elevated as head\nand sample--than they are on the surface of our republican States this\nday. The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods. The word of the\nmodern, say these voices, is the word Culture.\n\nWe find ourselves abruptly in close quarters with the enemy. This word\nCulture, or what it has come to represent, involves, by contrast, our\nwhole theme, and has been, indeed, the spur, urging us to engagement.\nCertain questions arise. As now taught, accepted and carried out, are\nnot the processes of culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious\ninfidels, who believe in nothing? Shall a man lose himself in countless\nmasses of adjustments, and be so shaped with reference to this, that,\nand the other, that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him\nare reduced and clipp'd away, like the bordering of box in a garden? You\ncan cultivate corn and roses and orchards--but who shall cultivate the\nmountain peaks, the ocean, and the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds?\nLastly--is the readily-given reply that culture only seeks to help,\nsystematize, and put in attitude, the elements of fertility and power, a\nconclusive reply?\n\nI do not so much object to the name, or word, but I should certainly\ninsist, for the purposes of these States, on a radical change of\ncategory, in the distribution of precedence. I should demand a programme\nof culture, drawn out, not for a single class alone, or for the parlors\nor lecture-rooms, but with an eye to practical life, the west, the\nworking-men, the facts of farms and jack-planes and engineers, and of\nthe broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata,\nand with reference to the perfect equality of women, and of a grand and\npowerful motherhood. I should demand of this programme or theory a scope\ngenerous enough to include the widest human area. It must have for its\nspinal meaning the formation of a typical personality of character,\neligible to the uses of the high average of men--and _not_ restricted\nby conditions ineligible to the masses. The best culture will always be\nthat of the manly and courageous instincts, and loving perceptions, and\nof self-respect--aiming to form, over this continent, an idiocrasy\nof universalism, which, true child of America, will bring joy to its\nmother, returning to her in her own spirit, recruiting myriads of\noffspring, able, natural, perceptive, tolerant, devout believers in\nher, America, and with some definite instinct why and for what she has\narisen, most vast, most formidable of historic births, and is, now and\nhere, with wonderful step, journeying through Time.\n\nThe problem, as it seems to me, presented to the New World, is,\nunder permanent law and order, and after preserving cohesion,\n(ensemble-individuality,) at all hazards, to vitalize man's free play of\nspecial Personalism, recognizing in it something that calls ever more\nto be consider'd, fed, and adopted as the substratum for the best\nthat belongs to us, (government indeed is for it,) including the new\nesthetics of our future.\n\nTo formulate beyond this present vagueness--to help line and put\nbefore us the species, or a specimen of the species, of the democratic\nethnology of the future, is a work toward which the genius of our land,\nwith peculiar encouragement, invites her well-wishers. Already certain\nlimnings, more or less grotesque, more or less fading and watery, have\nappear'd. We too, (repressing doubts and qualms,) will try our hand.\n\nAttempting, then, however crudely, a basic model or portrait of\npersonality for general use for the manliness of the States, (and\ndoubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive\nfor all, and toned low enough,) we should prepare the canvas well\nbeforehand. Parentage must consider itself in advance. (Will the time\nhasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a science--and the\nnoblest science?) To our model, a clear-blooded, strong-fibred\nphysique, is indispensable; the questions of food, drink, air, exercise,\nassimilation, digestion, can never be intermitted. Out of these we\ndescry a well-begotten selfhood--in youth, fresh, ardent, emotional,\naspiring, full of adventure; at maturity, brave, perceptive, under\ncontrol, neither too talkative nor too reticent, neither flippant nor\nsombre; of the bodily figure, the movements easy, the complexion showing\nthe best blood, somewhat flush'd, breast expanded, an erect attitude,\na voice whose sound outvies music, eyes of calm and steady gaze, yet\ncapable also of flashing--and a general presence that holds its own\nin the company of the highest. (For it is native personality, and that\nalone, that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals, or in\nany distinguish'd collection, with _aplomb_--and _not_ culture, or any\nknowledge or intellect whatever.) With regard to the mental-educational\npart of our model, enlargement of intellect, stores of cephalic\nknowledge, &c., the concentration thitherward of all the customs of our\nage, especially in America, is so overweening, and provides so fully\nfor that part, that, important and necessary as it is, it really needs\nnothing from us here--except, indeed, a phrase of warning and restraint.\nManners, costumes, too, though important, we need not dwell upon here.\nLike beauty, grace of motion, &c., they are results. Causes, original\nthings, being attended to, the right manners unerringly follow. Much\nis said, among artists, of \"the grand style,\" as if it were a thing by\nitself. When a man, artist or whoever, has health, pride, acuteness,\nnoble aspirations, he has the motive-elements of the grandest style. The\nrest is but manipulation, (yet that is no small matter.)\n\nLeaving still unspecified several sterling parts of any model fit for\nthe future personality of America, I must not fail, again and ever,\nto pronounce myself on one, probably the least attended to in modern\ntimes--a hiatus, indeed, threatening its gloomiest consequences after\nus. I mean the simple, unsophisticated Conscience, the primary moral\nelement. If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of\ndarkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should have to\npoint to this particular. I should demand the invariable application to\nindividuality, this day and any day, of that old, ever-true plumb-rule\nof persons, eras, nations. Our triumphant modern civilizee, with his\nall-schooling and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but\nan amputation while this deficiency remains. Beyond, (assuming a more\nhopeful tone,) the vertebration of the manly and womanly personalism\nof our western world, can only be, and is, indeed, to be, (I hope,) its\nall-penetrating Religiousness.\n\nThe ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of\nindividuality, and is a result that no organization or church can\never achieve. As history is poorly retain'd by what the technists call\nhistory, and is not given out from their pages, except the learner\nhas in himself the sense of the well-wrapt, never yet written, perhaps\nimpossible to be written, history--so Religion, although casually\narrested, and, after a fashion, preserv'd in the churches and creeds,\ndoes not depend at all upon them, but is a part of the identified\nsoul, which, when greatest, knows not bibles in the old way, but in new\nways--the identified soul, which can really confront Religion when it\nextricates itself entirely from the churches, and not before.\n\nPersonalism fuses this, and favors it. I should say, indeed, that only\nin the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the\nspirituality of religion positively come forth at all. Only here, and on\nsuch terms, the meditation, the devout ecstasy, the soaring flight.\nOnly here, communion with the mysteries, the eternal problems, whence?\nwhither? Alone, and identity, and the mood--and the soul emerges, and\nall statements, churches, sermons, melt away like vapors. Alone,\nand silent thought and awe, and aspiration--and then the interior\nconsciousness, like a hitherto unseen inscription, in magic ink, beams\nout its wondrous lines to the sense. Bibles may convey, and priests\nexpound, but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one's\nisolated Self, to enter the pure ether of veneration, reach the divine\nlevels, and commune with the unutterable.\n\n\nTo practically enter into politics is an important part of American\npersonalism. To every young man, north and south, earnestly studying\nthese things, I should here, as an offset to what I have said in former\npages, now also say, that may be to views of very largest scope, after\nall, perhaps the political, (perhaps the literary and sociological,)\nAmerica goes best about its development its own way--sometimes, to\ntemporary sight, appaling enough. It is the fashion among dillettants\nand fops (perhaps I myself am not guiltless,) to decry the whole\nformulation of the active politics of America, as beyond redemption, and\nto be carefully kept away from. See you that you do not fall into\nthis error. America, it may be, is doing very well upon the whole,\nnotwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders, these\nhalf-brain'd nominees, the many ignorant ballots, and many elected\nfailures and blatherers. It is the dillettants, and all who shirk their\nduty, who are not doing well. As for you, I advise you to enter more\nstrongly yet into politics. I advise every young man to do so. Always\ninform yourself; always do the best you can; always vote. Disengage\nyourself from parties. They have been useful, and to some extent remain\nso; but the floating, uncommitted electors, farmers, clerks, mechanics,\nthe masters of parties--watching aloof, inclining victory this side\nor that side--such are the ones most needed, present and future. For\nAmerica, if eligible at all to downfall and ruin, is eligible within\nherself, not without; for I see clearly that the combined foreign world\ncould not beat her down. But these savage, wolfish parties alarm me.\nOwning no law but their own will, more and more combative, less and less\ntolerant of the idea of ensemble and of equal brotherhood, the perfect\nequality of the States, the ever-overarching American ideas, it behooves\nyou to convey yourself implicitly to no party, nor submit blindly to\ntheir dictators, but steadily hold yourself judge and master over all of\nthem.\n\nSo much, (hastily toss'd together, and leaving far more unsaid,) for\nan ideal, or intimations of an ideal, toward American manhood. But the\nother sex, in our land, requires at least a basis of suggestion.\n\nI have seen a young American woman, one of a large family of daughters,\nwho, some years since, migrated from her meagre country home to one of\nthe northern cities, to gain her own support. She soon became an expert\nseamstress, but finding the employment too confining for health and\ncomfort, she went boldly to work for others, to house-keep, cook, clean,\n&c. After trying several places, she fell upon one where she was suited.\nShe has told me that she finds nothing degrading in her position; it is\nnot inconsistent with personal dignity, self-respect, and the respect of\nothers. She confers benefits and receives them. She has good health; her\npresence itself is healthy and bracing; her character is unstain'd; she\nhas made herself understood, and preserves her independence, and has\nbeen able to help her parents, and educate and get places for her\nsisters; and her course of life is not without opportunities for mental\nimprovement, and of much quiet, uncosting happiness and love.\n\nI have seen another woman who, from taste and necessity conjoin'd, has\ngone into practical affairs, carries on a mechanical business, partly\nworks at it herself, dashes out more and more into real hardy life, is\nnot abash'd by the coarseness of the contact, knows how to be firm\nand silent at the same time, holds her own with unvarying coolness and\ndecorum, and will compare, any day, with superior carpenters, farmers,\nand even boatmen and drivers. For all that, she has not lost the charm\nof the womanly nature, but preserves and bears it fully, though through\nsuch rugged presentation.\n\nThen there is the wife of a mechanic, mother of two children, a woman of\nmerely passable English education, but of fine wit, with all her\nsex's grace and intuitions, who exhibits, indeed, such a noble female\npersonality, that I am fain to record it here. Never abnegating her own\nproper independence, but always genially preserving it, and what\nbelongs to it--cooking, washing, child-nursing, house-tending--she\nbeams sunshine out of all these duties, and makes them illustrious.\nPhysiologically sweet and sound, loving work, practical, she yet knows\nthat there are intervals, however few, devoted to recreation, music,\nleisure, hospitality--and affords such intervals. Whatever she does,\nand wherever she is, that charm, that indescribable perfume of genuine\nwomanhood attends her, goes with her, exhales from her, which belongs of\nright to all the sex, and is, or ought to be, the invariable atmosphere\nand common aureola of old as well as young.\n\nMy dear mother once described to me a resplendent person, down on Long\nIsland, whom she knew in early days. She was known by the name of the\nPeacemaker. She was well toward eighty years old, of happy and sunny\ntemperament, had always lived on a farm, and was very neighborly,\nsensible and discreet, an invariable and welcom'd favorite, especially\nwith young married women. She had numerous children and grandchildren.\nShe was uneducated, but possess'd a native dignity. She had come to be a\ntacitly agreed upon domestic regulator, judge, settler of difficulties,\nshepherdess, and reconciler in the land. She was a sight to draw near\nand look upon, with her large figure, her profuse snow-white hair,\n(uncoil'd by any head-dress or cap,) dark eyes, clear complexion, sweet\nbreath, and peculiar personal magnetism.\n\nThe foregoing portraits, I admit, are frightfully out of line from these\nimported models of womanly personality--the stock feminine characters of\nthe current novelists, or of the foreign court poems, (Ophelias, Enids,\nprincesses, or ladies of one thing or another,) which fill the envying\ndreams of so many poor girls, and are accepted by our men, too, as\nsupreme ideals of feminine excellence to be sought after. But I present\nmine just for a change.\n\nThen there are mutterings, (we will not now stop to heed them here, but\nthey must be heeded,) of something more revolutionary. The day is coming\nwhen the deep questions of woman's entrance amid the arenas of practical\nlife, politics, the suffrage, &c., will not only be argued all around\nus, but may be put to decision, and real experiment.\n\nOf course, in these States, for both man and woman, we must entirely\nrecast the types of highest personality from what the oriental, feudal,\necclesiastical worlds bequeath us, and which yet possess the imaginative\nand esthetic fields of the United States, pictorial and melodramatic,\nnot without use as studies, but making sad work, and forming a strange\nanachronism upon the scenes and exigencies around us. Of course, the old\nundying elements remain. The task is, to successfully adjust them to new\ncombinations, our own days. Nor is this so incredible. I can conceive a\ncommunity, to-day and here, in which, on a sufficient scale, the\nperfect personalities, without noise meet; say in some pleasant western\nsettlement or town, where a couple of hundred best men and women, of\nordinary worldly status, have by luck been drawn together, with nothing\nextra of genius or wealth, but virtuous, chaste, industrious, cheerful,\nresolute, friendly and devout. I can conceive such a community organized\nin running order, powers judiciously delegated--farming, building,\ntrade, courts, mails, schools, elections, all attended to; and then the\nrest of life, the main thing, freely branching and blossoming in each\nindividual, and bearing golden fruit. I can see there, in every young\nand old man, after his kind, and in every woman after hers, a true\npersonality, develop'd, exercised proportionately in body, mind,\nand spirit. I can imagine this case as one not necessarily rare or\ndifficult, but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and general\nrequirements of our times. And I can realize in it the culmination\nof something better than any stereotyped _eclat_ of history or poems.\nPerhaps, unsung, undramatized, unput in essays or biographies--perhaps\neven some such community already exists, in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, or\nsomewhere, practically fulfilling itself, and thus outvying, in cheapest\nvulgar life, all that has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures.\n\nIn short, and to sum up, America, betaking herself to formative\naction, (as it is about time for more solid achievement, and less\nwindy promise,) must, for her purposes, cease to recognize a theory of\ncharacter grown of feudal aristocracies, or form'd by merely literary\nstandards, or from any ultramarine, full-dress formulas of culture,\npolish, caste, &c., and must sternly promulgate her own new standard,\nyet old enough, and accepting the old, the perennial elements, and\ncombining them into groups, unities, appropriate to the modern, the\ndemocratic, the west, and to the practical occasions and needs of our\nown cities, and of the agricultural regions. Ever the most precious in\nthe common. Ever the fresh breeze of field, or hill, or lake, is\nmore than any palpitation of fans, though of ivory, and redolent with\nperfume; and the air is more than the costliest perfumes.\n\nAnd now, for fear of mistake, we may not intermit to beg our absolution\nfrom all that genuinely is, or goes along with, even Culture. Pardon us,\nvenerable shade! if we have seem'd to speak lightly of your office. The\nwhole civilization of the earth, we know, is yours, with all the glory\nand the light thereof. It is, indeed, in your own spirit, and seeking to\ntally the loftiest teachings of it, that we aim these poor utterances.\nFor you, too, mighty minister! know that there is something greater than\nyou, namely, the fresh, eternal qualities of Being. From them, and by\nthem, as you, at your best, we too evoke the last, the needed help, to\nvitalize our country and our days. Thus we pronounce not so much against\nthe principle of culture; we only supervise it, and promulge along with\nit, as deep, perhaps a deeper, principle. As we have shown the New World\nincluding in itself the all-leveling aggregate of democracy, we show\nit also including the all-varied, all-permitting, all-free theorem of\nindividuality, and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied\nframework or platform, broad enough for all, eligible to every farmer\nand mechanic--to the female equally with the male--a towering selfhood,\nnot physically perfect only--not satisfied with the mere mind's and\nlearning's stores, but religious, possessing the idea of the infinite,\n(rudder and compass sure amid this troublous voyage, o'er darkest,\nwildest wave, through stormiest wind, of man's or nation's\nprogress)--realizing, above the rest, that known humanity, in deepest\nsense, is fair adhesion to itself, for purposes beyond--and that,\nfinally, the personality of mortal life is most important with reference\nto the immortal, the unknown, the spiritual, the only permanently real,\nwhich as the ocean waits for and receives the rivers, waits for us each\nand all.\n\nMuch is there, yet, demanding line and outline in our Vistas, not only\non these topics, but others quite unwritten. Indeed, we could talk the\nmatter, and expand it, through lifetime. But it is necessary to return\nto our original premises. In view of them, we have again pointedly\nto confess that all the objective grandeurs of the world, for highest\npurposes, yield themselves up, and depend on mentality alone. Here, and\nhere only, all balances, all rests. For the mind, which alone builds\nthe permanent edifice, haughtily builds it to itself. By it, with\nwhat follows it, are convey'd to mortal sense the culminations of\nthe materialistic, the known, and a prophecy of the unknown. To\ntake expression, to incarnate, to endow a literature with grand and\narchetypal models--to fill with pride and love the utmost capacity, and\nto achieve spiritual meanings, and suggest the future--these, and these\nonly, satisfy the soul. We must not say one word against real materials;\nbut the wise know that they do not become real till touched by emotions,\nthe mind. Did we call the latter imponderable? Ah, let us rather\nproclaim that the slightest song-tune, the countless ephemera of\npassions arous'd by orators and tale-tellers, are more dense, more\nweighty than the engines there in the great factories, or the granite\nblocks in their foundations.\n\nApproaching thus the momentous spaces, and considering with reference to\na new and greater personalism, the needs and possibilities of American\nimaginative literature, through the medium-light of what we have already\nbroach'd, it will at once be appreciated that a vast gulf of difference\nseparates the present accepted condition of these spaces, inclusive of\nwhat is floating in them, from any condition adjusted to, or fit for,\nthe world, the America, there sought to be indicated, and the copious\nraces of complete men and women, along these Vistas crudely outlined.\nIt is, in some sort, no less a difference than lies between that\nlong-continued nebular state and vagueness of the astronomical worlds,\ncompared with the subsequent state, the definitely-form'd worlds\nthemselves, duly compacted, clustering in systems, hung up there,\nchandeliers of the universe, beholding and mutually lit by each other's\nlights, serving for ground of all substantial foothold, all vulgar\nuses--yet serving still more as an undying chain and echelon of\nspiritual proofs and shows. A boundless field to fill! A new creation,\nwith needed orbic works launch'd forth, to revolve in free and lawful\ncircuits--to move, self-poised, through the ether, and shine like\nheaven's own suns! With such, and nothing less, we suggest that New\nWorld literature, fit to rise upon, cohere, and signalize in time, these\nStates.\n\nWhat, however, do we more definitely mean by New World literature? Are\nwe not doing well enough here already? Are not the United States this\nday busily using, working, more printer's type, more presses, than any\nother country? uttering and absorbing more publications than any other?\nDo not our publishers fatten quicker and deeper? (helping themselves,\nunder shelter of a delusive and sneaking law, or rather absence of law,\nto most of their forage, poetical, pictorial, historical, romantic,\neven comic, without money and without price--and fiercely resisting\nthe timidest proposal to pay for it.) Many will come under this\ndelusion--but my purpose is to dispel it. I say that a nation may\nhold and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print, journals,\nmagazines, novels, library-books, \"poetry,\" &c.--such as the States\nto-day possess and circulate--of unquestionable aid and value--hundreds\nof new volumes annually composed and brought out here, respectable\nenough, indeed unsurpass'd in smartness and erudition--with\nfurther hundreds, or rather millions, (as by free forage or theft\naforemention'd,) also thrown into the market--and yet, all the while,\nthe said nation, land, strictly speaking, may possess no literature at\nall.\n\nRepeating our inquiry, what, then, do we mean by real literature?\nespecially the democratic literature of the future? Hard questions to\nmeet. The clues are inferential, and turn us to the past. At best, we\ncan only offer suggestions, comparisons, circuits.\n\nIt must still be reiterated, as, for the purpose of these memoranda, the\ndeep lesson of history and time, that all else in the contributions of\na nation or age, through its politics, materials, heroic personalities,\nmilitary eclat, &c., remains crude, and defers, in any close and\nthorough-going estimate, until vitalized by national, original\narchetypes in literature. They only put the nation in form, finally tell\nanything--prove, complete anything--perpetuate anything. Without doubt,\nsome of the richest and most powerful and populous communities of the\nantique world, and some of the grandest personalities and events, have,\nto after and present times, left themselves entirely unbequeath'd.\nDoubtless, greater than any that have come down to us, were among those\nlands, heroisms, persons, that have not come down to us at all, even\nby name, date, or location. Others have arrived safely, as from voyages\nover wide, century-stretching seas. The little ships, the miracles that\nhave buoy'd them, and by incredible chances safely convey'd them, (or\nthe best of them, their meaning and essence,) overlong wastes, darkness,\nlethargy, ignorance, &c., have been a few inscriptions--a few immortal\ncompositions, small in size, yet compassing what measureless values of\nreminiscence, contemporary portraitures, manners, idioms and beliefs,\nwith deepest inference, hint and thought, to tie and touch forever the\nold, new body, and the old, new soul! These! and still these! bearing\nthe freight so dear--dearer than pride--dearer than love. All the best\nexperience of humanity, folded, saved, freighted to us here. Some of\nthese tiny ships we call Old and New Testament, Homer, Eschylus, Plato,\nJuvenal, &c. Precious minims! I think, if we were forced to choose,\nrather than have you, and the likes of you, and what belongs to, and has\ngrown of you, blotted out and gone, we could better afford, appaling as\nthat would be, to lose all actual ships, this day fasten'd by wharf,\nor floating on wave, and see them, with all their cargoes, scuttled and\nsent to the bottom.\n\nGather'd by geniuses of city, race or age, and put by them in highest\nof art's forms, namely, the literary form, the peculiar combinations\nand the outshows of that city, age, or race, its particular modes of the\nuniversal attributes and passions, its faiths, heroes, lovers and gods,\nwars, traditions, struggles, crimes, emotions, joys, (or the subtle\nspirit of these,) having been pass'd on to us to illumine our own\nselfhood, and its experiences--what they supply, indispensable and\nhighest, if taken away, nothing else in all the world's boundless\nstore-houses could make up to us, or ever again return.\n\nFor us, along the great highways of time, those monuments stand--those\nforms of majesty and beauty. For us those beacons burn through all the\nnights. Unknown Egyptians, graving hieroglyphs; Hindus, with hymn and\napothegm and endless epic; Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in\nflashes of lightning, conscience like red-hot iron, plaintive songs and\nscreams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement; Christ, with bent\nhead, brooding love and peace, like a dove; Greek, creating eternal\nshapes of physical and esthetic proportion; Roman, lord of satire, the\nsword, and the codex;--of the figures, some far off and veil'd, others\nnearer and visible; Dante, stalking with lean form, nothing but fibre,\nnot a grain of superfluous flesh; Angelo, and the great painters,\narchitects, musicians; rich Shakspere, luxuriant as the sun, artist and\nsinger of feudalism in its sunset, with all the gorgeous colors, owner\nthereof, and using them at will; and so to such as German Kant and\nHegel, where they, though near us, leaping over the ages, sit again,\nimpassive, imperturbable, like the Egyptian gods. Of these, and the like\nof these, is it too much, indeed, to return to our favorite figure,\nand view them as orbs and systems of orbs, moving in free paths in the\nspaces of that other heaven, the kosmic intellect, the soul?\n\nYe powerful and resplendent ones! ye were, in your atmospheres, grown\nnot for America, but rather for her foes, the feudal and the old--while\nour genius is democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe\nyour breath of life into our New World's nostrils--not to enslave us, as\nnow, but, for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own--perhaps, (dare\nwe to say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left!\nOn your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, must we mete\nand measure for to-day and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with\nunconditional uncompromising sway. Come forth, sweet democratic despots\nof the west!\n\nBy points like these we, in reflection, token what we mean by any land's\nor people's genuine literature. And thus compared and tested, judging\namid the influence of loftiest products only, what do our current\ncopious fields of print, covering in manifold forms, the United States,\nbetter, for an analogy, present, than, as in certain regions of the sea,\nthose spreading, undulating masses of squid, through which the whale\nswimming, with head half out, feeds?\n\nNot but that doubtless our current so-called literature, (like an\nendless supply of small coin,) performs a certain service, and may-be,\ntoo, the service needed for the time, (the preparation-service, as\nchildren learn to spell.) Everybody reads, and truly nearly everybody\nwrites, either books, or for the magazines or journals. The matter has\nmagnitude, too, after a sort. But is it really advancing? or, has it\nadvanced for a long while? There is something impressive about the huge\neditions of the dailies and weeklies, the mountain-stacks of white\npaper piled in the press-vaults, and the proud, crashing, ten-cylinder\npresses, which I can stand and watch any time by the half hour. Then,\n(though the States in the field of imagination present not a single\nfirst-class work, not a single great literatus,) the main objects,\nto amuse, to titillate, to pass away time, to circulate the news, and\nrumors of news, to rhyme and read rhyme, are yet attain'd, and on\na scale of infinity. To-day, in books, in the rivalry of writers,\nespecially novelists, success, (so-call'd,) is for him or her who\nstrikes the mean flat average, the sensational appetite for stimulus,\nincident, persiflage, &c., and depicts, to the common calibre, sensual,\nexterior life. To such, or the luckiest of them, as we see, the\naudiences are limitless and profitable; but they cease presently. While\nthis day, or any day, to workmen portraying interior or spiritual life,\nthe audiences were limited, and often laggard--but they last forever.\n\nCompared with the past, our modern science soars, and our journals\nserve--but ideal and even ordinary romantic literature, does not,\nI think, substantially advance. Behold the prolific brood of the\ncontemporary novel, magazine-tale, theatre-play, &c. The same endless\nthread of tangled and superlative love-story, inherited, apparently from\nthe Amadises and Palmerins of the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries over\nthere in Europe. The costumes and associations brought down to date, the\nseasoning hotter and more varied, the dragons and ogres left out--but\nthe _thing_, I should say, has not advanced--is just as sensational,\njust as strain'd--remains about the same, nor more, nor less.\n\nWhat is the reason our time, our lands, that we see no fresh local\ncourage, sanity, of our own--the Mississippi, stalwart Western men,\nreal mental and physical facts, Southerners, &c., in the body of our\nliterature? especially the poetic part of it. But always, instead, a\nparcel of dandies and ennuyees, dapper little gentlemen from abroad, who\nflood us with their thin sentiment of parlors, parasols, piano-songs,\ntinkling rhymes, the five-hundredth importation--or whimpering and\ncrying about something, chasing one aborted conceit after another,\nand forever occupied in dyspeptic amours with dyspeptic women. While,\ncurrent and novel, the grandest events and revolutions and stormiest\npassions of history, are crossing to-day with unparallel'd rapidity and\nmagnificence over the stages of our own and all the continents, offering\nnew materials, opening new vistas, with largest needs, inviting the\ndaring launching forth of conceptions in literature, inspired by them,\nsoaring in highest regions, serving art in its highest (which is only\nthe other name for serving God, and serving humanity,) where is the man\nof letters, where is the book, with any nobler aim than to follow in the\nold track, repeat what has been said before--and, as its utmost triumph,\nsell well, and be erudite or elegant?\n\nMark the roads, the processes, through which these States have arrived,\nstanding easy, henceforth ever-equal, ever-compact in their range\nto-day. European adventures? the most antique? Asiatic or African? old\nhistory--miracles--romances? Rather our own unquestion'd facts. They\nhasten, incredible, blazing bright as fire. From the deeds and days of\nColumbus down to the present, and including the present--and especially\nthe late secession war--when I con them, I feel, every leaf, like\nstopping to see if I have not made a mistake, and fall'n on the splendid\nfigments of some dream. But it is no dream. We stand, live, move, in\nthe huge flow of our age s materialism--in its spirituality. We have had\nfounded for us the most positive of lands. The founders have pass'd to\nother spheres--but what are these terrible duties they have left us?\n\nTheir politics the United States have, in my opinion, with all their\nfaults, already substantially establish'd, for good, on their own\nnative, sound, long-vista'd principles, never to be overturn'd, offering\na sure basis for all the rest. With that, their future religious forms\nsociology, literature, teachers, schools, costumes, &c., are of course\nto make a compact whole, uniform, on tallying principles. For how can\nwe remain, divided, contradicting ourselves, this way?[28] I say we can\nonly attain harmony and stability by consulting ensemble and the ethic\npurports, and faithfully building upon them. For the New World, indeed,\nafter two grand stages of preparation-strata, I perceive that now a\nthird stage, being ready for, (and without which the other two were\nuseless,) with unmistakable signs appears. The First stage was the\nplanning and putting on record the political foundation rights of\nimmense masses of people--indeed all people--in the organization of\nrepublican National, State, and municipal governments, all constructed\nwith reference to each, and each to all. This is the American programme,\nnot for classes, but for universal man, and is embodied in the compacts\nof the Declaration of Independence, and, as it began and has now\ngrown, with its amendments, the Federal Constitution--and in the State\ngovernments, with all their interiors, and with general suffrage; those\nhaving the sense not only of what is in themselves, but that their\ncertain several things started, planted, hundreds of others in the same\ndirection duly arise and follow. The Second stage relates to material\nprosperity, wealth, produce, labor-saving machines, iron, cotton, local,\nState and continental railways, intercommunication and trade with all\nlands, steamships, mining, general employment, organization of great\ncities, cheap appliances for comfort, numberless technical schools,\nbooks, newspapers, a currency for money circulation, &c. The\nThird stage, rising out of the previous ones, to make them and\nall illustrious, I, now, for one, promulge, announcing a native\nexpression-spirit, getting into form, adult, and through mentality, for\nthese States, self-contain'd, different from others, more expansive,\nmore rich and free, to be evidenced by original authors and poets\nto come, by American personalities, plenty of them, male and female,\ntraversing the States, none excepted--and by native superber\ntableaux and growths of language, songs, operas, orations, lectures,\narchitecture--and by a sublime and serious Religious Democracy sternly\ntaking command, dissolving the old, sloughing off surfaces, and from\nits own interior and vital principles, reconstructing, democratizing\nsociety.\n\nFor America, type of progress, and of essential faith in man, above\nall his errors and wickedness--few suspect how deep, how deep it really\nstrikes. The world evidently supposes, and we have evidently supposed\nso too, that the States are merely to achieve the equal franchise, an\nelective government--to inaugurate the respectability of labor, and\nbecome a nation of practical operatives, law-abiding, orderly and well\noff. Yes, those are indeed parts of the task of America; but they\nnot only do not exhaust the progressive conception, but rather arise,\nteeming with it, as the mediums of deeper, higher progress. Daughter of\na physical revolution--mother of the true revolutions, which are of\nthe interior life, and of the arts. For so long as the spirit is not\nchanged, any change of appearance is of no avail.\n\nThe old men, I remember as a boy, were always talking of American\nindependence. What is independence? Freedom from all laws or bonds\nexcept those of one's own being, control'd by the universal ones. To\nlands, to man, to woman, what is there at last to each, but the inherent\nsoul, nativity, idiocrasy, free, highest-poised, soaring its own flight,\nfollowing out itself?\n\nAt present, these States, in their theology and social standards, (of\ngreater importance than their political institutions,) are entirely held\npossession of by foreign lands. We see the sons and daughters of the\nNew World, ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the\nuniversal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and\nthe dead. We see London, Paris, Italy--not original, superb, as where\nthey belong--but second-hand here, where they do not belong. We see the\nshreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks; but where, on her own soil, do we\nsee, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I\nsometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.\n\nNot but that in one sense, and a very grand one, good theology, good\nart, or good literature, has certain features shared in common. The\ncombination fraternizes, ties the races--is, in many particulars, under\nlaws applicable indifferently to all, irrespective of climate or\ndate, and, from whatever source, appeals to emotions, pride, love,\nspirituality, common to human kind. Nevertheless, they touch a man\nclosest, (perhaps only actually touch him,) even in these, in their\nexpression through autochthonic lights and shades, flavors, fondnesses,\naversions, specific incidents, illustrations, out of his own\nnationality, geography, surroundings, antecedents, &c. The spirit and\nthe form are one, and depend far more on association, identity and\nplace, than is supposed. Subtly interwoven with the materiality\nand personality of a land, a race--Teuton, Turk, Californian, or\nwhat-not--there is always something--I can hardly tell what it\nis--history but describes the results of it--it is the same as the\nuntellable look of some human faces. Nature, too, in her stolid forms,\nis full of it--but to most it is there a secret. This something is\nrooted in the invisible roots, the profoundest meanings of that place,\nrace, or nationality; and to absorb and again effuse it, uttering words\nand products as from its midst, and carrying it into highest regions,\nis the work, or a main part of the work, of any country's true author,\npoet, historian, lecturer, and perhaps even priest and philosoph. Here,\nand here only, are the foundations for our really valuable and permanent\nverse, drama, &c.\n\nBut at present, (judged by any higher scale than that which finds the\nchief ends of existence to be to feverishly make money during one-half\nof it, and by some \"amusement,\" or perhaps foreign travel, flippantly\nkill time, the other half,) and consider'd with reference to purposes\nof patriotism, health, a noble personality, religion, and the democratic\nadjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic\nplays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of\nour best ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish\nno one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no\none, and suffice only the lowest level of vacant minds.\n\nOf what is called the drama, or dramatic presentation in the United\nStates, as now put forth at the theatres, I should say it deserves to\nbe treated with the same gravity, and on a par with the questions\nof ornamental confectionery at public dinners, or the arrangement of\ncurtains and hangings in a ball-room--nor more, nor less. Of the other,\nI will not insult the reader's intelligence, (once really entering into\nthe atmosphere of these Vistas,) by supposing it necessary to show,\nin detail, why the copious dribble, either of our little or well-known\nrhymesters, does not fulfil, in any respect, the needs and august\noccasions of this land. America demands a poetry that is bold, modern,\nand all-surrounding and kosmical, as she is herself. It must in no\nrespect ignore science or the modern, but inspire itself with science\nand the modern. It must bend its vision toward the future, more than\nthe past. Like America, it must extricate itself from even the greatest\nmodels of the past, and, while courteous to them, must have entire faith\nin itself, and the products of its own democratic spirit only. Like her,\nit must place in the van, and hold up at all hazards, the banner of\nthe divine pride of man in himself, (the radical foundation of the new\nreligion.) Long enough have the People been listening to poems in which\ncommon humanity, deferential, bends low, humiliated, acknowledging\nsuperiors. But America listens to no such poems. Erect, inflated, and\nfully self-esteeming be the chant; and then America will listen with\npleased ears.\n\nNor may the genuine gold, the gems, when brought to light at last, be\nprobably usher'd forth from any of the quarters currently counted on.\nTo-day, doubtless, the infant genius of American poetic expression,\n(eluding those highly-refined imported and gilt-edged themes,\nand sentimental and butterfly flights, pleasant to orthodox\npublishers--causing tender spasms in the coteries, and warranted not to\nchafe the sensitive cuticle of the most exquisitely artificial gossamer\ndelicacy,) lies sleeping far away, happily unrecognized and uninjur'd by\nthe coteries, the art-writers, the talkers and critics of the saloons,\nor the lecturers in the colleges--lies sleeping, aside, unrecking\nitself, in some western idiom, or native Michigan or Tennessee repartee,\nor stumpspeech--or in Kentucky or Georgia, or the Carolinas--or in some\nslang or local song or allusion of the Manhattan, Boston, Philadelphia\nor Baltimore mechanic--or up in the Maine woods--or off in the hut of\nthe California miner, or crossing the Rocky mountains, or along\nthe Pacific railroad--or on the breasts of the young farmers of\nthe northwest, or Canada, or boatmen of the lakes. Rude and coarse\nnursing-beds, these; but only from such beginnings and stocks,\nindigenous here, may haply arrive, be grafted, and sprout, in time,\nflowers of genuine American aroma, and fruits truly and fully our own.\n\nI say it were a standing disgrace to these States--I say it were a\ndisgrace to any nation, distinguish'd above others by the variety and\nvastness of its territories, its materials, its inventive activity,\nand the splendid practicality of its people, not to rise and soar above\nothers also in its original styles in literature and art, and its\nown supply of intellectual and esthetic masterpieces, archetypal, and\nconsistent with itself. I know not a land except ours that has not, to\nsome extent, however small, made its title clear. The Scotch have their\nborn ballads, subtly expressing their past and present, and expressing\ncharacter. The Irish have theirs. England, Italy, France, Spain, theirs.\nWhat has America? With exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic,\nlyric, tale, tune, picture, etc., in the Four Years' War; with, indeed,\nI sometimes think, the richest masses of material ever afforded a\nnation, more variegated, and on a larger scale--the first sign of\nproportionate, native, imaginative Soul, and first-class works to match,\nis, (I cannot too often repeat,) so far wanting.\n\nLong ere the second centennial arrives, there will be some forty to\nfifty great States, among them Canada and Cuba. When the present century\ncloses, our population will be sixty or seventy millions. The Pacific\nwill be ours, and the Atlantic mainly ours. There will be daily electric\ncommunication with every part of the globe. What an age! What a land!\nWhere, elsewhere, one so great? The individuality of one nation must\nthen, as always, lead the world. Can there be any doubt who the leader\nought to be? Bear in mind, though, that nothing less than the mightiest\noriginal non-subordinated SOUL has ever really, gloriously led, or ever\ncan lead. (This Soul--its other name, in these Vistas, is LITERATURE.)\n\nIn fond fancy leaping those hundred years ahead, let us survey America's\nworks, poems, philosophies, fulfilling prophecies, and giving form and\ndecision to best ideals. Much that is now undream'd of, we might then\nperhaps see establish'd, luxuriantly cropping forth, richness, vigor of\nletters and of artistic expression, in whose products character will be\na main requirement, and not merely erudition or elegance.\n\nIntense and loving comradeship, the personal and passionate attachment\nof man to man--which, hard to define, underlies the lessons and ideals\nof the profound saviours of every land and age, and which seems to\npromise, when thoroughly develop'd, cultivated and recognized in manners\nand literature, the most substantial hope and safety of the future of\nthese States, will then be fully express'd.[29]\n\nA strong fibred joyousness and faith, and the sense of health _al\nfresco_, may well enter into the preparation of future noble American\nauthorship. Part of the test of a great literatus shall be the absence\nin him of the idea of the covert, the lurid, the maleficent, the devil,\nthe grim estimates inherited from the Puritans, hell, natural depravity,\nand the like. The great literatus will be known, among the rest, by his\ncheerful simplicity, his adherence to natural standards, his limitless\nfaith in God, his reverence, and by the absence in him of doubt, ennui,\nburlesque, persiflage, or any strain'd and temporary fashion.\n\nNor must I fail, again and yet again, to clinch, reiterate more plainly\nstill, (O that indeed such survey as we fancy, may show in time this\npart completed also!) the lofty aim, surely the proudest and the purest,\nin whose service the future literatus, of whatever field, may gladly\nlabor. As we have intimated, offsetting the material civilization of our\nrace, our nationality, its wealth, territories, factories, population,\nproducts, trade, and military and naval strength, and breathing breath\nof life into all these, and more, must be its moral civilization--the\nformulation, expression, and aidancy whereof, is the very highest height\nof literature. The climax of this loftiest range of civilization, rising\nabove all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth, intellect, power,\nand art, as such--above even theology and religious fervor--is to be its\ndevelopment, from the eternal bases, and the fit expression, of absolute\nConscience, moral soundness, Justice. Even in religious fervor there\nis a touch of animal heat. But moral conscientiousness, crystalline,\nwithout flaw, not Godlike only, entirely human, awes and enchants\nforever. Great is emotional love, even in the order of the rational\nuniverse. But, if we must make gradations, I am clear there is something\ngreater. Power, love, veneration, products, genius, esthetics, tried by\nsubtlest comparisons, analyses, and in serenest moods, somewhere fail,\nsomehow become vain. Then noiseless, withflowing steps, the lord,\nthe sun, the last ideal comes. By the names right, justice, truth, we\nsuggest, but do not describe it. To the world of men it remains a\ndream, an idea as they call it. But no dream is it to the wise--but the\nproudest, almost only solid, lasting thing of all. Its analogy in the\nmaterial universe is what holds together this world, and every object\nupon it, and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe. Its lack,\nand the persistent shirking of it, as in life, sociology, literature,\npolitics, business, and even sermonizing, these times, or any times,\nstill leaves the abysm, the mortal flaw and smutch, mocking civilization\nto-day, with all its unquestion'd triumphs, and all the civilization so\nfar known.[30]\n\nPresent literature, while magnificently fulfilling certain popular\ndemands, with plenteous knowledge and verbal smartness, is profoundly\nsophisticated, insane, and its very joy is morbid. It needs tally and\nexpress Nature, and the spirit of Nature, and to know and obey the\nstandards. I say the question of Nature, largely consider'd, involves\nthe questions of the esthetic, the emotional, and the religious--and\ninvolves happiness. A fitly born and bred race, growing up in right\nconditions of out-door as much as in-door harmony, activity and\ndevelopment, would probably, from and in those conditions, find it\nenough merely _to live_--and would, in their relations to the sky, air,\nwater, trees, &c., and to the countless common shows, and in the fact of\nlife itself, discover and achieve happiness--with Being suffused night\nand day by wholesome extasy, surpassing all the pleasures that wealth,\namusement, and even gratified intellect, erudition, or the sense of art,\ncan give.\n\nIn the prophetic literature of these States, (the reader of my\nspeculations will miss their principal stress unless he allows well for\nthe point that a new Literature, perhaps a new Metaphysics, certainly a\nnew Poetry, are to be, in my opinion, the only sure and worthy supports\nand expressions of the American Democracy,) Nature, true Nature, and\nthe true idea of Nature, long absent, must, above all, become fully\nrestored, enlarged, and must furnish the pervading atmosphere to poems,\nand the test of all high literary and esthetic compositions. I do not\nmean the smooth walks, trimm'd hedges, poseys and nightingales of the\nEnglish poets, but the whole orb, with its geologic history, the kosmos,\ncarrying fire and snow, that rolls through the illimitable areas, light\nas a feather, though weighing billions of tons. Furthermore, as by\nwhat we now partially call Nature is intended, at most, only what is\nentertainable by the physical conscience, the sense of matter, and\nof good animal health--on these it must be distinctly accumulated,\nincorporated, that man, comprehending these, has, in towering\nsuperaddition, the moral and spiritual consciences, indicating his\ndestination beyond the ostensible, the mortal.\n\nTo the heights of such estimate of Nature indeed ascending, we proceed\nto make observations for our Vistas, breathing rarest air. What is\nI believe called Idealism seems to me to suggest, (guarding against\nextravagance, and ever modified even by its opposite,) the course\nof inquiry and desert of favor for our New World metaphysics, their\nfoundation of and in literature, giving hue to all.[31]\n\nThe elevating and etherealizing ideas of the unknown and of unreality\nmust be brought forward with authority, as they are the legitimate heirs\nof the known, and of reality, and at least as great as their parents.\nFearless of scoffing, and of the ostent, let us take our stand,\nour ground, and never desert it, to confront the growing excess and\narrogance of realism. To the cry, now victorious--the cry of sense,\nscience, flesh, incomes, farms, merchandise, logic, intellect,\ndemonstrations, solid perpetuities, buildings of brick and iron, or\neven the facts of the shows of trees, earth, rocks, &c., fear not, my\nbrethren, my sisters, to sound out with equally determin'd voice,\nthat conviction brooding within the recesses of every envision'd\nsoul--illusions! apparitions! figments all! True, we must not condemn\nthe show, neither absolutely deny it, for the indispensability of its\nmeanings; but how clearly we see that, migrate in soul to what we can\nalready conceive of superior and spiritual points of view, and, palpable\nas it seems under present relations, it all and several might, nay\ncertainly would, fall apart and vanish.\n\nI hail with joy the oceanic, variegated, intense practical energy, the\ndemand for facts, even the business materialism of the current age,\nour States. But we to the age or land in which these things, movements,\nstopping at themselves, do not tend to ideas. As fuel to flame, and\nflame to the heavens, so must wealth, science, materialism--even this\ndemocracy of which we make so much--unerringly feed the highest mind,\nthe soul. Infinitude the flight: fathomless the mystery. Man, so\ndiminutive, dilates beyond the sensible universe, competes with,\noutcopes space and time, meditating even one great idea. Thus, and\nthus only, does a human being, his spirit, ascend above, and justify,\nobjective Nature, which, probably nothing in itself, is incredibly and\ndivinely serviceable, indispensable, real, here. And as the purport\nof objective Nature is doubtless folded, hidden, somewhere here--as\nsomewhere here is what this globe and its manifold forms, and the light\nof day, and night's darkness, and life itself, with all its experiences,\nare for--it is here the great literature, especially verse, must get its\ninspiration and throbbing blood. Then may we attain to a poetry worthy\nthe immortal soul of man, and widen, while absorbing materials, and,\nin their own sense, the shows of Nature, will, above all, have, both\ndirectly and indirectly, a freeing, fluidizing, expanding, religious\ncharacter, exulting with science, fructifying the moral elements, and\nstimulating aspirations, and meditations on the unknown.\n\nThe process, so far, is indirect and peculiar, and though it may be\nsuggested, cannot be defined. Observing, rapport, and with intuition,\nthe shows and forms presented by Nature, the sensuous luxuriance, the\nbeautiful in living men and women, the actual play of passions, in\nhistory and life--and, above all, from those developments either in\nNature or human personality in which power, (dearest of all to the sense\nof the artist,) transacts itself-out of these, and seizing what is in\nthem, the poet, the esthetic worker in any field, by the divine magic\nof his genius, projects them, their analogies, by curious removes,\nindirections, in literature and art. (No useless attempt to repeat\nthe material creation, by daguerreotyping the exact likeness by mortal\nmental means.) This is the image-making faculty, coping with material\ncreation, and rivaling, almost triumphing over it. This alone, when\nall the other parts of a specimen of literature or art are ready and\nwaiting, can breathe into it the breath of life, and endow it with\nidentity.\n\n\"The true question to ask,\" says the librarian of Congress in a paper\nread before the Social Science Convention at New York, October, 1869,\n\"The true question to ask respecting a book, is, _has it help'd any\nhuman soul?_\" This is the hint, statement, not only of the great\nliteratus, his book, but of every great artist. It may be that all works\nof art are to be first tried by their art qualities, their image-forming\ntalent, and their dramatic, pictorial, plot-constructing, euphonious and\nother talents. Then, whenever claiming to be first-class works, they are\nto be strictly and sternly tried by their foundation in, and radiation,\nin the highest sense, and always indirectly, of the ethic principles,\nand eligibility to free, arouse, dilate.\n\nAs, within the purposes of the Kosmos, and vivifying all meteorology,\nand all the congeries of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds--all\nthe physical growth and development of man, and all the history of the\nrace in politics, religions, wars, &c., there is a moral purpose, a\nvisible or invisible intention, certainly underlying all--its results\nand proof needing to be patiently waited for--needing intuition,\nfaith, idiosyncrasy, to its realization, which many, and especially\nthe intellectual, do not have--so in the product, or congeries of\nthe product, of the greatest literatus. This is the last, profoundest\nmeasure and test of a first-class literary or esthetic achievement, and\nwhen understood and put in force must fain, I say, lead to works, books,\nnobler than any hitherto known. Lo! Nature, (the only complete, actual\npoem,) existing calmly in the divine scheme, containing all, content,\ncareless of the criticisms of a day, or these endless and wordy\nchatterers. And lo! to the consciousness of the soul, the permanent\nidentity, the thought, the something, before which the magnitude even\nof democracy, art, literature, &c., dwindles, becomes partial,\nmeasurable--something that fully satisfies, (which those do not.) That\nsomething is the All, and the idea of All, with the accompanying idea\nof eternity, and of itself, the soul, buoyant, indestructible, sailing\nspace forever, visiting every region, as a ship the sea. And again lo!\nthe pulsations in all matter, all spirit, throbbing forever--the eternal\nbeats, eternal systole and diastole of life in things--wherefrom I feel\nand know that death is not the ending, as was thought, but rather the\nreal beginning--and that nothing ever is or can be lost, nor ever die,\nnor soul, nor matter.\n\nIn the future of these States must arise poets immenser far, and make\ngreat poems of death. The poems of life are great, but there must be the\npoems of the purports of life, not only in itself, but beyond itself.\nI have eulogized Homer, the sacred bards of Jewry, Eschylus, Juvenal,\nShakspere, &c., and acknowledged their inestimable value. But,\n(with perhaps the exception, in some, not all respects, of the\nsecond-mention'd,) I say there must, for future and democratic purposes,\nappear poets, (dare I to say so?) of higher class even than any of\nthose--poets not only possess'd of the religious fire and abandon of\nIsaiah, luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer, or for proud characters\nas in Shakspere, but consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and\nconsistent with modern science. America needs, and the world needs, a\nclass of bards who will, now and ever, so link and tally the rational\nphysical being of man, with the ensembles of time and space, and with\nthis vast and multiform show, Nature, surrounding him, ever tantalizing\nhim, equally a part, and yet not a part of him, as to essentially\nharmonize, satisfy, and put at rest. Faith, very old, now scared away\nby science, must be restored, brought back by the same power that caused\nher departure--restored with new sway, deeper, wider, higher than ever.\nSurely, this universal ennui, this coward fear, this shuddering at\ndeath, these low, degrading views, are not always to rule the spirit\npervading future society, as it has the past, and does the present. What\nthe Roman Lucretius sought most nobly, yet all too blindly, negatively\nto do for his age and its successors, must be done positively by some\ngreat coming literatus, especially poet, who, while remaining fully\npoet, will absorb whatever science indicates, with spiritualism, and\nout of them, and out of his own genius, will compose the great poem\nof death. Then will man indeed confront Nature, and confront time and\nspace, both with science, and _con amore_, and take his right place,\nprepared for life, master of fortune and misfortune. And then that which\nwas long wanted will be supplied, and the ship that had it not before in\nall her voyages, will have an anchor.\n\nThere are still other standards, suggestions, for products of high\nliteratuses. That which really balances and conserves the social and\npolitical world is not so much legislation, police, treaties, and dread\nof punishment, as the latent eternal intuitional sense, in humanity,\nof fairness, manliness, decorum, &c. Indeed, this perennial regulation,\ncontrol, and oversight, by self-suppliance, is _sine qua non_ to\ndemocracy; and a highest widest aim of democratic literature may well\nbe to bring forth, cultivate, brace, and strengthen this sense, in\nindividuals and society. A strong mastership of the general inferior\nself by the superior self, is to be aided, secured, indirectly, but\nsurely, by the literatus, in his works, shaping, for individual or\naggregate democracy, a great passionate body, in and along with which\ngoes a great masterful spirit.\n\nAnd still, providing for contingencies, I fain confront the fact, the\nneed of powerful native philosophs and orators and bards, these States,\nas rallying points to come, in times of danger, and to fend off ruin\nand defection. For history is long, long, long. Shift and turn the\ncombinations of the statement as we may, the problem of the future\nof America is in certain respects as dark as it is vast. Pride,\ncompetition, segregation, vicious wilfulness, and license beyond\nexample, brood already upon us. Unwieldy and immense, who shall hold in\nbehemoth? who bridle leviathan? Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and\nover the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful,\nthreatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up\nthe thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all--brings worse\nand worse invaders--needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations\nand compellers.\n\nOur lands, embracing so much, (embracing indeed the whole, rejecting\nnone,) hold in their breast that flame also, capable of consuming\nthemselves, consuming us all. Short as the span of our national life has\nbeen, already have death and downfall crowded close upon us--and will\nagain crowd close, no doubt, even if warded off. Ages to come may never\nknow, but I know, how narrowly during the late secession war--and more\nthan once, and more than twice or thrice--our Nationality, (wherein\nbound up, as in a ship in a storm, depended, and yet depend, all our\nbest life, all hope, all value,) just grazed, just by a hair escaped\ndestruction. Alas! to think of them! the agony and bloody sweat of\ncertain of those hours! those cruel, sharp, suspended crises!\n\nEven to-day, amid these whirls, incredible flippancy, and blind fury of\nparties, infidelity, entire lack of first-class captains and leaders,\nadded to the plentiful meanness and vulgarity of the ostensible\nmasses--that problem, the labor question, beginning to open like a\nyawning gulf, rapidly widening every year--what prospect have we? We\nsail a dangerous sea of seething currents, cross and under-currents,\nvortices--all so dark, untried--and whither shall we turn? It seems\nas if the Almighty had spread before this nation charts of imperial\ndestinies, dazzling as the sun, yet with many a deep intestine\ndifficulty, and human aggregate of cankerous imperfection-saying, lo!\nthe roads, the only plans of development, long and varied with all\nterrible balks and ebullitions. You said in your soul, I will be empire\nof empires, overshadowing all else, past and present, putting\nthe history of Old-World dynasties, conquests behind me, as of no\naccount--making a new history, a history of democracy, making old\nhistory a dwarf--I alone inaugurating largeness, culminating time. If\nthese, O lands of America, are indeed the prizes, the determinations of\nyour soul, be it so. But behold the cost, and already specimens of the\ncost. Thought you greatness was to ripen for you like a pear? If you\nwould have greatness, know that you must conquer it through ages,\ncenturies--must pay for it with a proportionate price. For you too, as\nfor all lands, the struggle, the traitor, the wily person in office,\nscrofulous wealth, the surfeit of prosperity, the demonism of greed,\nthe hell of passion, the decay of faith, the long postponement, the\nfossil-like lethargy, the ceaseless need of revolutions, prophets,\nthunder-storms, deaths, births, new projections and invigorations of\nideas and men.\n\nYet I have dream'd, merged in that hidden-tangled problem of our fate,\nwhose long unraveling stretches mysteriously through time--dream'd out,\nportray'd, hinted already--a little or a larger band--a band of brave\nand true, unprecedented yet--arm'd and equipt at every point--the\nmembers separated, it may be, by different dates and States, or south,\nor north, or east, or west--Pacific, Atlantic, Southern, Canadian--a\nyear, a century here, and other centuries there--but always one, compact\nin soul, conscience-conserving, God-inculcating, inspirid achievers, not\nonly in literature, the greatest art, but achievers in all art--a new,\nundying order, dynasty, from age to age transmitted--a band, a class,\nat least as fit to cope with current years, our dangers, needs, as those\nwho, for their times, so long, so well, in armor or in cowl, upheld\nand made illustrious, that far-back feudal, priestly world. To offset\nchivalry, indeed, those vanish'd countless knights, old altars, abbeys,\npriests, ages and strings of ages, a knightlier and more sacred cause\nto-day demands, and shall supply, in a New World, to larger, grander\nwork, more than the counterpart and tally of them.\n\nArrived now, definitely, at an apex for these Vistas, I confess that\nthe promulgation and belief in such a class or institution--a new and\ngreater literatus order--its possibility, (nay certainty,) underlies\nthese entire speculations--and that the rest, the other parts, as\nsuperstructures, are all founded upon it. It really seems to me the\ncondition, not only of our future national and democratic development,\nbut of our perpetuation. In the highly artificial and materialistic\nbases of modern civilization, with the corresponding arrangements and\nmethods of living, the force-infusion of intellect alone, the depraving\ninfluences of riches just as much as poverty, the absence of all high\nideals in character--with the long series of tendencies, shapings, which\nfew are strong enough to resist, and which now seem, with steam-engine\nspeed, to be everywhere turning out the generations of humanity like\nuniform iron castings--all of which, as compared with the feudal ages,\nwe can yet do nothing better than accept, make the best of, and even\nwelcome, upon the whole, for their oceanic practical grandeur, and their\nrestless wholesale kneading of the masses--I say of all this tremendous\nand dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in\nthe United States, with the results as already seen, accumulating, and\nreaching far into the future, that they must either be confronted and\nmet by at least an equally subtle and tremendous force-infusion for\npurposes of spiritualization, for the pure conscience, for genuine\nesthetics, and for absolute and primal manliness and womanliness--or\nelse our modern civilization, with all its improvements, is in vain,\nand we are on the road to a destiny, a status, equivalent, in its real\nworld, to that of the fabled damned.\n\nProspecting thus the coming unsped days, and that new order in\nthem--marking the endless train of exercise, development, unwind, in\nnation as in man, which life is for--we see, fore-indicated, amid these\nprospects and hopes, new law-forces of spoken and written language--not\nmerely the pedagogue-forms, correct, regular, familiar with precedents,\nmade for matters of outside propriety, fine words, thoughts definitely\ntold out--but a language fann'd by the breath of Nature, which leaps\noverhead, cares mostly for impetus and effects, and for what it plants\nand invigorates to grow--tallies life and character, and seldomer tells\na thing than suggests or necessitates it. In fact, a new theory of\nliterary composition for imaginative works of the very first class, and\nespecially for highest poems, is the sole course open to these States.\nBooks are to be call'd for, and supplied, on the assumption that the\nprocess of reading is not a half-sleep, but, in highest sense, an\nexercise, a gymnast's struggle; that the reader is to do something for\nhimself, must be on the alert, must himself or herself construct indeed\nthe poem, argument, history, metaphysical essay--the text furnishing the\nhints, the clue, the start or frame-work. Not the book needs so much\nto be the complete thing, but the reader of the book does. That were\nto make a nation of supple and athletic minds, well-train'd, intuitive,\nused to depend on themselves, and not on a few coteries of writers.\n\nInvestigating here, we see, not that it is a little thing we have, in\nhaving the bequeath'd libraries, countless shelves of volumes, records,\netc.; yet how serious the danger, depending entirely on them, of the\nbloodless vein, the nerveless arm, the false application, at second or\nthird hand. We see that the real interest of this people of ours in the\ntheology, history, poetry, politics, and personal models of the past,\n(the British islands, for instance, and indeed all the past,) is not\nnecessarily to mould ourselves or our literature upon them, but to\nattain fuller, more definite comparisons, warnings, and the insight to\nourselves, our own present, and our own far grander, different, future\nhistory, religion, social customs, &c. We see that almost everything\nthat has been written, sung, or stated, of old, with reference to\nhumanity under the feudal and oriental institutes, religions, and\nfor other lands, needs to be re-written, re-sung, re-stated, in terms\nconsistent with the institution of these States, and to come in range\nand obedient uniformity with them.\n\nWe see, as in the universes of the material kosmos, after\nmeteorological, vegetable, and animal cycles, man at last arises, born\nthrough them, to prove them, concentrate them, to turn upon them with\nwonder and love--to command them, adorn them, and carry them upward\ninto superior realms--so, out of the series of the preceding social and\npolitical universes, now arise these States. We see that while many were\nsupposing things establish'd and completed, really the grandest things\nalways remain; and discover that the work of the New World is not ended,\nbut only fairly begun.\n\nWe see our land, America, her literature, esthetics, &c., as,\nsubstantially, the getting in form, or effusement and statement, of\ndeepest basic elements and loftiest final meanings, of history and\nman--and the portrayal, (under the eternal laws and conditions of\nbeauty,) of our own physiognomy, the subjective tie and expression of\nthe objective, as from our own combination, continuation, and points of\nview--and the deposit and record of the national mentality, character,\nappeals, heroism, wars, and even liberties--where these, and\nall, culminate in native literary and artistic formulation, to be\nperpetuated; and not having which native, first-class formulation, she\nwill flounder about, and her other, however imposing, eminent greatness,\nprove merely a passing gleam; but truly having which, she will\nunderstand herself, live nobly, nobly contribute, emanate, and,\nswinging, poised safely on herself, illumin'd and illuming, become a\nfull-form'd world, and divine Mother not only of material but spiritual\nworlds, in ceaseless succession through time--the main thing being the\naverage, the bodily, the concrete, the democratic, the popular, on which\nall the superstructures of the future are to permanently rest.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n[20] \"From a territorial area of less than nine hundred thousand\nsquare miles, the Union has expanded into over four millions and\na half--fifteen times larger than that of Great Britain and France\ncombined--with a shore-line, including Alaska, equal to the entire\ncircumference of the earth, and with a domain within these lines far\nwider than that of the Romans in their proudest days of conquest and\nrenown. With a river, lake, and coastwise commerce estimated at over two\nthousand millions of dollars per year; with a railway traffic of four to\nsix thousand millions per year, and the annual domestic exchanges of the\ncountry running up to nearly ten thousand millions per year; with over\ntwo thousand millions of dollars invested in manufacturing, mechanical,\nand mining industry; with over five hundred millions of acres of land\nin actual occupancy, valued, with their appurtenances, at over seven\nthousand millions of dollars, and producing annually crops valued at\nover three thousand millions of dollars; with a realm which, if the\ndensity of Belgium's population were possible, would be vast enough to\ninclude all the present inhabitants of the world; and with equal rights\nguaranteed to even the poorest and humblest of our forty millions of\npeople--we can, with a manly pride akin to that which distinguish'd the\npalmiest days of Rome, claim,\" &c., &c., &c.--_Vice-President Colfax's\nSpeech, July 4, 1870_.\n\nLATER--_London \"Times,\" (Weekly,) June 23, '82_.\n\n\"The wonderful wealth-producing power of the United States defies and\nsets at naught the grave drawbacks of a mischievous protective tariff,\nand has already obliterated, almost wholly, the traces of the greatest\nof modern civil wars. What is especially remarkable in the present\ndevelopment of American energy and success is its wide and equable\ndistribution. North and south, east and west, on the shores of the\nAtlantic and the Pacific, along the chain of the great lakes, in the\nvalley of the Mississippi, and on the coasts of the gulf of Mexico,\nthe creation of wealth and the increase of population are signally\nexhibited. It is quite true, as has been shown by the recent\napportionment of population in the House of Representatives, that some\nsections of the Union have advanced, relatively to the rest, in an\nextraordinary and unexpected degree. But this does not imply that the\nStates which have gain'd no additional representatives or have actually\nlost some have been stationary or have receded. The fact is that the\npresent tide of prosperity has risen so high that it has overflow' d all\nbarriers, and has fill'd up the back-waters, and establish'd something\nlike an approach to uniform success.\"\n\n[21] See, for hereditaments, specimens, Walter Scott's Border\nMinstrelsy, Percy's collection, Ellis's early English Metrical\nRomances, the European continental poems of Walter of Aquitania, and the\nNibelungen, of pagan stock, but monkish-feudal redaction; the history of\nthe Troubadours, by Fauriel; even the far-back cumbrous old Hindu epics,\nas indicating the Asian eggs out of which European chivalry was hatch'd;\nTicknor's chapters on the Cid, and on the Spanish poems and poets of\nCalderon's time. Then always, and, of course, as the superbest poetic\nculmination-expression of feudalism, the Shaksperean dramas, in\nthe attitudes, dialogue, characters, &c., of the princes, lords and\ngentlemen, the pervading atmosphere, the implied and express'd standard\nof manners, the high port and proud stomach, the regal embroidery of\nstyle, &c.\n\n[22] Of these rapidly-sketch'd hiatuses, the two which seem to me most\nserious are, for one, the condition, absence, or perhaps the singular\nabeyance, of moral conscientious fibre all through American society;\nand, for another, the appaling depletion of women in their powers of\nsane athletic maternity, their crowning attribute, and ever making the\nwoman, in loftiest spheres, superior to the man.\n\nI have sometimes thought, indeed, that the sole avenue and means of a\nreconstructed sociology depended, primarily, on a new birth, elevation,\nexpansion, invigoration of woman, affording, for races to come, (as the\nconditions that antedate birth are indispensable,) a perfect motherhood.\nGreat, great, indeed, far greater than they know, is the sphere of\nwomen. But doubtless the question of such new sociology all goes\ntogether, includes many varied and complex influences and premises, and\nthe man as well as the woman, and the woman as well as the man.\n\n[23] The question hinted here is one which time only can answer. Must\nnot the virtue of modern Individualism, continually enlarging, usurping\nall, seriously affect, perhaps keep down entirely, in America, the like\nof the ancient virtue of Patriotism, the fervid and absorbing love of\ngeneral country? I have no doubt myself that the two will merge, and\nwill mutually profit and brace each other, and that from them a greater\nproduct, a third, will arise. But I feel that at present they and their\noppositions form a serious problem and paradox in the United States.\n\n[24] \"SHOOTING NIAGARA.\"--I was at first roused to much anger and\nabuse by this essay from Mr. Carlyle, so insulting to the theory of\nAmerica--but happening to think afterwards how I had more than once been\nin the like mood, during which his essay was evidently cast, and seen\npersons and things in the same light, (indeed some might say there are\nsigns of the same feeling in these Vistas)--I have since read it again,\nnot only as a study, expressing as it does certain judgments from the\nhighest feudal point of view, but have read it with respect as coming\nfrom an earnest soul, and as contributing certain sharp-cutting metallic\ngrains, which, if not gold or silver, may be good, hard, honest iron.\n\n[25] For fear of mistake, I may as well distinctly specify, as\ncheerfully included in the model and standard of these Vistas,\na practical, stirring, worldly, money-making, even materialistic\ncharacter. It is undeniable that our farms, stores, offices, dry-goods,\ncoal and groceries, enginery, cash-accounts, trades, earnings, markets,\n&c., should be attended to in earnest, and actively pursued, just as\nif they had a real and permanent existence. I perceive clearly that the\nextreme business energy, and this almost maniacal appetite for wealth\nprevalent in the United States, are parts of amelioration and progress,\nindispensably needed to prepare the very results I demand. My theory\nincludes riches, and the getting of riches, and the amplest products,\npower, activity, inventions, movements, &c. Upon them, as upon\nsubstrata, I raise the edifice design'd in these Vistas.\n\n[26] The whole present system of the officering and personnel of the\narmy and navy of these States, and the spirit and letter of their\ntrebly-aristocratic rules and regulations, is a monstrous exotic, a\nnuisance and revolt, and belong here just as much as orders of nobility,\nor the Pope's council of cardinals. I say if the present theory of\nour army and navy is sensible and true, then the rest of America is an\nunmitigated fraud.\n\n[27] A: After the rest is satiated, all interest culminates in the field\nof persons, and never flags there. Accordingly in this field have the\ngreat poets and literatuses signally toil'd. They too, in all ages, all\nlands, have been creators, fashioning, making types of men and women,\nas Adam and Eve are made in the divine fable. Behold, shaped, bred by\norientalism, feudalism, through their long growth and culmination, and\nbreeding back in return--(when shall we have an equal series, typical of\ndemocracy?)--behold, commencing in primal Asia, (apparently formulated,\nin what beginning we know, in the gods of the mythologies, and coming\ndown thence,) a few samples out of the countless product, bequeath'd to\nthe moderns, bequeath'd to America as studies. For the men, Yudishtura,\nRama, Arjuna, Solomon, most of the Old and New Testament characters;\nAchilles, Ulysses, Theseus, Prometheus, Hercules, Aeneas, Plutarch's\nheroes; the Merlin of Celtic bards; the Cid, Arthur and his knights,\nSiegfried and Hagen in the Nibelungen; Roland and Oliver; Roustam in\nthe Shah-Nemah; and so on to Milton's Satan, Cervantes' Don Quixote,\nShakspere's Hamlet, Richard II., Lear, Marc Antony, &c., and the modern\nFaust. These, I say, are models, combined, adjusted to other standards\nthan America's, but of priceless value to her and hers.\n\nAmong women, the goddesses of the Egyptian, Indian and Greek\nmythologies, certain Bible characters, especially the Holy Mother;\nCleopatra, Penelope; the portraits of Brunhelde and Chriemhilde in the\nNibelungen; Oriana, Una, &c.; the modern Consuelo, Walter Scott's Jeanie\nand Effie Deans, &c., &c. (Yet woman portray'd or outlin'd at her best,\nor as perfect human mother, does not hitherto, it seems to me, fully\nappear in literature.)\n\n[28] Note, to-day, an instructive, curious spectacle and conflict.\nScience, (twin in its fields, of Democracy in its)--Science, testing\nabsolutely all thoughts, all works, has already burst well upon the\nworld--a sun, mounting, most illuminating, most glorious--surely never\nagain to set. But against it, deeply entrench'd, holding possession, yet\nremains, (not only through the churches and schools, but by imaginative\nliterature, and unregenerate poetry,) the fossil theology of\nthe mythic-materialistic, superstitious, untaught and credulous,\nfable-loving, primitive ages of humanity.\n\n[29] It is to the development, identification, and general prevalence\nof that fervid comradeship, (the adhesive love, at least rivaling the\namative love hitherto possessing imaginative literature, if not going\nbeyond it,) that I look for the counterbalance and offset of\nour materialistic and vulgar American democracy, and for the\nspiritualization thereof. Many will say it is a dream, and will not\nfollow my inferences: but I confidently expect a time when there will\nbe seen, running like a half-hid warp through all the myriad audible and\nvisible worldly interests of America, threads of manly friendship, fond\nand loving, pure and sweet, strong and life-long, carried to degrees\nhitherto unknown--not only giving tone to individual character, and\nmaking it unprecedently emotional, muscular, heroic, and refined, but\nhaving the deepest relations to general politics. I say democracy infers\nsuch loving comradeship, as its most inevitable twin or counterpart,\nwithout which it will be incomplete, in vain, and incapable of\nperpetuating itself.\n\n[30] I am reminded as I write that out of this very conscience, or idea\nof conscience, of intense moral right, and in its name and strain'd\nconstruction, the worst fanaticisms, wars, persecutions, murders, &c.,\nhave yet, in all lands, in the past, been broach'd, and have come to\ntheir devilish fruition. Much is to be said--but I may say here, and\nin response, that side by side with the unflagging stimulation of the\nelements of religion and conscience must henceforth move with\nequal sway, science, absolute reason, and the general proportionate\ndevelopment of the whole man. These scientific facts, deductions, are\ndivine too--precious counted parts of moral civilization, and, with\nphysical health, indispensable to it, to prevent fanaticism. For\nabstract religion, I perceive, is easily led astray, ever credulous, and\nis capable of devouring, remorseless, like fire and flame. Conscience,\ntoo, isolated from all else, and from the emotional nature, may but\nattain the beauty and purity of glacial, snowy ice. We want, for these\nStates, for the general character, a cheerful, religious fervor, endued\nwith the ever-present modifications of the human emotions, friendship,\nbenevolence, with a fair field for scientific inquiry, the right of\nindividual judgment, and always the cooling influences of material\nNature.\n\n[31] The culmination and fruit of literary artistic expression, and\nits final fields of pleasure for the human soul, are in metaphysics,\nincluding the mysteries of the spiritual world, the soul itself, and the\nquestion of the immortal continuation of our identity. In all ages, the\nmind of man has brought up here--and always will. Here, at least, of\nwhatever race or era, we stand on common ground. Applause, too, is\nunanimous, antique or modern. Those authors who work well in this\nfield--though their reward, instead of a handsome percentage, or\nroyalty, may be but simply the laurel-crown of the victors in the great\nOlympic games--will be dearest to humanity, and their works, however\nesthetically defective, will be treasur'd forever. The altitude of\nliterature and poetry has always been religion--and always will be. The\nIndian Vedas, the Nackas of Zoroaster, the Tal mud of the Jews, the Old\nTestament, the Gospel of Christ and his disciples, Plato's works, the\nKoran of Mohammed, the Edda of Snorro, and so on toward our own day, to\nSwedenborg, and to the invaluable contributions of Leibnitz, Kant and\nHegel--these, with such poems only in which, (while singing well\nof persons and events, of the passions of man, and the shows of the\nmaterial universe,) the religious tone, the consciousness of mystery,\nthe recognition of the future, of the unknown, of Deity over and under\nall, and of the divine purpose, are never absent, but indirectly give\ntone to all--exhibit literature's real heights and elevations, towering\nup like the great mountains of the earth.\n\nStanding on this ground--the last, the highest, only permanent\nground--and sternly criticising, from it, all works, either of the\nliterary, or any art, we have peremptorily to dismiss every pretensive\nproduction, however fine its esthetic or intellectual points, which\nviolates or ignores, or even does not celebrate, the central divine\nidea of All, suffusing universe, of eternal trains of purpose, in\nthe development, by however slow degrees, of the physical, moral, and\nspiritual kosmos. I say he has studied, meditated to no profit,\nwhatever may be his mere erudition, who has not absorbed this simple\nconsciousness and faith. It is not entirely new--but it is for Democracy\nto elaborate it, and look to build upon and expand from it, with\nuncompromising reliance. Above the doors of teaching the inscription is\nto appear, Though little or nothing can be absolutely known, perceiv'd,\nexcept from a point of view which is evanescent, yet we know at least\none permanency, that Time and Space, in the will of God, furnish\nsuccessive chains, completions of material births and beginnings,\nsolve all discrepancies, fears and doubts, and eventually fulfil\nhappiness--and that the prophecy of those births, namely spiritual\nresults, throws the true arch over all teaching, all science. The local\nconsiderations of sin, disease, deformity, ignorance, death, &c., and\ntheir measurement by the superficial mind, and ordinary legislation and\ntheology, are to be met by science, boldly accepting, promulging this\nfaith, and planting the seeds of superber laws--of the explication of\nthe physical universe through the spiritual--and clearing the way for a\nreligion, sweet and unimpugnable alike to little child or great savan.\n\n\n\n\nORIGINS OF ATTEMPTED SECESSION\n\n_Not the whole matter, but some side facts worth conning to-day and any\nday_.\n\nI consider the war of attempted secession, 1860-'65, not as a struggle\nof two distinct and separate peoples, but a conflict (often happening,\nand very fierce) between the passions and paradoxes of one and the same\nidentity--perhaps the only terms on which that identity could really\nbecome fused, homogeneous and lasting. The origin and conditions out\nof which it arose, are full of lessons, full of warnings yet to the\nRepublic--and always will be. The underlying and principal of those\norigins are yet singularly ignored. The Northern States were really\njust as responsible for that war, (in its precedents, foundations,\ninstigations,) as the South. Let me try to give my view. From the age of\n21 to 40, (1840-'60,) I was interested in the political movements of the\nland, not so much as a participant, but as an observer, and a regular\nvoter at the elections. I think I was conversant with the springs of\naction, and their workings, not only in New York city and Brooklyn,\nbut understood them in the whole country, as I had made leisurely tours\nthrough all the middle States, and partially through the western and\nsouthern, and down to New Orleans, in which city I resided for some\ntime. (I was there at the close of the Mexican war--saw and talk'd with\nGeneral Taylor, and the other generals and officers, who were feted and\ndetain'd several days on their return victorious from that expedition.)\n\nOf course many and very contradictory things, specialties, developments,\nconstitutional views, &c., went to make up the origin of the war--but\nthe most significant general fact can be best indicated and stated as\nfollows: For twenty-five years previous to the outbreak, the controling\n\"Democratic\" nominating conventions of our Republic--starting from their\nprimaries in wards or districts, and so expanding to counties,\npowerful cities, States, and to the great Presidential nominating\nconventions--were getting to represent and be composed of more and more\nputrid and dangerous materials. Let me give a schedule, or list, of\none of these representative conventions for a long time before, and\ninclusive of, that which nominated Buchanan. (Remember they had come to\nbe the fountains and tissues of the American body politic, forming, as\nit were, the whole blood, legislation, office-holding, &c.) One of these\nconventions, from 1840 to '60, exhibited a spectacle such as could\nnever be seen except in our own age and in these States. The members who\ncomposed it were, seven-eighths of them, the meanest kind of bawling and\nblowing office-holders, office-seekers, pimps, malignants, conspirators,\nmurderers, fancy-men, custom-house clerks, contractors, kept-editors,\nspaniels well-train'd to carry and fetch, jobbers, infidels,\ndisunionists, terrorists, mail-riflers, slave-catchers, pushers of\nslavery, creatures of the President, creatures of would-be Presidents,\nspies, bribers, compromisers, lobbyers, sponges, ruin'd sports,\nexpell'd gamblers, policy-backers, monte-dealers, duellists, carriers\nof conceal'd weapons, deaf men, pimpled men, scarr'd inside with vile\ndisease, gaudy outside with gold chains made from the people's money\nand harlots' money twisted together; crawling, serpentine men, the lousy\ncombings and born freedom-sellers of the earth. And whence came they?\nFrom back-yards and bar-rooms; from out of the custom-houses, marshals'\noffices, post-offices, and gambling-hells; from the President's house,\nthe jail, the station-house; from unnamed by-places, where devilish\ndisunion was hatch'd at midnight; from political hearses, and from the\ncoffins inside, and from the shrouds inside of the coffins; from the\ntumors and abscesses of the land; from the skeletons and skulls in the\nvaults of the federal almshouses; and from the running sores of the\ngreat cities. Such, I say, form'd, or absolutely controll'd the forming\nof, the entire personnel, the atmosphere, nutriment and chyle, of our\nmunicipal, State, and National politics--substantially permeating,\nhandling, deciding, and wielding everything--legislation, nominations,\nelections, \"public sentiment,\" &c.--while the great masses of the\npeople, farmers, mechanics, and traders, were helpless in their gripe.\nThese conditions were mostly prevalent in the north and west, and\nespecially in New York and Philadelphia cities; and the southern\nleaders, (bad enough, but of a far higher order,) struck hands and\naffiliated with, and used them. Is it strange that a thunder-storm\nfollow'd such morbid and stifling cloud-strata?\n\nI say then, that what, as just outlined, heralded, and made the ground\nready for secession revolt, ought to be held up, through all the future,\nas the most instructive lesson in American political history--the most\nsignificant warning and beacon-light to coming generations. I say\nthat the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth terms of the American\nPresidency have shown that the villainy and shallowness of rulers\n(back'd by the machinery of great parties) are just as eligible to these\nStates as to any foreign despotism, kingdom, or empire--there is not a\nbit of difference. History is to record those three Presidentiads, and\nespecially the administrations of Fillmore and Buchanan, as so far our\ntopmost warning and shame. Never were publicly display'd more deform'd,\nmediocre, snivelling, unreliable, false-hearted men. Never were these\nStates so insulted, and attempted to be betray'd. All the main purposes\nfor which the government was establish'd were openly denied. The\nperfect equality of slavery with freedom was flauntingly preach'd in the\nnorth--nay, the superiority of slavery. The slave trade was proposed\nto be renew'd. Everywhere frowns and misunderstandings--everywhere\nexasperations and humiliations. (The slavery contest is settled--and the\nwar is long over--yet do not those putrid conditions, too many of them,\nstill exist? still result in diseases, fevers, wounds--not of war and\narmy hospitals--but the wounds and diseases of peace?)\n\nOut of those generic influences, mainly in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\n&c., arose the attempt at disunion. To philosophical examination,\nthe malignant fever of that war shows its embryonic sources, and\nthe original nourishment of its life and growth, in the north. I say\nsecession, below the surface, originated and was brought to maturity\nin the free States. I allude to the score of years preceding 1860. My\ndeliberate opinion is now, that if at the opening of the contest\nthe abstract duality-question of _slavery and quiet_ could have been\nsubmitted to a direct popular vote, as against their opposite, they\nwould have triumphantly carried the day in a majority of the northern\nStates--in the large cities, leading off with New York and Philadelphia,\nby tremendous majorities. The events of '61 amazed everybody north and\nsouth, and burst all prophecies and calculations like bubbles. But even\nthen, and during the whole war, the stern fact remains that (not only\ndid the north put it down, but) _the secession cause had numerically\njust as many sympathizers in the free as in the rebel States_.\n\nAs to slavery, abstractly and practically, (its idea, and the\ndetermination to establish and expand it, especially in the new\nterritories, the future America,) it is too common, I repeat, to\nidentify it exclusively with the south. In fact down to the opening of\nthe war, the whole country had about an equal hand in it. The north had\nat least been just as guilty, if not more guilty; and the east and west\nhad. The former Presidents and Congresses had been guilty--the governors\nand legislatures of every northern State had been guilty, and the mayors\nof New York and other northern cities had all been guilty--their hands\nwere all stain'd. And as the conflict took decided shape, it is hard\nto tell which class, the leading southern or northern disunionists,\nwas more stunn'd and disappointed at the non-action of the free-State\nsecession element, so largely existing and counted on by those leaders,\nboth sections.\n\nSo much for that point, and for the north. As to the inception and\ndirect instigation of the war, in the south itself, I shall not attempt\ninteriors or complications. Behind all, the idea that it was from\na resolute and arrogant determination on the part of the extreme\nslaveholders, the Calhounites, to carry the States-rights' portion\nof the constitutional compact to its farthest verge, and nationalize\nslavery, or else disrupt the Union, and found a new empire, with slavery\nfor its corner-stone, was and is undoubtedly the true theory. (If\nsuccessful, this attempt might--I am not sure, but it might--have\ndestroy'd not only our American republic, in anything like first-class\nproportions, in itself and its prestige, but for ages at least, the\ncause of Liberty and Equality everywhere--and would have been the\ngreatest triumph of reaction, and the severest blow to political and\nevery other freedom, possible to conceive. Its worst result would have\ninured to the southern States themselves.) That our national democratic\nexperiment, principle, and machinery, could triumphantly sustain such a\nshock, and that the Constitution could weather it, like a ship a storm,\nand come out of it as sound and whole as before, is by far the most\nsignal proof yet of the stability of that experiment, Democracy, and of\nthose principles, and that Constitution.\n\nOf the war itself, we know in the ostent what has been done. The numbers\nof the dead and wounded can be told or approximated, the debt posted and\nput on record, the material events narrated, &c. Meantime, elections go\non, laws are pass'd, political parties struggle, issue their platforms,\n&c., just the same as before. But immensest results, not only in\npolitics, but in literature, poems, and sociology, are doubtless waiting\nyet unform'd in the future. How long they will wait I cannot tell.\nThe pageant of history's retrospect shows us, ages since, all Europe\nmarching on the crusades, those arm'd uprisings of the people, stirr'd\nby a mere idea, to grandest attempt--and, when once baffled in it,\nreturning, at intervals, twice, thrice, and again. An unsurpass'd series\nof revolutionary events, influences. Yet it took over two hundred years\nfor the seeds of the crusades to germinate, before beginning even to\nsprout. Two hundred years they lay, sleeping, not dead, but dormant in\nthe ground. Then, out of them, unerringly, arts, travel, navigation,\npolitics, literature, freedom, the spirit of adventure, inquiry, all\narose, grew, and steadily sped on to what we see at present. Far\nback there, that huge agitation-struggle of the crusades stands,\nas undoubtedly the embryo, the start, of the high preeminence of\nexperiment, civilization and enterprise which the European nations have\nsince sustain'd, and of which these States are the heirs.\n\nAnother illustration--(history is full of them, although the war itself,\nthe victory of the Union, and the relations of our equal States, present\nfeatures of which there are no precedents in the past.) The conquest of\nEngland eight centuries ago, by the Franco-Normans--the obliteration of\nthe old, (in many respects so needing obliteration)--the Domesday Book,\nand the repartition of the land--the old impedimenta removed, even by\nblood and ruthless violence, and a new, progressive genesis establish'd,\nnew seeds sown--time has proved plain enough that, bitter as they\nwere, all these were the most salutary series of revolutions that could\npossibly have happen'd. Out of them, and by them mainly, have come,\nout of Albic, Roman and Saxon England--and without them could not have\ncome--not only the England of the 500 years down to the present, and of\nthe present--but these States. Nor, except for that terrible dislocation\nand overturn, would these States, as they are, exist to-day.\n\nIt is certain to me that the United States, by virtue of that war and\nits results, and through that and them only, are now ready to enter, and\nmust certainly enter, upon their genuine career in history, as no more\ntorn and divided in their spinal requisites, but a great homogeneous\nNation--free States all--a moral and political unity in variety, such\nas Nature shows in her grandest physical works, and as much greater than\nany mere work of Nature, as the moral and political, the work of man,\nhis mind, his soul, are, in their loftiest sense, greater than the\nmerely physical. Out of that war not only has the nationality of the\nStates escaped from being strangled, but more than any of the rest, and,\nin my opinion, more than the north itself, the vital heart and breath of\nthe south have escaped as from the pressure of a general nightmare,\nand are henceforth to enter on a life, development, and active freedom,\nwhose realities are certain in the future, notwithstanding all the\nsouthern vexations of the hour--a development which could not possibly\nhave been achiev'd on any less terms, or by any other means than that\ngrim lesson, or something equivalent to it. And I predict that the south\nis yet to outstrip the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACES TO \"LEAVES OF GRASS\"\n\n\nPREFACE, 1855 To first issue of Leaves of Grass. _Brooklyn, N.Y._\n\nAmerica does not repel the past, or what the past has produced under\nits forms, or amid other politics, or the idea of castes, or the old\nreligions--accepts the lesson with calmness--is not impatient because\nthe slough still sticks to opinions and manners in literature, while the\nlife which served its requirements has passed into the new life of the\nnew forms--perceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating and\nsleeping rooms of the house--perceives that it waits a little while\nin the door--that it was fittest for its days--that its action has\ndescended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches--and that\nhe shall be fittest for his days.\n\nThe Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth, have\nprobably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are\nessentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto,\nthe largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler\nlargeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that\ncorresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here\nis action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and\ndetails, magnificently moving in masses. Here is the hospitality which\nfor ever indicates heroes. Here the performance, disdaining the trivial,\nunapproach'd in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings, and\nthe push of its perspective, spreads with crampless and flowing breadth,\nand showers its prolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must\nindeed own the riches of the summer and winter, and need never be\nbankrupt while corn grows from the ground, or the orchards drop apples,\nor the bays contain fish, or men beget children upon women.\n\nOther states indicate themselves in their deputies--but the genius of\nthe United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures,\nnor in its ambassadors or authors, or colleges or churches or parlors,\nnor even in its newspapers or inventors--but always most in the common\npeople, south, north, west, east, in all its States, through all its\nmighty amplitude. The largeness of the nation, however, were monstrous\nwithout a corresponding largeness and generosity of the spirit of the\ncitizen. Not swarming states, nor streets and steamships, nor prosperous\nbusiness, nor farms, nor capital, nor learning, may suffice for the\nideal of man--nor suffice the poet. No reminiscences may suffice\neither. A live nation can always cut a deep mark, and can have the best\nauthority the cheapest--namely, from its own soul. This is the sum of\nthe profitable uses of individuals or states, and of present action and\ngrandeur, and of the subjects of poets. (As if it were necessary to\ntrot back generation after generation to the eastern records! As if the\nbeauty and sacredness of the demonstrable must fall behind that of the\nmythical! As if men do not make their mark out of any times! As if the\nopening of the western continent by discovery, and what has transpired\nin North and South America, were less than the small theatre of the\nantique, or the aimless sleep-walking of the middle ages!) The pride of\nthe United States leaves the wealth and finesse of the cities, and all\nreturns of commerce and agriculture, and all the magnitude of geography\nor shows of exterior victory, to enjoy the sight and realization of\nfull-sized men, or one full-sized man unconquerable and simple. The\nAmerican poets are to enclose old and new, for America is the race of\nraces. The expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and\nnew. It is to be indirect, and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its\nquality goes through these to much more. Let the age and wars of other\nnations be chanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and\nthat finish the verse. Not so the great psalm of the republic. Here\nthe theme is creative, and has vista. Whatever stagnates in the flat\nof custom or obedience or legislation, the great poet never stagnates.\nObedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of reach\nhe stands, turning a concentrated light--he turns the pivot with\nhis finger--he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands, and easily\novertakes and envelopes them. The time straying toward infidelity and\nconfections and persiflage he withholds by steady faith. Faith is the\nantiseptic of the soul--it pervades the common people and preserves\nthem--they never give up believing and expecting and trusting. There\nis that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate\nperson, that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive\ngenius. The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be\njust as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist.\n\nThe power to destroy or remould is freely used by the greatest poet, but\nseldom the power of attack. What is past is past. If he does not expose\nsuperior models, and prove himself by every step he takes, he is not\nwhat is wanted. The presence of the great poet conquers--not parleying,\nor struggling, or any prepared attempts. Now he has passed that way, see\nafter him! There is not left any vestige of despair, or misanthropy, or\ncunning, or exclusiveness, or the ignominy of a nativity or color, or\ndelusion of hell or the necessity of hell--and no man thenceforward\nshall be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin. The greatest poet\nhardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into anything that\nwas before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the\nuniverse. He is a seer--he is individual--he is complete in himself--the\nothers are as good as he, only he sees it, and they do not. He is\nnot one of the chorus--he does not stop for any regulation--he is the\npresident of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest, he does\nto the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other\nsenses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but\nits own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A\nsingle glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all\nthe instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What\nis marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible or baseless or\nvague--after you have once just open'd the space of a peach-pit, and\ngiven audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things\nenter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion or\njostling or jam?\n\nThe land and sea, the animals, fishes and birds, the sky of heaven and\nthe orbs, the forests, mountains and rivers, are not small themes--but\nfolks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity\nwhich always attach to dumb real objects--they expect him to indicate\nthe path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the\nbeauty well enough--probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of\nhunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and\nfields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons,\ndrivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old\nvaried sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence\nof the poetic in out-door people. They can never be assisted by poets\nto perceive--some may, but they never can. The poetic quality is not\nmarshal'd in rhyme or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor\nin melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these\nand much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops\nseeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it\nconveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme\nand uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws,\nand bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a\nbush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges,\nand melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The\nfluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or\nrecitations, are not independent but dependent. All beauty comes\nfrom beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are\nin conjunction in a man or woman, it is enough--the fact will prevail\nthrough the universe; but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will\nnot prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is\nlost. This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals,\ndespise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the\nstupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants,\nargue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the\npeople, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown, or to any man or\nnumber of men--go freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the\nyoung, and with the mothers of families--re-examine all you have been\ntold in school or church or in any book, and dismiss whatever insults\nyour own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the\nrichest fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its\nlips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and in every motion\nand joint of your body. The poet shall not spend his time in unneeded\nwork. He shall know that the ground is already plough'd and manured;\nothers may not know it, but he shall. He shall go directly to the\ncreation. His trust shall master the trust of everything he touches--and\nshall master all attachment.\n\nThe known universe has one complete lover, and that is the greatest\npoet. He consumes an eternal passion, and is indifferent which chance\nhappens, and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune, and\npersuades daily and hourly his delicious pay. What balks or breaks\nothers is fuel for his burning progress to contact and amorous joy.\nOther proportions of the reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his\nproportions. All expected from heaven or from the highest, he is rapport\nwith in the sight of the daybreak, or the scenes of the winter woods,\nor the presence of children playing, or with his arm round the neck of a\nman or woman. His love above all love has leisure and expanse--he leaves\nroom ahead of himself. He is no irresolute or suspicious lover--he is\nsure--he scorns intervals. His experience and the showers and thrills\nare not for nothing. Nothing can jar him--suffering and darkness\ncannot--death and fear cannot. To him complaint and jealousy and envy\nare corpses buried and rotten in the earth--he saw them buried. The\nsea is not surer of the shore, or the shore of the sea, than he is the\nfruition of his love, and of all perfection and beauty.\n\nThe fruition of beauty is no chance of miss or hit--it is as inevitable\nas life--it is exact and plumb as gravitation. From the eyesight\nproceeds another eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another\nhearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of\nthe harmony of things with man. These understand the law of perfection\nin masses and floods--that it is profuse and impartial--that there is\nnot a minute of the light or dark, nor an acre of the earth and sea,\nwithout it--nor any direction of the sky, nor any trade or employment,\nnor any turn of events. This is the reason that about the proper\nexpression of beauty there is precision and balance. One part does not\nneed to be thrust above another. The best singer is not the one who has\nthe most lithe and powerful organ. The pleasure of poems is not in them\nthat take the handsomest measure and sound.\n\nWithout effort, and without exposing in the least how it is done, the\ngreatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and\nscenes and persons, some more and some less, to bear on your individual\ncharacter as you hear or read. To do this well is to compete with the\nlaws that pursue and follow Time. What is the purpose must surely be\nthere, and the clue of it must be there--and the faintest indication is\nthe indication of the best, and then becomes the clearest indication.\nPast and present and future are not disjoin'd but join'd. The greatest\npoet forms the consistence of what is to be, from what has been and is.\nHe drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their\nfeet. He says to the past, Rise and walk before me that I may realize\nyou. He learns the lesson--he places himself where the future becomes\npresent. The greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays over character\nand scenes and passions--he finally ascends, and finishes all--he\nexhibits the pinnacles that no man can tell what they are for, or\nwhat is beyond--he glows a moment on the extremest verge. He is most\nwonderful in his last half-hidden smile or frown; by that flash of the\nmoment of parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terrified\nafterward for many years. The greatest poet does not moralize or make\napplications of morals--he knows the soul. The soul has that measureless\npride which consists in never acknowledging any lessons or deductions\nbut its own. But it has sympathy as measureless as its pride, and\nthe one balances the other, and neither can stretch too far while it\nstretches in company with the other. The inmost secrets of art sleep\nwith the twain. The greatest poet has lain close betwixt both, and they\nare vital in his style and thoughts.\n\nThe art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of\nletters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity--nothing can\nmake up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the\nheave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects\ntheir articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But\nto speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of\nthe movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of\ntrees in the woods and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph\nof art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd\non one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You\nshall not contemplate the flight of the gray gull over the bay, or the\nmettlesome action of the blood horse, or the tall leaning of sunflowers\non their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven,\nor the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than\nyou shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a mark'd style,\nand is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or\ndiminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I\nwill not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or\neffect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like\ncurtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains.\nWhat I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt or\nstartle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat\nor snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or\nportray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition.\nYou shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.\n\nThe old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved\nby their unconstraint. A heroic person walks at his ease through and\nout of that custom or precedent or authority that suits him not. Of the\ntraits of the brotherhood of first-class writers, savans, musicians,\ninventors and artists, nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing\nfrom new free forms. In the need of poems, philosophy, politics,\nmechanism, science, behavior, the craft of art, an appropriate native\ngrand opera, shipcraft, or any craft, he is greatest for ever and ever\nwho contributes the greatest original practical example. The cleanest\nexpression is that which finds no sphere worthy of itself, and makes\none.\n\nThe messages of great poems to each man and woman are, Come to us on\nequal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than\nyou, what we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did\nyou suppose there could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be\nunnumber'd Supremes, and that one does not countervail another any more\nthan one eyesight countervails another--and that men can be good or\ngrand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them. What\ndo you think is the grandeur of storms and dismemberments, and the\ndeadliest battles and wrecks, and the wildest fury of the elements, and\nthe power of the sea, and the motion of Nature, and the throes of human\ndesires, and dignity and hate and love? It is that something in the\nsoul which says, Rage on, whirl on, I tread master here and\neverywhere--Master of the spasms of the sky and of the shatter of the\nsea, Master of nature and passion and death, and of all terror and all\npain.\n\nThe American bards shall be mark'd for generosity and affection, and\nfor encouraging competitors. They shall be Kosmos, without monopoly or\nsecrecy, glad to pass anything to any one--hungry for equals night and\nday. They shall not be careful of riches and privilege--they shall be\nriches and privilege--they shall perceive who the most affluent man\nis. The most affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees\nby equivalents out of the stronger wealth of himself. The American bard\nshall delineate no class of persons, nor one or two out of the strata of\ninterests, nor love most nor truth most, nor the soul most, nor the body\nmost--and not be for the Eastern States more than the Western, or the\nNorthern States more than the Southern.\n\nExact science and its practical movements are no checks on the\ngreatest poet, but always his encouragement and support. The outset and\nremembrance are there--there the arms that lifted him first, and braced\nhim best--there he returns after all his goings and comings. The\nsailor and traveler--the anatomist, chemist, astronomer, geologist,\nphrenologist, spiritualist, mathematician, historian, and lexicographer,\nare not poets, but they are the lawgivers of poets, and their\nconstruction underlies the structure of every perfect poem. No matter\nwhat rises or is utter'd, they sent the seed of the conception of it--of\nthem and by them stand the visible proofs of souls. If there shall be\nlove and content between the father and the son, and if the greatness\nof the son is the exuding of the greatness of the father, there shall be\nlove between the poet and the man of demonstrable science. In the beauty\nof poems are henceforth the tuft and final applause of science.\n\nGreat is the faith of the flush of knowledge, and of the investigation\nof the depths of qualities and things. Cleaving and circling here swells\nthe soul of the poet, yet is president of itself always. The depths\nare fathomless, and therefore calm. The innocence and nakedness are\nresumed--they are neither modest nor immodest. The whole theory of\nthe supernatural, and all that was twined with it or educed out of it,\ndeparts as a dream. What has ever happen'd--what happens, and whatever\nmay or shall happen, the vital laws inclose all. They are sufficient for\nany case and for all cases--none to be hurried or retarded--any special\nmiracle of affairs or persons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme\nwhere every motion and every spear of grass, and the frames and spirits\nof men and women and all that concerns them, are unspeakably perfect\nmiracles, all referring to all, and each distinct and in its place. It\nis also not consistent with the reality of the soul to admit that there\nis anything in the known universe more divine than men and women.\n\nMen and women, and the earth and all upon it, are to be taken as they\nare, and the investigation of their past and present and future shall\nbe unintermitted, and shall be done with perfect candor. Upon this basis\nphilosophy speculates, ever looking towards the poet, ever regarding the\neternal tendencies of all toward happiness, never inconsistent with what\nis clear to the senses and to the soul. For the eternal tendencies of\nall toward happiness make the only point of sane philosophy. Whatever\ncomprehends less than that--whatever is less than the laws of light and\nof astronomical motion--or less than the laws that follow the thief,\nthe liar, the glutton and the drunkard, through this life and doubtless\nafterward--or less than vast stretches of time, or the slow formation of\ndensity, or the patient upheaving of strata--is of no account. Whatever\nwould put God in a poem or system of philosophy as contending against\nsome being or influence, is also of no account. Sanity and ensemble\ncharacterize the great master--spoilt in one principle, all is spoilt.\nThe great master has nothing to do with miracles. He sees health\nfor himself in being one of the mass--he sees the hiatus in singular\neminence. To the perfect shape comes common ground. To be under the\ngeneral law is great, for that is to correspond with it. The master\nknows that he is unspeakably great, and that all are unspeakably\ngreat--that nothing, for instance, is greater than to conceive children,\nand bring them up well--that to _be_ is just as great as to perceive or\ntell.\n\nIn the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is\nindispensable. Liberty takes the adherence of heroes wherever man and\nwoman exist--but never takes any adherence or welcome from the rest more\nthan from poets. They are the voice and exposition of liberty. They out\nof ages are worthy the grand idea--to them it is confided, and they\nmust sustain it. Nothing has precedence of it, and nothing can warp or\ndegrade it.\n\nAs the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real\nbody, and in the pleasure of things, they possess the superiority of\ngenuineness over all fiction and romance. As they emit themselves, facts\nare shower'd over with light--the daylight is lit with more volatile\nlight--the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many\nfold. Each precise object or condition or combination or process\nexhibits a beauty--the multiplication table its--old age its--the\ncarpenter's trade its--the grand opera its--the huge-hull'd clean-shap'd\nNew York clipper at sea under steam or full sail gleams with unmatch'd\nbeauty--the American circles and large harmonies of government gleam\nwith theirs--and the commonest definite intentions and actions with\ntheirs. The poets of the kosmos advance through all interpositions and\ncoverings and turmoils and stratagems to first principles. They are of\nuse--they dissolve poverty from its need, and riches from its conceit.\nYou large proprietor, they say, shall not realize or perceive more than\nany one else. The owner of the library is not he who holds a legal title\nto it, having bought and paid for it. Any one and every one is owner of\nthe library, (indeed he or she alone is owner,) who can read the same\nthrough all the varieties of tongues and subjects and styles, and in\nwhom they enter with ease, and make supple and powerful and rich and\nlarge.\n\nThese American States, strong and healthy and accomplish'd, shall\nreceive no pleasure from violations of natural models, and must not\npermit them. In paintings or mouldings or carvings in mineral or wood,\nor in the illustrations of books or newspapers, or in the patterns of\nwoven stuffs, or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes, or\nto put upon cornices or monuments, or on the prows or sterns of ships,\nor to put anywhere before the human eye indoors or out, that which\ndistorts honest shapes, or which creates unearthly beings or places or\ncontingencies, is a nuisance and revolt. Of the human form especially,\nit is so great it must never be made ridiculous. Of ornaments to a work\nnothing outre can be allow'd--but those ornaments can be allow'd that\nconform to the perfect facts of the open air, and that flow out of the\nnature of the work, and come irrepressibly from it, and are necessary\nto the completion of the work. Most works are most beautiful without\nornament. Exaggerations will be revenged in human physiology. Clean and\nvigorous children are jetted and conceiv'd only in those communities\nwhere the models of natural forms are public every day. Great genius and\nthe people of these States must never be demean'd to romances. As soon\nas histories are properly told, no more need of romances.\n\nThe great poets are to be known by the absence in them of tricks, and by\nthe justification of perfect personal candor. All faults may be forgiven\nof him who has perfect candor. Henceforth let no man of us lie, for we\nhave seen that openness wins the inner and outer world, and that there\nis no single exception, and that never since our earth gather'd itself\nin a mass have deceit or subterfuge or prevarication attracted its\nsmallest particle or the faintest tinge of a shade--and that through the\nenveloping wealth and rank of a state, or the whole republic of states,\na sneak or sly person shall be discover'd and despised--and that the\nsoul has never once been fool'd and never can be fool'd--and thrift\nwithout the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid puff--and there\nnever grew up in any of the continents of the globe, nor upon any planet\nor satellite, nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes,\nnor at any time during the changes of life, nor in any stretch of\nabeyance or action of vitality, nor in any process of formation or\nreformation anywhere, a being whose instinct hated the truth.\n\nExtreme caution or prudence, the soundest organic health, large hope and\ncomparison and fondness for women and children, large alimentiveness\nand destuctiveness and causality, with a perfect sense of the oneness of\nnature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs,\nare called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of\nthe greatest poet from his birth out of his mother's womb, and from her\nbirth out of her mother's. Caution seldom goes far enough. It has been\nthought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to\nsolid gains, and did well for himself and for his family, and completed\na lawful life without debt or crime. The greatest poet sees and admits\nthese economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep, but has\nhigher notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives\na few slight attentions at the latch of the gate. The premises of the\nprudence of life are not the hospitality of it, or the ripeness and\nharvest of it. Beyond the independence of a little sum laid aside for\nburial-money, and of a few clap-boards around and shingles overhead on a\nlot of American soil own'd, and the easy dollars that supply the year's\nplain clothing and meals, the melancholy prudence of the abandonment\nof such a great being as a man is, to the toss and pallor of years of\nmoney-making, with all their scorching days and icy nights, and all\ntheir stifling deceits and underhand dodgings, or infinitesimals of\nparlors, or shameless stuffing while others starve, and all the loss of\nthe bloom and odor of the earth, and of the flowers and atmosphere, and\nof the sea, and of the true taste of the women and men you pass or\nhave to do with in youth or middle age, and the issuing sickness and\ndesperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naivety,\n(even if you have achiev'd a secure 10,000 a year, or election to\nCongress or the Governorship,) and the ghastly chatter of a death\nwithout serenity or majesty, is the great fraud upon modern civilization\nand forethought, blotching the surface and system which civilization\nundeniably drafts, and moistening with tears the immense features it\nspreads and spreads with such velocity before the reach'd kisses of the\nsoul.\n\nEver the right explanation remains to be made about prudence. The\nprudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the most esteem'd life\nappears too faint for the eye to observe at all, when little and large\nalike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable for\nimmortality. What is the wisdom that fills the thinness of a year, or\nseventy or eighty years--to the wisdom spaced out by ages, and coming\nback at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents,\nand the clear faces of wedding-guests as far as you can look, in every\ndirection, running gaily toward you? Only the soul is of itself--all\nelse has reference to what ensues. All that a person does or thinks is\nof consequence. Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be\nanything else' than the profoundest reason, whether it brings argument\nto hand or no. No specification is necessary--to add or subtract or\ndivide is in vain. Little or big, learn'd or unlearn'd, white or black,\nlegal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration down the\nwindpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or female\ndoes that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure profit\nto him or her in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the\nwhole scope of it forever. The prudence of the greatest poet answers\nat last the craving and glut of the soul, puts off nothing, permits\nno let-up for its own case or any case, has no particular sabbath or\njudgment day, divides not the living from the dead, or the righteous\nfrom the unrighteous, is satisfied with the present, matches every\nthought or act by its correlative, and knows no possible forgiveness or\ndeputed atonement.\n\nThe direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to-day. If\nhe does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic\ntides--if he be not himself the age transfigur'd, and if to him is not\nopen'd the eternity which gives similitude to all periods and locations\nand processes, and animate and inanimate forms, and which is the bond of\ntime, and rises up from its inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness\nin the swimming shapes of to-day, and is held by the ductile anchors of\nlife, and makes the present spot the passage from what was to what shall\nbe, and commits itself to the representation of this wave of an hour,\nand this one of the sixty beautiful children of the wave--let him merge\nin the general run, and wait his development.\n\nStill the final test of poems, or any character or work, remains. The\nprescient poet projects himself centuries ahead, and judges performer or\nperformance after the changes of time. Does it live through them? Does\nit still hold on untired? Will the same style, and the direction of\ngenius to similar points, be satisfactory now? Have the marches of tens\nand hundreds and thousands of years made willing detours to the right\nhand and the left hand for his sake? Is he beloved long and long after\nhe is buried? Does the young man think often of him? and the young woman\nthink often of him? and do the middleaged and the old think of him?\n\nA great poem is for ages and ages in common, and for all degrees and\ncomplexions, and all departments and sects, and for a woman as much as a\nman, and a man as much as a woman. A great poem is no finish to a man or\nwoman, but rather a beginning. Has any one fancied he could sit at last\nunder some due authority, and rest satisfied with explanations, and\nrealize, and be content and full? To no such terminus does the greatest\npoet bring--he brings neither cessation nor shelter'd fatness and ease.\nThe touch of him, like Nature, tells in action. Whom he takes he\ntakes with firm sure grasp into live regions previously\nunattain'd--thenceforward is no rest--they see the space and ineffable\nsheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums. Now there\nshall be a man cohered out of tumult and chaos--the elder encourages the\nyounger and shows him how--they two shall launch off fearlessly together\ntill the new world fits an orbit for itself, and looks unabash'd on the\nlesser orbits of the stars, and sweeps through the ceaseless rings, and\nshall never be quiet again.\n\nThere will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. A new order\nshall arise, and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall\nbe his own priest. They shall find their inspiration in real objects\nto-day, symptoms of the past and future. They shall not deign to defend\nimmortality or God, or the perfection of things, or liberty, or the\nexquisite beauty and reality of the soul. They shall arise in America,\nand be responded to from the remainder of the earth.\n\nThe English language befriends the grand American expression--it is\nbrawny enough, and limber and full enough. On the tough stock of a race\nwho through all change of circumstance was never without the idea of\npolitical liberty, which is the animus of all liberty, it has attracted\nthe terms of daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues.\nIt is the powerful language of resistance--it is the dialect of common\nsense. It is the speech of the proud and melancholy races, and of\nall who aspire. It is the chosen tongue to express growth, faith,\nself-esteem, freedom, justice, equality, friendliness, amplitude,\nprudence, decision, and courage. It is the medium that shall wellnigh\nexpress the inexpressible.\n\nNo great literature, nor any like style of behavior or oratory, or\nsocial intercourse or household arrangements, or public institutions,\nor the treatment by bosses of employ'd people, nor executive detail,\nor detail of the army and navy, nor spirit of legislation or courts,\nor police or tuition or architecture, or songs or amusements, can long\nelude the jealous and passionate instinct of American standards. Whether\nor no the sign appears from the mouths of the people, it throbs a live\ninterrogation in every freeman's and freewoman's heart, after that which\npasses by, or this built to remain. Is it uniform with my country?\nAre its disposals without ignominious distinctions? Is it for the\never-growing communes of brothers and lovers, large, well united, proud,\nbeyond the old models, generous beyond all models? Is it something grown\nfresh out of the fields, or drawn from the sea for use to me to-day\nhere? I know that what answers for me, an American, in Texas, Ohio,\nCanada, must answer for any individual or nation that serves for a part\nof my materials. Does this answer? Is it for the nursing of the young of\nthe republic? Does it solve readily with the sweet milk of the nipples\nof the breasts of the Mother of Many Children?\n\nAmerica prepares with Composure and good-will for the visitors that have\nsent word. It is not intellect that is to be their warrant and welcome.\nThe talented, the artist, the ingenious, the editor, the statesman, the\nerudite, are not unappreciated--they fall in their place and do their\nwork. The soul of the nation also does its work. It rejects none, it\npermits all. Only toward the like of itself will it advance half-way. An\nindividual is as superb as a nation when he has the qualities which make\na superb nation. The soul of the largest and wealthiest and proudest\nnation may well go half-way to meet that of its poets.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE, 1872 To As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free Now Thou Mother with\nthy Equal Brood, _in permanent edition_.\n\n\nThe impetus and ideas urging me, for some years past, to an utterance,\nor attempt at utterance, of New World songs, and an epic of Democracy,\nhaving already had their publish'd expression, as well as I can expect\nto give it, in \"Leaves of Grass,\" the present and any future pieces from\nme are really but the surplusage forming after that volume, or the wake\neddying behind it. I fulfill'd in that an imperious conviction, and the\ncommands of my nature as total and irresistible as those which make\nthe sea flow, or the globe revolve. But of this supplementary volume,\nI confess I am not so certain. Having from early manhood abandon'd the\nbusiness pursuits and applications usual in my time and country, and\nobediently yielded myself up ever since to the impetus mention'd, and\nto the work of expressing those ideas, it may be that mere habit has got\ndominion of me, when there is no real need of saying anything further.\nBut what is life but an experiment? and mortality but an exercise? with\nreference to results beyond. And so shall my poems be. If incomplete\nhere, and superfluous there, _n' importe_--the earnest trial and\npersistent exploration shall at least be mine, and other success failing\nshall be success enough. I have been more anxious, anyhow, to suggest\nthe songs of vital endeavor and manly evolution, and furnish something\nfor races of outdoor athletes, than to make perfect rhymes, or reign\nin the parlors. I ventur'd from the beginning my own way, taking\nchances--and would keep on venturing.\n\nI will therefore not conceal from any persons, known or unknown to me,\nwho take an interest in the matter, that I have the ambition of devoting\nyet a few years to poetic composition. The mighty present age! To absorb\nand express in poetry, anything of it--of its world--America--cities and\nStates--the years, the events of our Nineteeth century--the rapidity\nof movement--the violent contrasts, fluctuations of light and shade,\nof hope and fear--the entire revolution made by science in the poetic\nmethod--these great new underlying facts and new ideas rushing and\nspreading everywhere;--truly a mighty age! As if in some colossal drama,\nacted again like those of old under the open sun, the Nations of our\ntime, and all the characteristics of Civilization, seem hurrying,\nstalking across, flitting from wing to wing, gathering, closing up,\ntoward some long-prepared, most tremendous denouement. Not to conclude\nthe infinite scenas of the race's life and toil and happiness and\nsorrow, but haply that the boards be clear'd from oldest, worst\nincumbrances, accumulations, and Man resume the eternal play anew, and\nunder happier, freer auspices. To me, the United States are important\nbecause in this colossal drama they are unquestionably designated for\nthe leading parts, for many a century to come. In them history and\nhumanity seem to seek to culminate. Our broad areas are even now the\nbusy theatre of plots, passions, interests, and suspended problems,\ncompared to which the intrigues of the past of Europe, the wars of\ndynasties, the scope of kings and kingdoms, and even the development of\npeoples, as hitherto, exhibit scales of measurement comparatively narrow\nand trivial. And on these areas of ours, as on a stage, sooner or later,\nsomething like an _eclairissement_ of all the past civilization of\nEurope and Asia is probably to be evolved.\n\nThe leading parts. Not to be acted, emulated here, by us again, that\nrole till now foremost in history--not to become a conqueror nation,\nor to achieve the glory of mere military, or diplomatic, or commercial\nsuperiority--but to become the grand producing land of nobler men and\nwomen--of copious races, cheerful, healthy, tolerant, free--to become\nthe most friendly nation, (the United States indeed)--the modern\ncomposite nation, form'd from all, with room for all, welcoming all\nimmigrants--accepting the work of our own interior development, as the\nwork fitly filling ages and ages to come;--the leading nation of peace,\nbut neither ignorant nor incapable of being the leading nation of\nwar;--not the man's nation only, but the woman's nation--a land of\nsplendid mothers, daughters, sisters, wives.\n\nOur America to-day I consider in many respects as but indeed a vast\nseething mass of _materials_, ampler, better, (worse also,) than\npreviously known--eligible to be used to carry towards its crowning\nstage, and build for good, the great ideal nationality of the future,\nthe nation of the body and the soul,[32]--no limit here to land, help,\nopportunities, mines, products, demands, supplies, etc.;--with (I think)\nour political organization, National, State, and Municipal, permanently\nestablish'd, as far ahead as we can calculate--but, so far, no social,\nliterary, religious, or esthetic organizations, consistent with our\npolitics, or becoming to us--which organizations can only come, in time,\nthrough great democratic ideas, religion--through science, which now,\nlike a new sunrise, ascending, begins to illuminate all--and through our\nown begotten poets and literatuses. (The moral of a late well-written\nbook on civilization seems to be that the only real foundation-walls and\nbases--and also _sine qua non_ afterward--of true and full civilization,\nis the eligibility and certainty of boundless products for feeding,\nclothing, sheltering everybody--perennial fountains of physical\nand domestic comfort, with intercommunication, and with civil and\necclesiastical freedom--and that then the esthetic and mental business\nwill take care of itself. Well, the United States have establish'd this\nbasis, and upon scales of extent, variety, vitality, and continuity,\nrivaling those of Nature; and have now to proceed to build an\nedifice upon it. I say this edifice is only to be fitly built by new\nliteratures, especially the poetic. I say a modern image-making creation\nis indispensable to fuse and express the modern political and scientific\ncreations--and then the trinity will be complete.)\n\nWhen I commenced, years ago, elaborating the plan of my poems, and\ncontinued turning over that plan, and shifting it in my mind through\nmany years, (from the age of twenty-eight to thirty-five,) experimenting\nmuch, and writing and abandoning much, one deep purpose underlay the\nothers, and has underlain it and its execution ever since--and that has\nbeen the religious purpose. Amid many changes, and a formulation taking\nfar different shape from what I at first supposed, this basic purpose\nhas never been departed from in the composition of my verses. Not of\ncourse to exhibit itself in the old ways, as in writing hymns or psalms\nwith an eye to the church-pew, or to express conventional pietism, or\nthe sickly yearnings of devotees, but in new ways, and aiming at the\nwidest sub-bases and inclusions of humanity, and tallying the fresh air\nof sea and land. I will see, (said I to myself,) whether there is not,\nfor my purposes as poet, a religion, and a sound religious germenancy\nin the average human race, at least in their modern development in the\nUnited States, and in the hardy common fiber and native yearnings and\nelements, deeper and larger, and affording more profitable returns, than\nall mere sects or churches--as boundless, joyous, and vital as Nature\nitself--a germenancy that has too long been unencouraged, unsung, almost\nunknown. With science, the old theology of the East, long in its dotage,\nbegins evidently to die and disappear. But (to my mind) science--and\nmay-be such will prove its principal service--as evidently prepares\nthe way for One indescribably grander--Time's young but perfect\noffspring--the new theology--heir of the West--lusty and loving, and\nwondrous beautiful. For America, and for today, just the same as any\nday, the supreme and final science is the science of God--what we call\nscience being only its minister--as Democracy is, or shall be also. And\na poet of America (I said) must fill himself with such thoughts, and\nchant his best out of them. And as those were the convictions and aims,\nfor good or bad, of \"Leaves of Grass,\" they are no less the intention\nof this volume. As there can be, in my opinion, no sane and complete\npersonality, nor any grand and electric nationality, without the stock\nelement of religion imbuing all the other elements, (like heat in\nchemistry, invisible itself, but the life of all visible life,) so there\ncan be no poetry worthy the name without that element behind all. The\ntime has certainly come to begin to discharge the idea of religion,\nin the United States, from mere ecclesiasticism, and from Sundays and\nchurches and church-going, and assign it to that general position,\nchiefest, most indispensable, most exhilarating, to which the others\nare to be adjusted, inside of all human character, and education, and\naffairs. The people, especially the young men and women of America,\nmust begin to learn that religion, (like poetry,) is something far, far\ndifferent from what they supposed. It is, indeed, too important to the\npower and perpetuity of the New World to be consign'd any longer to the\nchurches, old or new, Catholic or Protestant--Saint this, or Saint\nthat. It must be consign'd henceforth to democracy _en masse_, and to\nliterature. It must enter into the poems of the nation. It must make the\nnation.\n\nThe Four Years' War is over--and in the peaceful, strong, exciting,\nfresh occasions of to-day, and of the future, that strange, sad war is\nhurrying even now to be forgotten. The camp, the drill, the lines of\nsentries, the prisons, the hospitals--(ah! the hospitals!)--all have\npassed away--all seem now like a dream. A new race, a young and lusty\ngeneration, already sweeps in with oceanic currents, obliterating the\nwar, and all its scars, its mounded graves, and all its reminiscences of\nhatred, conflict, death. So let It be obliterated. I say the life of the\npresent and the future makes undeniable demands upon us each and all,\nsouth, north, east, west. To help put the United States (even if only in\nimagination) hand in hand, in one unbroken circle in a chant--to rouse\nthem to the unprecedented grandeur of the part they are to play, and are\neven now playing--to the thought of their great future, and the attitude\nconform'd to it--especially their great esthetic, moral, scientific\nfuture, (of which their vulgar material and political present is but\nas the preparatory tuning of instruments by an orchestra,) these, as\nhitherto, are still, for me, among my hopes, ambitions.\n\n\"Leaves of Grass,\" already publish'd, is, in its intentions, the song of\na great composite _democratic individual_, male or female. And following\non and amplifying the same purpose, I suppose I have in my mind to\nrun through the chants of this volume, (if ever completed,) the\nthread-voice, more or less audible, of an aggregated, inseparable,\nunprecedented, vast, composite, electric _democratic nationality_.\n\nPurposing, then, to still fill out, from time to time through years to\ncome, the following volume, (unless prevented,) I conclude this\npreface to the first instalment of it, pencil'd in the open air, on my\nfifty-third birth-day, by wafting to you, dear reader, whoever you are,\n(from amid the fresh scent of the grass, the pleasant coolness of the\nforenoon breeze, the lights and shades of tree-boughs silently dappling\nand playing around me, and the notes of the cat-bird for undertone and\naccompaniment,) my true good-will and love. W. W. _Washington, D. C.,\nMay_ 31, 1872.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[32] The problems of the achievements of this crowning stage through\nfuture first-class National Singers, Orators, Artists, and others--of\ncreating in literature an _imaginative_ New World, the correspondent and\ncounterpart of the current Scientific and Political New Worlds,--and the\nperhaps distant, but still delightful prospect, (for our children, if\nnot in our own day,) of delivering America, and, indeed, all Christian\nlands everywhere, from the thin moribund and watery, but appallingly\nextensive nuisance of conventional poetry--by putting something really\nalive and substantial in its place--I have undertaken to grapple with,\nand argue, in the preceding \"Democratic Vistas.\"\n\n\nPREFACE, 1876 _To the two-volume Centennial Edition of_ Leaves of Grass\n_and_ Two Rivulets.\n\n\nAt the eleventh hour, under grave illness, I gather up the pieces of\nprose and poetry left over since publishing, a while since, my first and\nmain volume, \"Leaves or Grass\"--pieces, here, some new, some old--nearly\nall of them (sombre as many are, making this almost death's book)\ncomposed in by-gone atmospheres of perfect health--and preceded by\nthe freshest collection, the little \"Two Rivulets,\" now send them\nout, embodied in the present melange, partly as my contribution and\noutpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the\nfirst centennial of our New World nationality--and then as chyle and\nnutriment to that moral, indissoluble union, equally representing all,\nand the mother of many coming centennials.\n\nAnd e'en for flush and proof of our America--for reminder, just as much,\nor more, in moods of towering pride and joy, I keep my special chants of\ndeath and immortality[33] to stamp the coloring-finish of all, present\nand past. For terminus and temperer to all, they were originally\nwritten; and that shall be their office at the last.\n\nFor some reason--not explainable or definite to my own mind, yet\nsecretly pleasing and satisfactory to it--I have not hesitated to\nembody in, and run through the volume, two altogether distinct veins,\nor strata--politics for one, and for the other, the pensive thought\nof immortality. Thus, too, the prose and poetic, the dual forms of the\npresent book. The volume, therefore, after its minor episodes, probably\ndivides into these two, at first sight far diverse, veins of topic and\ntreatment. Three points, in especial, have become very dear to me,\nand all through I seek to make them again and again, in many forms and\nrepetitions, as will be seen: 1. That the true growth-characteristics\nof the democracy of the New World are henceforth to radiate in superior\nliterary, artistic and religious expressions, far more than in its\nrepublican forms, universal suffrage, and frequent elections, (though\nthese are unspeakably important.) 2. That the vital political mission of\nthe United States is, to practically solve and settle the problem of\ntwo sets of rights--the fusion, thorough compatibility and junction\nof individual State prerogatives, with the indispensable necessity\nof centrality and Oneness--the national identity power--the sovereign\nUnion, relentless, permanently comprising all, and over all, and in that\nnever yielding an inch: then 3d. Do we not, amid a general malaria of\nfogs and vapors, our day, unmistakably see two pillars of promise, with\ngrandest, indestructible indications--one, that the morbid facts of\nAmerican politics and society everywhere are but passing incidents and\nflanges of our unbounded impetus of growth? weeds, annuals, of the rank,\nrich soil--not central, enduring, perennial things? The other, that all\nthe hitherto experience of the States, their first century, has been\nbut preparation, adolescence--and that this Union is only now and\nhenceforth, (_i.e._, since the secession war,) to enter on its full\ndemocratic career?\n\nOf the whole, poems and prose, (not attending at all to chronological\norder, and with original dates and passing allusions in the heat and\nimpression of the hour, left shuffled in, and undisturb'd,) the chants\nof \"Leaves of Grass,\" my former volume, yet serve as the indispensable\ndeep soil, or basis, out of which, and out of which only, could come the\nroots and stems more definitely indicated by these later pages. (While\nthat volume radiates physiology alone, the present one, though of the\nlike origin in the main, more palpably doubtless shows the pathology\nwhich was pretty sure to come in time from the other.)\n\nIn that former and main volume, composed in the flush of my health and\nstrength, from the age of 30 to 50 years, I dwelt on birth and life,\nclothing my ideas in pictures, days, transactions of my time, to give\nthem positive place, identity--saturating them with that vehemence\nof pride and audacity of freedom necessary to loosen the mind\nof still-to-be-form'd America from the accumulated folds, the\nsuperstitions, and all the long, tenacious and stifling anti-democratic\nauthorities of the Asiatic and European past--my enclosing purport being\nto express, above all artificial regulation and aid, the eternal bodily\ncomposite, cumulative, natural character of one's self.[34]\n\nEstimating the American Union as so far, and for some time to come, in\nits yet formative condition, I bequeath poems and essays as nutriment\nand influences to help truly assimilate and harden, and especially to\nfurnish something toward what the States most need of all, and which\nseems to me yet quite unsupplied in literature, namely, to show them, or\nbegin to show them, themselves distinctively, and what they are for.\nFor though perhaps the main points of all ages and nations are points of\nresemblance, and, even while granting evolution, are substantially the\nsame, there are some vital things in which this Republic, as to its\nindividualities, and as a compacted Nation, is to specially stand forth,\nand culminate modern humanity. And these are the very things it least\nmorally and mentally knows--(though, curiously enough, it is at the same\ntime faithfully acting upon them.)\n\nI count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the United\nStates--different from, though founded on, the past--that I have always\ninvoked that future, and surrounded myself with it, before or while\nsinging my songs. (As ever, all tends to followings--America, too, is a\nprophecy. What, even of the best and most successful, would be justified\nby itself alone? by the present, or the material ostent alone? Of men or\nStates, few realize how much they live in the future. That, rising\nlike pinnacles, gives its main significance to all You and I are doing\nto-day. Without it, there were little meaning in lands or poems--little\npurport in human lives. All ages, all Nations and States, have been such\nprophecies. But where any former ones with prophecy so broad, so clear,\nas our times, our lands--as those of the West?)\n\nWithout being a scientist, I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions\nof the great savants and experimentalists of our time, and of the last\nhundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my\nverse, for purposes beyond. Following the modern spirit, the real poems\nof the present, ever solidifying and expanding into the future, must\nvocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has\ninvested man and the universe, (all that is called creation) and\nmust henceforth launch humanity into new orbits, consonant, with that\nvastness, splendor, and reality, (unknown to the old poems,) like new\nsystems of orbs, balanced upon themselves, revolving in limitless space,\nmore subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at\npresent wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery\nand superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the\npast, nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous\ninnovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion,\nbe the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all\nfirst-class songs.\n\nOnly, (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry,) joyfully\naccepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest\nhesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a\nhigher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too,) the spiritual,\nthe religious--which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my\nopinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities and\nsuperstitions, and launch forth in renew'd faith and scope a hundred\nfold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the\ndivine, and of the ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in\nhumanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the\nobjective worlds. To me\n\n      The prophet and the bard,\n    Shall yet maintain themselves--in higher circles yet,\n    Shall mediate to the modern, to democracy--interpret yet to them,\n      God and eidolons.\n\nTo me, the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for\na more splendid theology, and for ampler and diviner songs. No year, nor\neven century, will settle this. There is a phase of the real, lurking\nbehind the real, which it is all for. There is also in the intellect of\nman, in time, far in prospective recesses, a judgment, a last appellate\ncourt, which will settle it.\n\nIn certain parts in these flights, or attempting to depict or suggest\nthem, I have not been afraid of the charge of obscurity, in either of\nmy two volumes-because human thought, poetry or melody, must leave dim\nescapes and outlets-must possess a certain fluid, aerial character,\nakin to space itself, obscure to those of little or no imagination,--but\nindispensable to the highest purposes. Poetic style, when address'd to\nthe soul, is less definite form, outline, sculpture, and becomes vista,\nmusic, half-tints, and even less than half-tints. True, it may be\narchitecture; but again it may be the forest wild-wood, or the best\neffect thereof, at twilight, the waving oaks and cedars in the wind, and\nthe impalpable odor.\n\nFinally, as I have lived in fresh lands, inchoate, and in a\nrevolutionary age, future-founding, I have felt to identify the points\nof that age, these lands, in my recitatives, altogether in my own way.\nThus my form has strictly grown from my purports and facts, and is the\nanalogy of them. Within my time the United States have emerged from\nnebulous vagueness and suspense, to full orbic, (though varied,)\ndecision--have done the deeds and achiev'd the triumphs of half a score\nof centuries--and are henceforth to enter upon their real history the\nway being now, (_i.e._ since the result of the secession war,) clear'd\nof death-threatening impedimenta, and the free areas around and ahead\nof us assured and certain, which were not so before--(the past century\nbeing but preparations, trial voyages and experiments of the ship,\nbefore her starting out upon deep water.)\n\nIn estimating my volumes, the world's current times and deeds, and their\nspirit, must be first profoundly estimated. Out of the hundred years\njust ending, (1776-1876,) with their genesis of inevitable wilful\nevents, and new experiments and introductions, and many unprecedented\nthings of war and peace, (to be realized better, perhaps only realized,\nat the remove of a century hence;) out of that stretch of time,\nand especially out of the immediately preceding twenty-five years,\n(1850-'75,) with all their rapid changes, innovations, and audacious\nmovements-and bearing their own inevitable wilful birth-marks--the\nexperiments of my poems too have found genesis.\n\nW. W.\n\nNotes:\n\n[33] PASSAGE TO INDIA.--As in some ancient legend-play, to close the\nplot and the hero's career, there is a farewell gathering on ship's deck\nand on shore, a loosing of hawsers and ties, a spreading of sails to\nthe wind--a starting out on unknown seas, to fetch up no one knows\nwhither--to return no more--and the curtain falls, and there is the end\nof it--so I have reserv'd that poem, with its cluster, to finish and\nexplain much that, without them, would not be explain'd, and to take\nleave, and escape for good, from all that has preceded them. (Then\nprobably \"Passage to India,\" and its cluster, are but freer vent and\nfuller expression to what, from the first, and so on throughout, more\nor less lurks in my writings, underneath every page, every line,\neverywhere.)\n\nI am not sure but the last inclosing sublimation of race or poem is,\nwhat it thinks of death. After the rest has been comprehended and said,\neven the grandest--after those contributions to mightiest nationality,\nor to sweetest song, or to the best personalism, male or female, have\nbeen glean'd from the rich and varied themes of tangible life, and\nhave been fully accepted and sung, and the pervading fact of visible\nexistence, with the duty it devolves, is rounded and apparently\ncompleted, it still remains to be really completed by suffusing through\nthe whole and several, that other pervading invisible fact, so large a\npart, (is it not the largest part?) of life here, combining the rest,\nand furnishing, for person or State, the only permanent and unitary\nmeaning to all, even the meanest life, consistently with the dignity of\nthe universe, in Time. As from the eligibility to this thought, and the\ncheerful conquest of this fact, flash forth the first distinctive\nproofs of the soul, so to me, (extending it only a little further,) the\nultimate Democratic purports, the ethereal and spiritual ones, are to\nconcentrate here, and as fixed stars, radiate hence. For, in my opinion,\nit is no less than this idea of immortality, above all other ideas,\nthat is to enter into, and vivify, and give crowning religious stamp, to\ndemocracy in the New World.\n\nIt was originally my intention, after chanting in \"Leaves of Grass\"\nthe songs of the body and existence, to then compose a further, equally\nneeded volume, based on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation\nwhich, enveloping all precedents, make the unseen soul govern absolutely\nat last. I meant, while in a sort continuing the theme of my first\nchants, to shift the slides, and exhibit the problem and paradox of the\nsame ardent and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of\nthe resistless gravitation of spiritual law, and with cheerful face\nestimating death, not at all as the cessation, but as somehow what\nI feel it must be, the entrance upon by far the greatest part of\nexistence, and something that life is at least as much for, as it is for\nitself. But the full construction of such a work is beyond my powers,\nand must remain for some bard in the future. The physical and the\nsensuous, in themselves or in their immediate continuations, retain\nholds upon me which I think are never entirely releas'd; and those holds\nI have not only not denied, but hardly wish'd to weaken.\n\nMeanwhile, not entirely to give the go-by to my original plan, and far\nmore to avoid a mark'd hiatus in it, than to entirely fulfil it, I\nend my books with thoughts, or radiations from thoughts, on death,\nimmortality, and a free entrance into the spiritual world. In those\nthoughts, in a sort, I make the first steps or studies toward the mighty\ntheme, from the point of view necessitated by my foregoing poems, and\nby modern science. In them I also seek to set the key-stone to my\ndemocracy's enduring arch. I recollate them now, for the press, in\norder to partially occupy and offset days of strange sickness, and the\nheaviest affliction and bereavement of my life; and I fondly please\nmyself with the notion of leaving that cluster to you, O unknown reader\nof the future, as \"something to remember me by,\" more especially than\nall else. Written in former days of perfect health, little did I think\nthe pieces had the purport that now, under present circumstances, opens\nto me.\n\n[As I write these lines, May 31, 1875, it is again early summer,--again\nmy birth-day--now my fifty-sixth. Amid the outside beauty and freshness,\nthe sunlight and verdure of the delightful season, O how different the\nmoral atmosphere amid which I now revise this Volume, from the jocund\ninfluence surrounding the growth and advent of \"Leaves of Grass.\" I\noccupy myself, arranging these pages for publication, still envelopt\nin thoughts of the death two years since of my dear Mother, the most\nperfect and magnetic character, the rarest combination of practical,\nmoral and spiritual, and the least selfish, of all and any I have ever\nknown--and by me O so much the most deeply loved--and also under the\nphysical affliction of a tedious attack of paralysis, obstinately\nlingering and keeping its hold upon me, and quite suspending all bodily\nactivity and comfort.]\n\nUnder these influences, therefore, I still feel to keep \"Passage to\nIndia\" for last words even to this centennial dithyramb. Not as, in\nantiquity, at highest festival of Egypt, the noisome skeleton of death\nwas sent on exhibition to the revelers, for zest and shadow to the\noccasion's joy and light--but as the marble statue of the normal Greeks\nat Elis, suggesting death in the form of a beautiful and perfect young\nman, with closed eyes, leaning on an inverted torch--emblem of rest and\naspiration after action--of crown and point which all lives and poems\nshould steadily have reference to, namely, the justified and noble\ntermination of our identity, this grade of it, and outlet-preparation to\nanother grade.\n\n[34] Namely, a character, making most of common and normal elements, to\nthe superstructure of which not only the precious accumulations of the\nlearning and experiences of the Old World, and the settled social and\nmunicipal necessities and current requirements, so long a-building,\nshall still faithfully contribute, but which at its foundations and\ncarried up thence, and receiving its impetus from the democratic spirit,\nand accepting its gauge in all departments from the democratic formulas,\nshall again directly be vitalized by the perennial influences of Nature\nat first hand, and the old heroic stamina of Nature, the strong air\nof prairie and mountain, the dash of the briny sea, the primary\nantiseptics--of the passions, in all their fullest heat and potency,\nof courage, rankness, amativeness, and of immense pride. Not to lose at\nall, therefore, the benefits of artificial progress and civilization,\nbut to re-occupy for Western tenancy the oldest though ever-fresh\nfields, and reap from them the savage and sane nourishment indispensable\nto a hardy nation, and the absence of which, threatening to become worse\nand worse, is the most serious lack and defect to-day of our New World\nliterature.\n\nNot but what the brawn of \"Leaves of Grass\" is, I hope, thoroughly\nspiritualized everywhere, for final estimate, but, from the very\nsubjects, the direct effect is a sense of the life, as it should be, of\nflesh and blood, and physical urge, and animalism. While there are other\nthemes, and plenty of abstract thoughts and poems in the volume--while\nI have put in it passing and rapid but actual glimpses of the great\nstruggle between the nation and the slave-power, (1861-'65,) as the\nfierce and bloody panorama of that contest unroll'd itself: while the\nwhole book, indeed, revolves around that four years' war, which, as I\nwas in the midst of it, becomes, in \"Drum-Taps,\" pivotal to the rest\nentire--and here and there, before and afterward, not a few episodes\nand speculations--_that_--namely, to make a type-portrait for living,\nactive, worldly, healthy personality, objective as well as subjective,\njoyful and potent, and modern and free, distinctively for the use of\nthe United States, male and female, through the long future--has been,\nI say, my general object. (Probably, indeed, the whole of these varied\nsongs, and all my writings, both volumes, only ring changes in some\nsort, on the ejaculation, How vast, how eligible, how joyful, how real,\nis a human being, himself or herself.)\n\nThough from no definite plan at the time, I see now that I have\nunconsciously sought, by indirections at least as much as directions, to\nexpress the whirls and rapid growth and intensity of the United States,\nthe prevailing tendency and events of the Nineteenth century, and\nlargely the spirit of the whole current world, my time; for I feel that\nI have partaken of that spirit, as I have been deeply interested in\nall those events, the closing of long-stretch'd eras and ages, and,\nillustrated in the history of the United States, the opening of larger\nones. (The death of President Lincoln, for instance, fitly, historically\ncloses, in the civilization of feudalism, many old influences--drops on\nthem, suddenly, a vast, gloomy, as it were, separating curtain.)\n\nSince I have been ill, (1873-'74-'75,) mostly without serious pain, and\nwith plenty of time and frequent inclination to judge my poems,\n(never composed with eye on the book-market, nor for fame, nor for any\npecuniary profit,) I have felt temporary depression more than once, for\nfear that in \"Leaves of Grass\" the _moral_ parts were not sufficiently\npronounced. But in my clearest and calmest moods I have realized that\nas those \"Leaves,\" all and several, surely prepare the way for, and\nnecessitate morals, and are adjusted to them, just the same as Nature\ndoes and is, they are what, consistently with my plan, they must and\nprobably should be. (In a certain sense, while the Moral is the purport\nand last intelligence of all Nature, there is absolutely nothing of\nthe moral in the works, or laws, or shows of Nature. Those only lead\ninevitably to it--begin and necessitate it.)\n\nThen I meant \"Leaves of Grass,\" as publish'd, to be the Poem of average\nIdentity, (of _yours_, whoever you are, now reading these lines.) A man\nis not greatest as victor in war, nor inventor or explorer, nor even\nin science, or in his intellectual or artistic capacity, or exemplar\nin some vast benevolence. To the highest democratic view, man is most\nacceptable in living well the practical life and lot which happens\nto him as ordinary farmer, sea-farer, mechanic, clerk, laborer, or\ndriver--upon and from which position as a central basis or pedestal,\nwhile performing its labors, and his duties as citizen, son, husband,\nfather and employ'd person, he preserves his physique, ascends,\ndeveloping, radiating himself in other regions--and especially where\nand when, (greatest of all, and nobler than the proudest mere genius or\nmagnate in any field,) he fully realizes the conscience, the spiritual,\nthe divine faculty, cultivated well, exemplified in all his deeds and\nwords, through life, uncompromising to the end--a flight loftier\nthan any of Homer's or Shakspere's--broader than all poems and\nbibles--namely, Nature's own, and in the midst of it, Yourself, your own\nIdentity, body and soul. (All serves, helps--but in the centre of all,\nabsorbing all, giving, for your purpose, the only meaning and vitality\nto all, master or mistress of all, under the law, stands Yourself.)\nTo sing the Song of that law of average Identity, and of Yourself,\nconsistently with the divine law of the universal, is a main intention\nof those \"Leaves.\"\n\nSomething more may be added--for, while I am about it, I would make a\nfull confession. I also sent out \"Leaves of Grass\" to arouse and set\nflowing in men's and women's hearts, young and old, endless streams of\nliving, pulsating love and friendship, directly from them to myself, now\nand ever. To this terrible, irrepressible yearning, (surely more or less\ndown underneath in most human souls)--this never-satisfied appetite\nfor sympathy, and this boundless offering of sympathy--this universal\ndemocratic comradeship-this old, eternal, yet ever-new interchange of\nadhesiveness, so fitly emblematic of America--I have given in that book,\nundisguisedly, declaredly, the openest expression. Besides, important\nas they are in my purpose as emotional expressions for humanity, the\nspecial meaning of the \"Calamus\" cluster of \"Leaves of Grass,\" (and\nmore or less running through the book, and cropping out in \"Drum-Taps,\")\nmainly resides in its political significance. In my opinion, it is by\na fervent, accepted development of comradeship, the beautiful and sane\naffection of man for man, latent in all the young fellows, north and\nsouth, east and west--it is by this, I say, and by what goes directly\nand indirectly along with it, that the United States of the future, (I\ncannot too often repeat,) are to be most effectually welded together,\nintercalated, anneal'd into a living union.\n\nThen, for enclosing clue of all, it is imperatively and ever to be\nborne in mind that \"Leaves of Grass\" entire is not to be construed as an\nintellectual or scholastic effort or poem mainly, but more as a radical\nutterance out of the Emotions and the Physique--an utterance adjusted\nto, perhaps born of, Democracy and the Modern--in its very nature\nregardless of the old conventions, and, under the great laws, following\nonly its own impulses.\n\n\n\nPOETRY TO-DAY IN AMERICA\n\nSHAKSPERE--THE FUTURE\n\n\nStrange as it may seem, the topmost proof of a race is its own born\npoetry. The presence of that, or the absence, each tells its story. As\nthe flowering rose or lily, as the ripened fruit to a tree, the apple or\nthe peach, no matter how fine the trunk, or copious or rich the branches\nand foliage, here waits _sine qua non_ at last. The stamp of entire and\nfinished greatness to any nation, to the American Republic among the\nrest, must be sternly withheld till it has put what it stands for in the\nblossom of original, first-class poems. No imitations will do.\n\nAnd though no _esthetik_ worthy the present condition or future\ncertainties of the New World seems to have been outlined in men's minds,\nor has been generally called for, or thought needed, I am clear that\nuntil the United States have just such definite and native expressers\nin the highest artistic fields, their mere political, geographical,\nwealth-forming, and even intellectual eminence, however astonishing\nand predominant, will constitute but a more and more expanded and\nwell-appointed body, and perhaps brain, with little or no soul.\nSugar-coat the grim truth as we may, and ward off with outward plausible\nwords, denials, explanations, to the mental inward perception of the\nland this blank is plain; a barren void exists. For the meanings and\nmaturer purposes of these States are not the constructing of a new world\nof politics merely, and physical comforts for the million, but even more\ndeterminedly, in range with science and the modern, of a new world of\ndemocratic sociology and imaginative literature. If the latter were not\nestablish'd for the States, to form their only permanent tie and hold,\nthe first-named would be of little avail.\n\nWith the poems of a first-class land are twined, as weft with warp, its\ntypes of personal character, of individuality, peculiar, native, its\nown physiognomy, man's and woman's, its own shapes, forms, and manners,\nfully justified under the eternal laws of all forms, all manners, all\ntimes. The hour has come for democracy in America to inaugurate\nitself in the two directions specified--autochthonic poems and\npersonalities--born expressers of itself, its spirit alone, to radiate\nin subtle ways, not only in art, but the practical and familiar, in the\ntransactions between employers and employed persons, in business and\nwages, and sternly in the army and navy, and revolutionizing them. I\nfind nowhere a scope profound enough, and radical and objective enough,\neither for aggregates or individuals. The thought and identity of\na poetry in America to fill, and worthily fill, the great void, and\nenhance these aims, electrifying all and several, involves the essence\nand integral facts, real and spiritual, of the whole land, the whole\nbody. What the great sympathetic is to the congeries of bones, joints,\nheart, fluids, nervous system and vitality, constituting, launching\nforth in time and space a human being--aye, an immortal soul--such\nrelation, and no less, holds true poetry to the single personality, or\nto the nation.\n\nHere our thirty-eight States stand to-day, the children of past\nprecedents, and, young as they are, heirs of a very old estate. One or\ntwo points we will consider, out of the myriads presenting themselves.\nThe feudalism, of the British Islands, illustrated by Shakspere--and by\nhis legitimate followers, Walter Scott and Alfred Tennyson--with all its\ntyrannies, superstitions, evils, had most superb and heroic permeating\nveins, poems, manners; even its errors fascinating. It almost seems as\nif only that feudalism in Europe, like slavery in our own South, could\noutcrop types of tallest, noblest personal character yet--strength and\ndevotion and love better than elsewhere--invincible courage, generosity,\naspiration, the spines of all. Here is where Shakspere and the others\nI have named perform a service incalculably precious to our America.\nPolitics, literature, and everything else, centers at last in perfect\n_personnel_, (as democracy is to find the same as the rest;) and here\nfeudalism is unrival'd--here the rich and highest-rising lessons it\nbequeaths us--a mass of foreign nutriment, which we are to work over,\nand popularize and enlarge, and present again in our own growths.\n\nStill there are pretty grave and anxious drawbacks, jeopardies, fears.\nLet us give some reflections on the subject, a little fluctuating, but\nstarting from one central thought, and returning there again. Two or\nthree curious results may plow up. As in the astronomical laws, the\nvery power that would seem most deadly and destructive turns out to be\nlatently conservative of longest, vastest future births and lives.\nWe will for once briefly examine the just-named authors solely from a\nWestern point of view. It may be, indeed, that we shall use the sun\nof English literature, and the brightest current stars of his system,\nmainly as pegs to hang some cogitations on, for home inspection.\n\nAs depicter and dramatist of the passions at their stormiest outstretch,\nthough ranking high, Shakspere (spanning the arch wide enough) is\nequaled by several, and excelled by the best old Greeks, (as Eschylus.)\nBut in portraying mediaeval European lords and barons, the arrogant\nport, so dear to the inmost human heart, (pride! pride! dearest,\nperhaps, of all--touching us, too, of the States closest of all--closer\nthan love,) he stands alone, and I do not wonder he so witches the\nworld.\n\nFrom first to last, also, Walter Scott and Tennyson, like Shakspere,\nexhale that principle of caste which we Americans have come on earth to\ndestroy. Jefferson's verdict on the Waverley novels was that they turned\nand condensed brilliant but entirely false lights and glamours over the\nlords, ladies, and aristocratic institutes of Europe, with all\ntheir measureless infamies, and then left the bulk of the suffering,\ndown-trodden people contemptuously in the shade. Without stopping to\nanswer this hornet-stinging criticism, or to repay any part of the\ndebt of thanks I owe, in common with every American, to the noblest,\nhealthiest, cheeriest romancer that ever lived, I pass on to Tennyson,\nhis works.\n\nPoetry here of a very high (perhaps the highest) order of verbal\nmelody, exquisitely clean and pure, and almost always perfumed, like the\ntuberose, to an extreme of sweetness--sometimes not, however, but even\nthen a camellia of the hot-house, never a common flower--the verse\nof inside elegance and high-life; and yet preserving amid all its\nsuper-delicatesse a smack of outdoors and outdoor folk. The old Norman\nlordhood quality here, too, crossed with that Saxon fiber from which\ntwain the best current stock of England springs--poetry that revels\nabove all things in traditions of knights and chivalry, and deeds of\nderring-do. The odor of English social life in its highest range--a\nmelancholy, affectionate, very manly, but dainty breed--pervading\nthe pages like an invisible scent; the idleness, the traditions, the\nmannerisms, the stately _ennui_; the yearning of love, like a spinal\nmarrow, inside of all; the costumes brocade and satin; the old\nhouses and furniture--solid oak, no mere veneering--the moldy secrets\neverywhere; the verdure, the ivy on the walls, the moat, the English\nlandscape outside, the buzzing fly in the sun inside the window pane.\nNever one democratic page; nay, not a line, not a word; never free and\n_naive_ poetry, but involved, labored, quite sophisticated--even when\nthe theme is ever so simple or rustic, (a shell, a bit of sedge, the\ncommonest love-passage between a lad and lass,) the handling of the\nrhyme all showing the scholar and conventional gentleman; showing the\nlaureate too, the _attache_ of the throne, and most excellent, too;\nnothing better through the volumes than the dedication \"to the Queen\"\nat the beginning, and the other fine dedication, \"these to his memory\"\n(Prince Albert's,) preceding \"Idylls of the King.\"\n\nSuch for an off-hand summary of the mighty three that now, by the women,\nmen, and young folk of the fifty millions given these States by their\nlate census, have been and are more read than all others put together.\n\nWe hear it said, both of Tennyson and another current leading literary\nillustrator of Great Britain, Carlyle--as of Victor Hugo in France--that\nnot one of them is personally friendly or admirant toward America;\nindeed, quite the reverse. _N'importe_. That they (and more good minds\nthan theirs) cannot span the vast revolutionary arch thrown by the\nUnited States over the centuries, fixed in the present, launched to\nthe endless future; that they cannot stomach the high-life-below-stairs\ncoloring all our poetic and genteel social status so far--the\nmeasureless viciousness of the great radical Republic, with its\nruffianly nominations and elections; its loud, ill-pitched voice,\nutterly regardless whether the verb agrees with the nominative; its\nfights, errors, eructations, repulsions, dishonesties, audacities;\nthose fearful and varied and long-continued storm and stress stages (so\noffensive to the well-regulated college-bred mind) wherewith Nature,\nhistory, and time block out nationalities more powerful than the\npast, and to upturn it and press on to the future;--that they cannot\nunderstand and fathom all this, I say, is it to be wondered at?\nFortunately, the gestation of our thirty-eight empires (and plenty more\nto come) proceeds on its course, on scales of area and velocity immense\nand absolute as the globe, and, like the globe itself, quite oblivious\neven of great poets and thinkers. But we can by no means afford to be\noblivious of them.\n\nThe same of feudalism, its castles, courts, etiquettes, personalities.\nHowever they, or the spirits of them hovering in the air, might scowl\nand glower at such removes as current Kansas or Kentucky life and forms,\nthe latter may by no means repudiate or leave out the former. Allowing\nall the evil that it did, we get, here and today, a balance of good out\nof its reminiscence almost beyond price.\n\nAm I content, then, that the general interior chyle of our republic\nshould be supplied and nourish'd by wholesale from foreign and\nantagonistic sources such as these? Let me answer that question briefly:\n\nYears ago I thought Americans ought to strike out separate, and have\nexpressions of their own in highest literature. I think so still,\nand more decidedly than ever. But those convictions are now strongly\ntemper'd by some additional points, (perhaps the results of advancing\nage, or the reflection of invalidism.) I see that this world of the\nWest, as part of all, fuses inseparably with the East, and with all,\nas time does--the ever new yet old, old human race--\"the same subject\ncontinued,\" as the novels of our grandfathers had it for chapter-heads.\nIf we are not to hospitably receive and complete the inaugurations of\nthe old civilizations, and change their small scale to the largest,\nbroadest scale, what on earth are we for?\n\nThe currents of practical business in America, the rude, coarse,\ntussling facts of our lives, and all their daily experiences, need just\nthe precipitation and tincture of this entirely different fancy world\nof lulling, contrasting, even feudalistic, anti-republican poetry and\nromance. On the enormous outgrowth of our unloos'd individualities,\nand the rank, self-assertion of humanity here, may well fall these\ngrace-persuading, _recherche_ influences. We first require that\nindividuals and communities shall be free; then surely comes a time\nwhen it is requisite that they shall not be too free. Although to such\nresults in the future I look mainly for a great poetry native to us,\nthese importations till then will have to be accepted, such as they are,\nand thankful they are no worse. The inmost spiritual currents of the\npresent time curiously revenge and check their own compell'd tendency\nto democracy, and absorption in it, by mark'd leanings to the past--by\nreminiscences in poems, plots, operas, novels, to a far-off, contrary,\ndeceased world, as if they dreaded the great vulgar gulf-tides of\nto-day. Then what has been fifty centuries growing, working in, and\naccepted as crowns and apices for our kind, is not going to be pulled\ndown and discarded in a hurry.\n\nIt is, perhaps, time we paid our respects directly to the honorable\nparty, the real object of these preambles. But we must make\n_reconnaissance_ a little further still. Not the least part of our\nlesson were to realize the curiosity and interest of friendly foreign\nexperts,[35] and how our situation looks to them. \"American poetry,\"\nsays the London \"Times,\"[36] is the poetry of apt pupils, but it is\nafflicted from first to last with a fatal want of raciness. Bryant has\nbeen long passed as a poet by Professor Longfellow; but in Longfellow,\nwith all his scholarly grace and tender feeling, the defect is more\napparent than it was in Bryant. Mr. Lowell can overflow with American\nhumor when politics inspire his muse; but in the realm of pure poetry he\nis no more American than a Newdigate prize-man. Joaquin Miller's verse\nhas fluency and movement and harmony, but as for the thought, his songs\nof the sierras might as well have been written in Holland.\n\nUnless in a certain very slight contingency, the \"Times\" says: \"American\nverse, from its earliest to its latest stages, seems an exotic, with an\nexuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. That\nis the very note and test of its inherent want. Great poets are tortured\nand massacred by having their flowers of fancy gathered and gummed down\nin the _hortus siccus_ of an anthology. American poets show better in\nan anthology than in the collected volumes of their works. Like their\naudience they have been unable to resist the attraction of the vast\norbit of English literature. They may talk of the primeval forest, but\nit would generally be very hard from internal evidence to detect that\nthey were writing on the banks of the Hudson rather than on those of the\nThames. ....In fact, they have caught the English tone and air and mood\nonly too faithfully, and are accepted by the superficially cultivated\nEnglish intelligence as readily as if they were English born. Americans\nthemselves confess to a certain disappointment that a literary curiosity\nand intelligence so diffused [as in the United States] have not taken\nup English literature at the point at which America has received it, and\ncarried it forward and developed it with an independent energy. But like\nreader like poet. Both show the effects of having come into an estate\nthey have not earned. A nation of readers has required of its poets a\ndiction and symmetry of form equal to that of an old literature like\nthat of Great Britain, which is also theirs. No ruggedness, however\nracy, would be tolerated by circles which, however superficial their\nculture, read Byron and Tennyson.\"\n\nThe English critic, though a gentleman and a scholar, and friendly\nwithal, is evidently not altogether satisfied, (perhaps he is jealous,)\nand winds up by saying: \"For the English language to have been enriched\nwith a national poetry which was not English but American, would have\nbeen a treasure beyond price.\" With which, as whet and foil, we shall\nproceed to ventilate more definitely certain no doubt willful opinions.\n\nLeaving unnoticed at present the great masterpieces of the antique, or\nanything from the middle ages, the prevailing flow of poetry for the\nlast fifty or eighty years, and now at its height, has been and is (like\nthe music) an expression of mere surface melody, within narrow limits,\nand yet, to give it its due, perfectly satisfying to the demands of the\near, of wondrous charm, of smooth and easy delivery, and the triumph of\ntechnical art. Above all things it is fractional and select. It shrinks\nwith aversion from the sturdy, the universal, and the democratic.\n\nThe poetry of the future, (a phrase open to sharp criticism, and not\nsatisfactory to me, but significant, and I will use it)--the poetry of\nthe future aims at the free expression of emotion, (which means far, far\nmore than appears at first,) and to arouse and initiate, more than to\ndefine or finish. Like all modern tendencies, it has direct or indirect\nreference continually to the reader, to you or me, to the central\nidentity of everything, the mighty Ego. (Byron's was a vehement dash,\nwith plenty of impatient democracy, but lurid and introverted amid all\nits magnetism; not at all the fitting, lasting song of a grand, secure,\nfree, sunny race.) It is more akin, likewise, to outside life and\nlandscape, (returning mainly to the antique feeling,) real sun and gale,\nand woods and shores--to the elements themselves--not sitting at ease in\nparlor or library listening to a good tale of them, told in good rhyme.\nCharacter, a feature far above style or polish--a feature not absent at\nany time, but now first brought to the fore--gives predominant stamp to\nadvancing poetry. Its born sister, music, already responds to the same\ninfluences. \"The music of the present, Wagner's, Gounod's, even the\nlater Verdi's, all tends toward this free expression of poetic emotion,\nand demands a vocalism totally unlike that required for Rossini's\nsplendid roulades, or Bellini's suave melodies.\"\n\nIs there not even now, indeed, an evolution, a departure from the\nmasters? Venerable and unsurpassable after their kind as are the old\nworks, and always unspeakably precious as studies, (for Americans\nmore than any other people,) is it too much to say that by the\nshifted combinations of the modern mind the whole underlying theory\nof first-class verse has changed? \"Formerly, during the period term'd\nclassic,\" says Sainte-Beuve, \"when literature was govern'd by recognized\nrules, he was considered the best poet who had composed the most perfect\nwork, the most beautiful poem, the most intelligible, the most\nagreeable to read, the most complete in every respect,--the Aeneid, the\nGerusalemme, a fine tragedy. To-day, something else is wanted. For us\nthe greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's\nimagination and reflection, who excites him the most himself to poetize.\nThe greatest poet is not he who has done the best; it is he who suggests\nthe most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, and who\nleaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in\nyour turn.\"\n\nThe fatal defects our American singers labor under are subordination of\nspirit, an absence of the concrete and of real patriotism, and in excess\nthat modern esthetic contagion a queer friend of mine calls the _beauty\ndisease_. \"The immoderate taste for beauty and art,\" says Charles\nBaudelaire, \"leads men into monstrous excesses. In minds imbued with a\nfrantic greed for the beautiful, all the balances of truth and justice\ndisappear. There is a lust, a disease of the art faculties, which eats\nup the moral like a cancer.\"\n\nOf course, by our plentiful verse-writers there is plenty of service\nperform'd, of a kind. Nor need we go far for a tally. We see, in\nevery polite circle, a class of accomplished, good-natured persons,\n(\"society,\" in fact, could not get on without them,) fully eligible for\ncertain problems, times, and duties--to mix egg-nog, to mend the broken\nspectacles, to decide whether the stewed eels shall precede the sherry\nor the sherry the stewed eels, to eke out Mrs. A. B.'s parlor-tableaux\nwith monk, Jew, lover, Puck, Prospero, Caliban, or what not, and to\ngenerally contribute and gracefully adapt their flexibilities and\ntalents, in those ranges, to the world's service. But for real crises,\ngreat needs and pulls, moral or physical, they might as well have never\nbeen born.\n\nOr the accepted notion of a poet would appear to be a sort of male\nodalisque, singing or piano-playing a kind of spiced ideas, second-hand\nreminiscences, or toying late hours at entertainments, in rooms stifling\nwith fashionable scent. I think I haven't seen a new-published, healthy,\nbracing, simple lyric in ten years. Not long ago, there were verses in\neach of three fresh monthlies, from leading authors, and in every one\nthe whole central _motif_ (perfectly serious) was the melancholiness\nof a marriageable young woman who didn't get a rich husband, but a poor\none!\n\nBesides its tonic and _al fresco_ physiology, relieving such as this,\nthe poetry of the future will take on character in a more important\nrespect. Science, having extirpated the old stock-fables and\nsuperstitions, is clearing a field for verse, for all the arts, and\neven for romance, a hundred-fold ampler and more wonderful, with the new\nprinciples behind. Republicanism advances over the whole world. Liberty,\nwith Law by her side, will one day be paramount--will at any rate be\nthe central idea. Then only--for all the splendor and beauty of what has\nbeen, or the polish of what is--then only will the true poets appear,\nand the true poems. Not the satin and patchouly of today, not the\nglorification of the butcheries and wars of the past, nor any fight\nbetween Deity on one side and somebody else on the other--not Milton,\nnot even Shakspere's plays, grand as they are. Entirely different and\nhitherto unknown Classes of men, being authoritatively called for in\nimaginative literature, will certainly appear. What is hitherto most\nlacking, perhaps most absolutely indicates the future. Democracy has\nbeen hurried on through time by measureless tides and winds, resistless\nas the revolution of the globe, and as far-reaching and rapid. But in\nthe highest walks of art it has not yet had a single representative\nworthy of it anywhere upon the earth.\n\nNever had real bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than\nto sing worthily the songs these States have already indicated. Their\norigin, Washington, '76, the picturesqueness of old times, the war of\n1812 and the sea-fights; the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth\nof area--to fuse and compact the South and North, the East and West,\nto express the native forms, situations, scenes, from Montauk to\nCalifornia, and from the Saguenay to the Rio Grande--the working out on\nsuch gigantic scales, and with such a swift and mighty play of changing\nlight and shade, of the great problems of man and freedom,--how far\nahead of the stereotyped plots, or gem-cutting, or tales of love,\nor wars of mere ambition! Our history is so full of spinal, modern,\ngerminal subjects--one above all. What the ancient siege of Illium, and\nthe puissance of Hector's and Agamemnon's warriors proved to Hellenic\nart and literature, and all art and literature since, may prove the\nwar of attempted secession of 1861-'65 to the future esthetics, drama,\nromance, poems of the United States.\n\nNor could utility itself provide anything more practically serviceable\nto the hundred millions who, a couple of generations hence, will inhabit\nwithin the limits just named, than the permeation of a sane, sweet,\nautochthonous national poetry--must I say of a kind that does not now\nexist? but which, I fully believe, will in time be supplied on scales as\nfree as Nature's elements. (It is acknowledged that we of the States\nare the most materialistic and money-making people ever known. My own\ntheory, while fully accepting this, is that we are the most emotional,\nspiritualistic, and poetry-loving people also.)\n\nInfinite are the new and orbic traits waiting to be launch'd forth in\nthe firmament that is, and is to be, America. Lately, I have wonder'd\nwhether the last meaning of this cluster of thirty-eight States is not\nonly practical fraternity among themselves--the only real union, (much\nnearer its accomplishment, too, than appears on the surface)--but for\nfraternity over the whole globe--that dazzling, pensive dream of ages!\nIndeed, the peculiar glory of our lands, I have come to see, or expect\nto see, not in their geographical or republican greatness, nor wealth or\nproducts, nor military or naval power, nor special, eminent names in any\ndepartment, to shine with, or outshine, foreign special names in similar\ndepartments,--but more and more in a vaster, saner, more surrounding\nComradeship, uniting closer and closer not only the American States, but\nall nations, and all humanity. That, O poets! is not that a theme worth\nchanting, striving for? Why not fix your verses henceforth to the\ngauge of the round globe? the whole race? Perhaps the most illustrious\nculmination of the modern may thus prove to be a signal growth of\njoyous, more exalted bards of adhesiveness, identically one in soul, but\ncontributed by every nation, each after its distinctive kind. Let us,\naudacious, start it. Let the diplomats, as ever, still deeply plan,\nseeking advantages, proposing treaties between governments, and to bind\nthem, on paper: what I seek is different, simpler. I would inaugurate\nfrom America, for this purpose, new formulas--international poems. I\nhave thought that the invisible root out of which the poetry deepest in,\nand dearest to, humanity grows, is Friendship. I have thought that both\nin patriotism and song (even amid their grandest shows past) we have\nadhered too long to petty limits, and that the time has come to enfold\nthe world.\n\nNot only is the human and artificial world we have establish'd in the\nWest a radical departure from anything hitherto known--not only men and\npolitics, and all that goes with them--but Nature itself, in the main\nsense, its construction, is different. The same old font of type, of\ncourse, but set up to a text never composed or issued before. For Nature\nconsists not only in itself, objectively, but at least just as much in\nits subjective reflection from the person, spirit, age, looking at\nit, in the midst of it, and absorbing it--faithfully sends back the\ncharacteristic beliefs of the time or individual--takes, and readily\ngives again, the physiognomy of any nation or literature--falls like a\ngreat elastic veil on a face, or like the molding plaster on a statue.\n\nWhat is Nature? What were the elements, the invisible backgrounds and\neidolons of it, to Homer's heroes, voyagers, gods? What all through the\nwanderings of Virgil's Aeneas? Then to Shakspere's characters--Hamlet,\nLear, the English-Norman kings, the Romans? What was Nature to Rousseau,\nto Voltaire, to the German Goethe in his little classical court gardens?\nIn those presentments in Tennyson (see the \"Idylls of the King\"--what\nsumptuous, perfumed, arras-and-gold Nature, inimitably described, better\nthan any, fit for princes and knights and peerless ladies--wrathful or\npeaceful, just the same--Vivien and Merlin in their strange dalliance,\nor the death-float of Elaine, or Geraint and the long journey of his\ndisgraced Enid and himself through the wood, and the wife all day\ndriving the horses,) as in all the great imported art-works, treatises\nsystems, from Lucretius down, there is a constantly lurking often\npervading something, that will have to be eliminated, as not only\nunsuited to modern democracy and science in America, but insulting to\nthem, and disproved by them.[37]\n\nStill, the rule and demesne of poetry will always be not the exterior,\nbut interior; not the macrocosm, but microcosm; not Nature, but Man. I\nhaven't said anything about the imperative need of a race of giant bards\nin the future, to hold up high to eyes of land and race the eternal\nantiseptic models, and to dauntlessly confront greed, injustice, and all\nforms of that wiliness and tyranny whose roots never die--(my opinion\nis, that after all the rest is advanced, _that_ is what first-class\npoets are for; as, to their days and occasions, the Hebrew lyrists,\nRoman Juvenal, and doubtless the old singers of India, and the British\nDruids)--to counteract dangers, immensest ones, already looming in\nAmerica--measureless corruption in politics--what we call religion,\na mere mask of wax or lace;--for _ensemble_, that most cankerous,\noffensive of all earth's shows--a vast and varied community, prosperous\nand fat with wealth of money and products and business ventures--plenty\nof mere intellectuality too--and then utterly without the sound,\nprevailing, moral and esthetic health-action beyond all the money and\nmere intellect of the world.\n\nIs it a dream of mine that, in times to come, west, south, east, north,\nwill silently, surely arise a race of such poets, varied, yet one\nin soul--nor only poets, and of the best, but newer, larger\nprophets--larger than Judea's, and more passionate--to meet and\npenetrate those woes, as shafts of light the darkness?\n\nAs I write, the last fifth of the nineteenth century is enter'd upon,\nand will soon be waning. Now, and for a long time to come, what the\nUnited States most need, to give purport, definiteness, reason why, to\ntheir unprecedented material wealth, industrial products, education\nby rote merely, great populousness and intellectual activity, is the\ncentral, spinal reality, (or even the idea of it,) of such a democratic\nband of-native-born-and-bred teachers, artists, _litterateurs_, tolerant\nand receptive of importations, but entirely adjusted to the West, to\nourselves, to our own days, combinations, differences, superiorities.\nIndeed, I am fond of thinking that the whole series of concrete and\npolitical triumphs of the Republic are mainly as bases and preparations\nfor half a dozen future poets, ideal personalities, referring not to a\nspecial class, but to the entire people, four or five millions of square\nmiles.\n\nLong, long are the processes of the development of a nationality Only\nto the rapt vision does the seen become the prophecy of the unseen.[38]\nDemocracy, so far attending only to the real, is not for the real only,\nbut the grandest ideal--to justify the modern by that, and not only to\nequal, but to become by that superior to the past.\n\nOn a comprehensive summing up of the processes and present and hitherto\ncondition of the United States, with reference to their future, and\nthe indispensable precedents to it, my point, below all surfaces, and\nsubsoiling them, is, that the bases and prerequisites of a leading\nnationality are, first, at all hazards, freedom, worldly wealth and\nproducts on the largest and most varied scale, common education and\nintercommunication, and, in general, the passing through of just the\nstages and crudities we have passed or are passing through in the United\nStates.\n\nThen, perhaps, as weightiest factor of the whole business, and of the\nmain outgrowths of the future, it remains to be definitely avow'd\nthat the native-born middle-class population of quite all the United\nStates--the average of farmers and mechanics everywhere--the real,\nthough latent and silent bulk of America, city or country, presents a\nmagnificent mass of material, never before equal'd on earth. It is this\nmaterial, quite unexpress'd by literature or art, that in every respect\ninsures the future of the republic. During the secession war I was with\nthe armies, and saw the rank and file, north and south, and studied them\nfor four years. I have never had the least doubt about the country in\nits essential future since.\n\nMeantime, we can (perhaps) do no better than to saturate ourselves with,\nand continue to give imitations, yet awhile, of the esthetic models,\nsupplies, of that past and of those lands we spring from. Those wondrous\nstores, reminiscences, floods, currents! Let them flow on, flow hither\nfreely. And let the sources be enlarged, to include not only the works\nof British origin, as now, but stately and devout Spain, courteous\nFrance, profound Germany, the manly Scandinavian lands, Italy's art\nrace, and always the mystic Orient. Remembering that at present, and\ndoubtless long ahead, a certain humility would well become us. The\ncourse through time of highest civilization, does it not wait the\nfirst glimpse of our contribution to its kosmic train of poems,\nbibles, first-class structures, perpetuities--Egypt and Palestine and\nIndia--Greece and Rome and mediaeval Europe--and so onward? The shadowy\nprocession is not a meagre one, and the standard not a low one. All that\nis mighty in our kind seems to have already trod the road. Ah, never may\nAmerica forget her thanks and reverence for samples, treasures such\nas these--that other life-blood, inspiration, sunshine, hourly in use\nto-day, all days, forever, through her broad demesne!\n\nAll serves our New World progress, even the bafflers, head-winds,\ncross-tides. Through many perturbations and squalls, and much backing\nand filling, the ship, upon the whole, makes unmistakably for her\ndestination. Shakspere has served, and serves, may-be, the best of any.\n\nFor conclusion, a passing thought, a contrast, of him who, in my\nopinion, continues and stands for the Shaksperean cultus at the present\nday among all English-writing peoples--of Tennyson, his poetry. I find\nit impossible, as I taste the sweetness of those lines, to escape the\nflavor, the conviction, the lush-ripening culmination, and last honey of\ndecay (I dare not call it rottenness) of that feudalism which the\nmighty English dramatist painted in all the splendors of its noon and\nafternoon. And how they are chanted--both poets! Happy those kings and\nnobles to be so sung, so told! To run their course--to get their deeds\nand shapes in lasting pigments--the very pomp and dazzle of the sunset!\n\nMeanwhile, democracy waits the coming of its bards in silence and in\ntwilight--but 'tis the twilight of the dawn.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n[35] A few years ago I saw the question, \"Has America produced any great\npoem?\" announced as prize-subject for the competition of some university\nin Northern Europe. I saw the item in a foreign paper and made a note\nof it; but being taken down with paralysis, and prostrated for a long\nseason, the matter slipp'd away, and I have never been able since to get\nhold of any essay presented for the prize, or report of the discussion,\nnor to learn for certain whether there was any essay or discussion,\nnor can I now remember the place. It may have been Upsala, or possibly\nHeidelberg. Perhaps some German or Scandinavian can give particulars. I\nthink it was in 1872.\n\n[36] In a long and prominent editorial, at the time, on the death of\nWilliam Cullen Bryant.\n\n[37] Whatever may be said of the few principal poems--or their best\npassages--it is certain that the overwhelming mass of poetic works,\nas now absorb'd into human character, exerts a certain constipating,\nrepressing, indoor, and artificial influence, impossible to\nelude--seldom or never that freeing, dilating, joyous one, with which\nuncramp'd Nature works on every individual without exception.\n\n[38] Is there not such a thing as the philosophy of American history and\npolitics? And if so, what is it?... Wise men say there are two sets\nof wills to nations and to persons--one set that acts and works\nfrom explainable motives--from teaching, intelligence, judgment,\ncircumstance, caprice, emulation, greed, etc.--and then another set,\nperhaps deep, hidden, unsuspected, yet often more potent than the\nfirst, refusing to be argued with, rising as it were out of abysses,\nresistlessly urging on speakers, doers, communities, unwitting to\nthemselves--the poet to his fieriest words--the race to pursue its\nloftiest ideal. Indeed, the paradox of a nation's life and career, with\nall its wondrous contradictions, can probably only be explain'd from\nthese two wills, sometimes conflicting, each operating in its sphere,\ncombining in races or in persons, and producing strangest results.\n\nLet us hope there is (indeed, can there be any doubt there is?) this\ngreat unconscious and abysmic second will also running through the\naverage nationality and career of America. Let us hope that, amid all\nthe dangers and defections of the present, and through all the processes\nof the conscious will, it alone is the permanent and sovereign force,\ndestined to carry on the New World to fulfil its destinies in the\nfuture--to resolutely pursue those destinies, age upon age; to build,\nfar, far beyond its past vision, present thought; to form and fashion,\nand for the general type, men and women more noble, more athletic than\nthe world has yet seen; to gradually, firmly blend, from all the States,\nwith all varieties, a friendly, happy, free, religious nationality--a\nnationality not only the richest, most inventive, most productive and\nmaterialistic the world has yet known, but compacted indissolubly, and\nout of whose ample and solid bulk, and giving purpose and finish to it,\nconscience, morals, and all the spiritual attributes, shall surely rise,\nlike spires above some group of edifices, firm-footed on the earth, yet\nscaling space and heaven.\n\nGreat as they are, and greater far to be, the United States, too, are\nbut a series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought. And\nhere is, to my mind, their final justification, and certain perpetuity.\nThere is in that sublime process, in the laws of the universe--and,\nabove all, in the moral law--something that would make unsatisfactory,\nand even vain and contemptible, all the triumphs of war, the gains of\npeace, and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the nations that\nhave ever existed, or that (ours included) now exist, except that we\nconstantly see, through all their worldly career, however struggling and\nblind and lame, attempts, by all ages, all peoples, according to their\ndevelopment, to reach, to press, to progress on, and ever farther on, to\nmore and more advanced ideals.\n\nThe glory of the republic of the United States, in my opinion, is to be\nthat, emerging in the light of the modern and the splendor of science,\nand solidly based on the past, it is to cheerfully range itself, and its\npolitics are henceforth to come, under those universal laws, and embody\nthem, and carry them out, to serve them. And as only that individual\nbecomes truly great who understands well that, while complete in himself\nin a certain sense, he is but a part of the divine, eternal scheme, and\nwhose special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations\nwith the general laws of Nature, and especially with the moral law, the\ndeepest and highest of all, and the last vitality of man or state--so\nthe United States may only become the greatest and the most continuous,\nby understanding well their harmonious relations with entire humanity\nand history, and all their laws and progress, sublimed with the creative\nthought of Deity, through all time, past, present, and future. Thus will\nthey expand to the amplitude of their destiny, and become illustrations\nand culminating parts of the kosmos, and of civilization.\n\nNo more considering the States as an incident, or series of incidents,\nhowever vast, coming accidentally along the path of time, and shaped\nby casual emergencies as they happen to arise, and the mere result of\nmodern improvements, vulgar and lucky, ahead of other nations and times,\nI would finally plant, as seeds, these thoughts or speculations in the\ngrowth of our republic--that it is the deliberate culmination and result\nof all the past--that here, too, as in all departments of the universe,\nregular laws (slow and sure in planting, slow and sure in ripening) have\ncontroll'd and govern'd, and will yet control and govern; and that those\nlaws can no more be baffled or steer'd clear of, or vitiated, by chance,\nor any fortune or opposition, than the laws of winter and summer, or\ndarkness and light.\n\nThe summing up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of\n1861-'65, and their results--and indeed of the entire hundred years of\nthe past of our national experiment, from its inchoate movement down\nto the present day (1780-1881)--is, that they all now launch the United\nStates fairly forth, consistently with the entirety of civilization and\nhumanity, and in main sort the representative of them, leading the van,\nleading the fleet of the modern and democratic, on the seas and voyages\nof the future.\n\nAnd the real history of the United States--starting from that great\nconvulsive struggle for unity, the secession war, triumphantly\nconcluded, and _the South_ victorious after all--is only to be written\nat the remove of hundreds, perhaps a thousand, years hence.\n\n\n\n\nA MEMORANDUM AT A VENTURE\n\n\n\"All is proper to be express'd, provided our aim is only high\nenough.\"--_J. F. Millet._\n\n\"The candor of science is the glory of the modern. It does not hide\nand repress; it confronts, turns on the light. It alone has perfect\nfaith--faith not in a part only, but all. Does it not undermine the old\nreligious standards? Yes, in God's truth, by excluding the devil from\nthe theory of the universe--by showing that evil is not a law in itself,\nbut a sickness, a perversion of the good, and the other side of the\ngood--that in fact all of humanity, and of everything, is divine in its\nbases, its eligibilities.\"\n\nShall the mention of such topics as I have briefly but plainly and\nresolutely broach'd in the \"Children of Adam\" section of \"Leaves of\nGrass\" be admitted in poetry and literature? Ought not the innovation\nto be put down by opinion and criticism? and, if those fail, by the\nDistrict Attorney? True, I could not construct a poem which declaredly\ntook, as never before, the complete human identity, physical, moral,\nemotional, and intellectual, (giving precedence and compass in a certain\nsense to the first,) nor fulfil that _bona fide_ candor and entirety\nof treatment which was a part of my purpose, without comprehending this\nsection also. But I would entrench myself more deeply and widely than\nthat. And while I do not ask any man to indorse my theory, I confess\nmyself anxious that what I sought to write and express, and the ground I\nbuilt on, shall be at least partially understood, from its own platform.\nThe best way seems to me to confront the question with entire frankness.\n\nThere are, generally speaking, two points of view, two conditions of the\nworld's attitude toward these matters; the first, the conventional one\nof good folks and good print everywhere, repressing any direct statement\nof them, and making allusions only at second or third hand--(as\nthe Greeks did of death, which, in Hellenic social culture, was not\nmention'd point-blank, but by euphemisms.) In the civilization of\nto-day, this condition--without stopping to elaborate the arguments and\nfacts, which are many and varied and perplexing--has led to states of\nignorance, repressal, and cover'd over disease and depletion,\nforming certainly a main factor in the world's woe. A nonscientific,\nnon-esthetic, and eminently non-religious condition, bequeath'd to us\nfrom the past, (its origins diverse, one of them the far-back lessons\nof benevolent and wise men to restrain the prevalent coarseness and\nanimality of the tribal ages--with Puritanism, or perhaps Protestantism\nitself for another, and still another specified in the latter part\nof this memorandum)--to it is probably due most of the ill births,\ninefficient maturity, snickering pruriency, and of that human pathologic\nevil and morbidity which is, in my opinion, the keel and reason-why of\nevery evil and morbidity. Its scent, as of something sneaking,\nfurtive, mephitic, seems to lingeringly pervade all modern literature,\nconversation, and manners.\n\nThe second point of view, and by far the largest--as the world in\nworking-day dress vastly exceeds the world in parlor toilette--is\nthe one of common life, from the oldest times down, and especially in\nEngland, (see the earlier chapters of \"Taine's English Literature,\" and\nsee Shakspere almost anywhere,) and which our age to-day inherits from\nriant stock, in the wit, or what passes for wit, of masculine circles,\nand in erotic stories and talk, to excite, express, and dwell on, that\nmerely sensual voluptuousness which, according to Victor Hugo, is the\nmost universal trait of all ages, all lands. This second condition,\nhowever bad, is at any rate like a disease which comes to the surface,\nand therefore less dangerous than a conceal'd one.\n\nThe time seems to me to have arrived, and America to be the place, for\na new departure--a third point of view. The same freedom and faith and\nearnestness which, after centuries of denial, struggle, repression,\nand martyrdom, the present day brings to the treatment of politics and\nreligion, must work out a plan and standard on this subject, not so\nmuch for what is call'd society, as for thoughtfulest men and women, and\nthoughtfulest literature. The same spirit that marks the physiological\nauthor and demonstrator on these topics in his important field, I have\nthought necessary to be exemplified, for once, in another certainly not\nless important field.\n\nIn the present memorandum I only venture to indicate that plan and\nview--decided upon more than twenty years ago, for my own literary\naction, and formulated tangibly in my printed poems--(as Bacon says an\nabstract thought or theory is of no moment unless it leads to a deed or\nwork done, exemplifying it in the concrete)--that the sexual passion\nin itself, while normal and unperverted, is inherently legitimate,\ncreditable, not necessarily an improper theme for poet, as confessedly\nnot for scientist--that, with reference to the whole construction,\norganism, and intentions of \"Leaves of Grass,\" anything short of\nconfronting that theme, and making myself clear upon it as the enclosing\nbasis of everything, (as the sanity of everything was to be the\natmosphere of the poems,) I should beg the question in its most\nmomentous aspect, and the superstructure that follow'd, pretensive as\nit might assume to be, would all rest on a poor foundation, or no\nfoundation at all. In short, as the assumption of the sanity of birth,\nNature and humanity, is the key to any true theory of life and the\nuniverse--at any rate, the only theory out of which I wrote--it is, and\nmust inevitably be, the only key to \"Leaves of Grass,\" and every part\nof it. _That_, (and not a vain consistency or weak pride, as a late\n\"Springfield Republican\" charges,) is the reason that I have stood out\nfor these particular verses uncompromisingly for over twenty years, and\nmaintain them to this day. _That_ is what I felt in my inmost brain and\nheart, when I only answer'd Emerson's vehement arguments with silence,\nunder the old elms of Boston Common.\n\nIndeed, might not every physiologist and every good physician pray\nfor the redeeming of this subject from its hitherto relegation to the\ntongues and pens of blackguards, and boldly putting it for once at\nleast, if no more, in the demesne of poetry and sanity--as something not\nin itself gross or impure, but entirely consistent with highest manhood\nand womanhood, and indispensable to both? Might not only every wife and\nevery mother--not only every babe that comes into the world, if that\nwere possible--not only all marriage, the foundation and _sine qua\nnon_ of the civilized state--bless and thank the showing, or taking for\ngranted, that motherhood, fatherhood, sexuality, and all that belongs\nto them, can be asserted, where it comes to question, openly, joyously,\nproudly, \"without shame or the need of shame,\" from the highest artistic\nand human considerations--but, with reverence be it written, on such\nattempt to justify the base and start of the whole divine scheme in\nhumanity, might not the Creative Power itself deign a smile of approval?\n\nTo the movement for the eligibility and entrance of women amid new\nspheres of business, politics, and the suffrage, the current prurient,\nconventional treatment of sex is the main formidable obstacle. The\nrising tide of \"woman's rights,\" swelling and every year advancing\nfarther and farther, recoils from it with dismay. There will in my\nopinion be no general progress in such eligibility till a sensible,\nphilosophic, democratic method is substituted.\n\nThe whole question--which strikes far, very far deeper than most people\nhave supposed, (and doubtless, too, something is to be said on all\nsides,) is peculiarly an important one in art--is first an ethic, and\nthen still more an esthetic one. I condense from a paper read not long\nsince at Cheltenham, England, before the \"Social Science Congress,\" to\nthe Art Department, by P. H. Rathbone of Liverpool, on the \"Undraped\nFigure in Art,\" and the discussion that follow'd:\n\n\"When coward Europe suffer'd the unclean Turk to soil the sacred shores\nof Greece by his polluting presence, civilization and morality receiv'd\na blow from which they have never entirely recover'd, and the trail of\nthe serpent has been over European art and European society ever since.\nThe Turk regarded and regards women as animals without soul, toys to be\nplay'd with or broken at pleasure, and to be hidden, partly from shame,\nbut chiefly for the purpose of stimulating exhausted passion. Such is\nthe unholy origin of the objection to the nude as a fit subject for art;\nit is purely Asiatic, and though not introduced for the first time\nin the fifteenth century, is yet to be traced to the source of all\nimpurity--the East. Although the source of the prejudice is thoroughly\nunhealthy and impure, yet it is now shared by many pure-minded and\nhonest, if somewhat uneducated, people. But I am prepared to maintain\nthat it is necessary for the future of English art and of English\nmorality that the right of the nude to a place in our galleries should\nbe boldly asserted; it must, however, be the nude as represented by\nthoroughly trained artists, and with a pure and noble ethic purpose. The\nhuman form, male and female, is the type and standard of all beauty of\nform and proportion, and it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar with\nit in order safely to judge of all beauty which consists of form and\nproportion. To women it is most necessary that they should become\nthoroughly imbued with the knowledge of the ideal female form, in order\nthat they should recognize the perfection of it at once, and without\neffort, and so far as possible avoid deviations from the ideal. Had\nthis been the case in times past, we should not have had to deplore the\ndistortions effected by tight-lacing, which destroy'd the figure and\nruin'd the health of so many of the last generation. Nor should we have\nhad the scandalous dresses alike of society and the stage. The extreme\ndevelopment of the low dresses which obtain'd some years ago, when the\nstays crush'd up the breasts into suggestive prominence, would surely\nhave been check'd, had the eye of the public been properly educated by\nfamiliarity with the exquisite beauty of line of a well-shaped bust.\nI might show how thorough acquaintance with the ideal nude foot would\nprobably have much modified the foot-torturing boots and high heels,\nwhich wring the foot out of all beauty of line, and throw the body\nforward into an awkward and ungainly attitude.\n\nIt is argued that the effect of nude representation of women upon young\nmen is unwholesome, but it would not be so if such works were admitted\nwithout question into our galleries, and became thoroughly familiar\nto them. On the contrary, it would do much to clear away from\nhealthy-hearted lads one of their sorest trials--that prurient curiosity\nwhich is bred of prudish concealment. Where there is mystery there is\nthe suggestion of evil, and to go to a theatre, where you have only to\nlook at the stalls to see one-half of the female form, and to the\nstage to see the other half undraped, is far more pregnant with evil\nimaginings than the most objectionable of totally undraped figures. In\nFrench art there have been questionable nude figures exhibited; but the\nfault was not that they were nude, but that they were the portraits\nof ugly immodest women. Some discussion follow'd. There was a general\nconcurrence in the principle contended for by the reader of the paper.\nSir Walter Stirling maintain'd that the perfect male figure, rather than\nthe female, was the model of beauty. After a few remarks from Rev. Mr.\nRoberts and Colonel Oldfield, the Chairman regretted that no opponent of\nnude figures had taken part in the discussion. He agreed with Sir\nWalter Stirling as to the male figure being the most perfect model of\nproportion. He join'd in defending the exhibition of nude figures,\nbut thought considerable supervision should be exercis'd over such\nexhibitions.\n\nNo, it is not the picture or nude statue or text, with clear aim, that\nis indecent; it is the beholder's own thought, inference, distorted\nconstruction. True modesty is one of the most precious of attributes,\neven virtues, but in nothing is there more pretense, more falsity, than\nthe needless assumption of it. Through precept and consciousness, man\nhas long enough realized how bad he is. I would not so much disturb or\ndemolish that conviction, only to resume and keep unerringly with it the\nspinal meaning of the Scriptural text, _God overlook'd all that He had\nmade_, (including the apex of the whole--humanity--with its elements,\npassions, appetites,) _and behold, it was very good_.\"\n\nDoes not anything short of that third point of view, when you come to\nthink of it profoundly and with amplitude, impugn Creation from the\noutset? In fact, however overlaid, or unaware of itself, does not\nthe conviction involv'd in it perennially exist at the centre of\nall society, and of the sexes, and of marriage? Is it not really an\nintuition of the human race? For, old as the world is, and beyond\nstatement as are the countless and splendid results of its culture and\nevolution, perhaps the best and earliest and purest intuitions of the\nhuman race have yet to be develop'd.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEATH OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN LECTURE\n\n_deliver'd in New York, April 14, 1879--in Philadelphia, '80--in Boston,\n'81_\n\n\nHow often since that dark and dripping Saturday--that chilly April day,\nnow fifteen years bygone--my heart has entertain'd the dream, the\nwish, to give of Abraham Lincoln's death, its own special thought and\nmemorial. Yet now the sought-for opportunity offers, I find my notes\nincompetent, (why, for truly profound themes, is statement so idle? why\ndoes the right phrase never offer?) and the fit tribute I dream'd of,\nwaits unprepared as ever. My talk here indeed is less because of itself\nor anything in it, and nearly altogether because I feel a desire, apart\nfrom any talk, to specify the day, the martyrdom. It is for this, my\nfriends, I have call'd you together. Oft as the rolling years bring\nback this hour, let it again, however briefly, be dwelt upon. For my\nown part, I hope and desire, till my own dying day, whenever the 14th\nor 15th of April comes, to annually gather a few friends, and hold its\ntragic reminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence. It belongs\nto these States in their entirety--not the North only, but the\nSouth--perhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South, of\nall; for there, really, this man's birth-stock. There and thence\nhis antecedent stamp. Why should I not say that thence his manliest\ntraits--his universality--his canny, easy ways and words upon the\nsurface--his inflexible determination and courage at heart? Have you\nnever realized it, my friends, that Lincoln, though grafted on the West,\nis essentially, in personnel and character, a Southern contribution?\n\nAnd though by no means proposing to resume the secession war to-night,\nI would briefly remind you of the public conditions preceding that\ncontest. For twenty years, and especially during the four or five before\nthe war actually began, the aspect of affairs in the United States,\nthough without the flash of military excitement, presents more than\nthe survey of a battle, or any extended campaign, or series, even of\nNature's convulsions. The hot passions of the South--the strange\nmixture at the North of inertia, incredulity, and conscious power--the\nincendiarism of the abolitionists--the rascality and grip of the\npoliticians, unparallel'd in any land, any age. To these I must not omit\nadding the honesty of the essential bulk of the people everywhere--yet\nwith all the seething fury and contradiction of their natures more\narous'd than the Atlantic's waves in wildest equinox. In politics, what\ncan be more ominous, (though generally unappreciated then)--what more\nsignificant than the Presidentiads of Fillmore and Buchanan? proving\nconclusively that the weakness and wickedness of elected rulers are\njust as likely to afflict us here, as in the countries of the Old World,\nunder their monarchies, emperors, and aristocracies. In that Old World\nwere everywhere heard underground rumblings, that died out, only to\nagain surely return. While in America the volcano, though civic yet,\ncontinued to grow more and more convulsive--more and more stormy and\nthreatening.\n\nIn the height of all this excitement and chaos, hovering on the edge at\nfirst, and then merged in its very midst, and destined to play a leading\npart, appears a strange and awkward figure. I shall not easily forget\nthe first time I ever saw Abraham Lincoln. It must have been about the\n18th or 19th of February, 1861. It was rather a pleasant afternoon, in\nNew York city, as he arrived there from the West, to remain a few hours,\nand then pass on to Washington, to prepare for his inauguration. I saw\nhim in Broadway, near the site of the present Post-office. He came down,\nI think from Canal street, to stop at the Astor House. The broad spaces,\nsidewalks, and street in the neighborhood, and for some distance, were\ncrowded with solid masses of people, many thousands. The omnibuses and\nother vehicles had all been turn'd off, leaving an unusual hush in that\nbusy part of the city. Presently two or three shabby hack barouches made\ntheir way with some difficulty through the crowd, and drew up at the\nAstor House entrance. A tall figure stepp'd out of the centre of these\nbarouches, paus'd leisurely on the sidewalk, look'd up at the granite\nwalls and looming architecture of the grand old hotel--then, after a\nrelieving stretch of arms and legs, turn'd round for over a minute to\nslowly and good-humoredly scan the appearance of the vast and silent\ncrowds. There were no speeches--no compliments--no welcome--as far as\nI could hear, not a word said. Still much anxiety was conceal'd in that\nquiet. Cautious persons had fear'd some mark'd insult or indignity to\nthe President-elect--for he possess'd no personal popularity at all in\nNew York city, and very little political. But it was evidently tacitly\nagreed that if the few political supporters of Mr. Lincoln present\nwould entirely abstain from any demonstration on their side, the immense\nmajority, who were anything but supporters, would abstain on their side\nalso. The result was a sulky, unbroken silence, such as certainly never\nbefore characterized so great a New York crowd.\n\nAlmost in the same neighborhood I distinctly remember'd seeing Lafayette\non his visit to America in 1825. I had also personally seen and heard,\nvarious years afterward, how Andrew Jackson, Clay, Webster, Hungarian\nKossuth, Filibuster Walker, the Prince of Wales on his visit, and\nother celebres, native and foreign, had been welcom'd there--all that\nindescribable human roar and magnetism, unlike any other sound in the\nuniverse--the glad exulting thunder-shouts of countless unloos'd throats\nof men! But on this occasion, not a voice--not a sound. From the top of\nan omnibus, (driven up one side, close by, and block'd by the curbstone\nand the crowds,) I had, I say, a capital view of it all, and\nespecially of Mr. Lincoln, his look and gait--his perfect composure and\ncoolness--his unusual and uncouth height, his dress of complete black,\nstovepipe hat push'd back on the head, dark-brown complexion, seam'd\nand wrinkled yet canny-looking face, black, bushy head of hair,\ndisproportionately long neck, and his hands held behind as he stood\nobserving the people. He look'd with curiosity upon that immense sea of\nfaces, and the sea of faces return'd the look with similar curiosity. In\nboth there was a dash of comedy, almost farce, such as Shakspere puts in\nhis blackest tragedies. The crowd that hemm'd around consisted I should\nthink of thirty to forty thousand men, not a single one his personal\nfriend--while I have no doubt, (so frenzied were the ferments of\nthe time,) many an assassin's knife and pistol lurk'd in hip or\nbreast-pocket there, ready, soon as break and riot came.\n\nBut no break or riot came. The tall figure gave another relieving\nstretch or two of arms and legs; then with moderate pace, and\naccompanied by a few unknown-looking persons, ascended the portico-steps\nof the Astor House, disappear'd through its broad entrance--and the\ndumb-show ended.\n\nI saw Abraham Lincoln often the four years following that date. He\nchanged rapidly and much during his Presidency--but this scene, and him\nin it, are indelibly stamp'd upon my recollection. As I sat on the top\nof my omnibus, and had a good view of him, the thought, dim and inchoate\nthen, has since come out clear enough, that four sorts of genius, four\nmighty and primal hands, will be needed to the complete limning of this\nman's future portrait--the eyes and brains and finger-touch of Plutarch\nand Eschylus and Michel Angelo, assisted by Rabelais.\n\nAnd now--(Mr. Lincoln passing on from this scene to Washington, where\nhe was inaugurated, amid armed cavalry, and sharpshooters at every\npoint--the first instance of the kind in our history--and I hope it will\nbe the last)--now the rapid succession of well-known events, (too\nwell known--I believe, these days, we almost hate to hear them\nmention'd)--the national flag fired on at Sumter--the uprising of the\nNorth, in paroxysms of astonishment and rage--the chaos of divided\ncouncils--the call for troops--the first Bull Run--the stunning\ncast-down, shock, and dismay of the North--and so in full flood the\nsecession war. Four years of lurid, bleeding, murky, murderous war.\nWho paint those years, with all their scenes?--the hard-fought\nengagements--the defeats, plans, failures--the gloomy hours, days,\nwhen our Nationality seem'd hung in pall of doubt, perhaps death--the\nMephistophelean sneers of foreign lands and attaches--the dreaded\nScylla of European interference, and the Charybdis of the tremendously\ndangerous latent strata of secession sympathizers throughout the free\nStates, (far more numerous than is supposed)--the long marches\nin summer--the hot sweat, and many a sunstroke, as on the rush to\nGettysburg in '63--the night battles in the woods, as under Hooker\nat Chancellorsville--the camps in winter--the military prisons--the\nhospitals--(alas! alas! the hospitals.)\n\nThe secession war? Nay, let me call it the Union war. Though\nwhatever call'd, it is even yet too near us--too vast and too closely\novershadowing--its branches unform'd yet, (but certain,) shooting too\nfar into the future--and the most indicative and mightiest of them yet\nungrown. A great literature will yet arise out of the era of those\nfour years, those scenes--era compressing centuries of native passion,\nfirst-class pictures, tempests of life and death--an inexhaustible mine\nfor the histories, drama, romance, and even philosophy, of peoples to\ncome--indeed the verteber of poetry and art, (of personal character\ntoo,) for all future America--far more grand, in my opinion, to the\nhands capable of it, than Homer's siege of Troy, or the French wars to\nShakspere.\n\nBut I must leave these speculations, and come to the theme I have\nassign'd and limited myself to. Of the actual murder of President\nLincoln, though so much has been written, probably the facts are yet\nvery indefinite in most persons' minds. I read from my memoranda,\nwritten at the time, and revised frequently and finally since.\n\nThe day, April 14, 1865, seems to have been a pleasant one throughout\nthe whole land--the moral atmosphere pleasant too--the long storm, so\ndark, so fratricidal, full of blood and doubt and gloom, over and ended\nat last by the sun-rise of such an absolute National victory, and utter\nbreak-down of Secessionism--we almost doubted our own senses! Lee had\ncapitulated beneath the apple-tree of Appomattox. The other armies, the\nflanges of the revolt, swiftly follow'd. And could it really be, then?\nOut of all the affairs of this world of woe and failure and disorder,\nwas there really come the confirm'd, unerring sign of plan, like a\nshaft of pure light--of rightful rule--of God? So the day, as I say, was\npropitious. Early herbage, early flowers, were out. (I remember where\nI was stopping at the time, the season being advanced, there were many\nlilacs in full bloom. By one of those caprices that enter and give tinge\nto events without being at all a part of them, I find myself always\nreminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and odor of these\nblossoms. It never fails.)\n\nBut I must not dwell on accessories. The deed hastens. The popular\nafternoon paper of Washington, the little \"Evening Star,\" had spatter'd\nall over its third page, divided among the advertisements in a\nsensational manner, in a hundred different places, _The President and\nhis Lady will be at the Theatre this evening_.... (Lincoln was fond\nof the theatre. I have myself seen him there several times. I remember\nthinking how funny it was that he, in some respects the leading actor\nin the stormiest drama known to real history's stage through centuries,\nshould sit there and be so completely interested and absorb'd in those\nhuman jack-straws, moving about with their silly little gestures,\nforeign spirit, and flatulent text.)\n\nOn this occasion the theatre was crowded, many ladies in rich and gay\ncostumes, officers in their uniforms, many well-known citizens, young\nfolks, the usual clusters of gas-lights, the usual magnetism of so many\npeople, cheerful, with perfumes, music of violins and flutes--(and\nover all, and saturating all, that vast, vague wonder, _Victory_,\nthe nation's victory, the triumph of the Union, filling the air, the\nthought, the sense, with exhilaration more than all music and perfumes.)\n\nThe President came betimes, and, with his wife, witness'd the play\nfrom the large stage-boxes of the second tier, two thrown into one,\nand profusely drap'd with the national flag. The acts and scenes of the\npiece--one of those singularly written compositions which have at least\nthe merit of giving entire relief to an audience engaged in mental\naction or business excitements and cares during the day, as it makes\nnot the slightest call on either the moral, emotional, esthetic, or\nspiritual nature--a piece, (\"Our American Cousin,\") in which, among\nother characters, so call'd, a Yankee, certainly such a one as was never\nseen, or the least like it ever seen, in North America, is introduced\nin England, with a varied fol-de-rol of talk, plot, scenery, and such\nphantasmagoria as goes to make up a modern popular drama--had progress'd\nthrough perhaps a couple of its acts, when in the midst of this comedy,\nor non-such, or whatever it is to be call'd, and to offset it, or finish\nit out, as if in Nature's and the great Muse's mockery of those poor\nmimes, came interpolated that scene, not really or exactly to be\ndescribed at all, (for on the many hundreds who were there it seems\nto this hour to have left a passing blur, a dream, a blotch)--and yet\npartially to be described as I now proceed to give it. There is a scene\nin the play representing a modern parlor in which two unprecedented\nEnglish ladies are inform'd by the impossible Yankee that he is not\na man of fortune, and therefore undesirable for marriage-catching\npurposes; after which, the comments being finish'd, the dramatic trio\nmake exit, leaving the stage clear for a moment. At this period came the\nmurder of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nGreat as all its manifold train, circling round it, and stretching into\nthe future for many a century, in the politics, history, art, &c.,\nof the New World, in point of fact the main thing, the actual\nmurder, transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any commonest\noccurrence--the bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation,\nfor instance. Through the general hum following the stage pause, with\nthe change of positions, came the muffled sound of a pistol-shot, which\nnot one-hundredth part of the audience heard at the time--and yet a\nmoment's hush--somehow, surely, a vague startled thrill--and then,\nthrough the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the\nPresident's box, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands\nand feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage, (a\ndistance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet,) falls out of position,\ncatching his boot-heel in the copious drapery, (the American flag,)\nfalls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing had\nhappen'd, (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt then)--and so\nthe figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black broadcloth,\nbare-headed, with full, glossy, raven hair, and his eyes like some mad\nanimal's flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange\ncalmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife--walks along not much\nback from the footlights--turns fully toward the audience his face\nof statuesque beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with\ndesperation, perhaps insanity--launches out in a firm and steady voice\nthe words _Sic semper tyrannis_--and then walks with neither slow\nnor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage, and\ndisappears. (Had not all this terrible scene--making the mimic ones\npreposterous--had it not all been rehears'd, in blank, by Booth,\nbeforehand?)\n\nA moment's hush--a scream--the cry of _murder_--Mrs. Lincoln leaning out\nof the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing\nto the retreating figure, _He has kill'd the President._ And still a\nmoment's strange, incredulous suspense--and then the deluge!--then that\nmixture of horror, noises, uncertainty--(the sound, somewhere back, of\na horse's hoofs clattering with speed)--the people burst through chairs\nand railings, and break them up--there is inextricable confusion\nand terror--women faint--quite feeble persons fall, and are trampl'd\non--many cries of agony are heard--the broad stage suddenly fills\nto suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible\ncarnival--the audience rush generally upon it, at least the strong men\ndo--the actors and actresses are all there in their play-costumes and\npainted faces, with mortal fright showing through the rouge--the screams\nand calls, confused talk--redoubled, trebled--two or three manage to\npass up water from the stage to the President's box--others try to\nclamber up--&c., &c.\n\nIn the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's guard,\nwith others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in--(some two hundred\naltogether)--they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially\nthe upper ones, inflam'd with fury, literally charging the audience with\nfix'd bayonets, muskets and pistols, snouting _Clear out! clear out!\nyou sons of_----.... Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather,\ninside the play-house that night.\n\nOutside, too, in the atmosphere of shock and craze, crowds of people,\nfill'd with frenzy, ready to seize any outlet for it, come near\ncommitting murder several times on innocent individuals. One such case\nwas especially exciting. The infuriated crowd, through some chance, got\nstarted against one man, either for words he utter'd, or perhaps without\nany cause at all, and were proceeding at once to actually hang him on\na neighboring lamp-post, when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen,\nwho placed him in their midst, and fought their way slowly and amid\ngreat peril toward the station house. It was a fitting episode of the\nwhole affair. The crowd rushing and eddying to and fro--the night,\nthe yells, the pale faces, many frighten'd people trying in vain to\nextricate themselves--the attack'd man, not yet freed from the jaws\nof death, looking like a corpse--the silent, resolute, half-dozen\npolicemen, with no weapons but their little clubs, yet stern and steady\nthrough all those eddying swarms--made a fitting side-scene to the grand\ntragedy of the murder. They gain'd the station house with the protected\nman, whom they placed in security for the night, and discharged him in\nthe morning.\n\nAnd in the midst of that pandemonium, infuriated soldiers, the audience\nand the crowd, the stage, and all its actors and actresses, its\npaint-pots, spangles, and gas-lights--the life blood from those veins,\nthe best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze\nalready begins its little bubbles on the lips.\n\nThus the visible incidents and surroundings of Abraham Lincoln's murder,\nas they really occur'd. Thus ended the attempted secession of these\nStates; thus the four years' war. But the main things come subtly\nand invisibly afterward, perhaps long afterward--neither military,\npolitical, nor (great as those are,) historical. I say, certain\nsecondary and indirect results, out of the tragedy of this death, are,\nin my opinion, greatest. Not the event of the murder itself. Not that\nMr. Lincoln strings the principal points and personages of the\nperiod, like beads, upon the single string of his career. Not that his\nidiosyncrasy, in its sudden appearance and disappearance, stamps this\nRepublic with a stamp more mark'd and enduring than any yet given by\nany one man--(more even than Washington's;)--but, join'd with these,\nthe immeasurable value and meaning of that whole tragedy lies, to me,\nin senses finally dearest to a nation, (and here all our own)--the\nimaginative and artistic senses--the literary and dramatic ones. Not in\nany common or low meaning of those terms, but a meaning precious to the\nrace, and to every age. A long and varied series of contradictory\nevents arrives at last at its highest poetic, single, central, pictorial\ndenouement. The whole involved, baffling, multiform whirl of the\nsecession period comes to a head, and is gather'd in one brief flash of\nlightning-illumination--one simple, fierce deed. Its sharp culmination,\nand as it were solution, of so many bloody and angry problems,\nillustrates those climax-moments on the stage of universal Time, where\nthe historic Muse at one entrance, and the tragic Muse at the other,\nsuddenly ringing down the curtain, close an immense act in the long\ndrama of creative thought, and give it radiation, tableau, stranger than\nfiction. Fit radiation--fit close! How the imagination--how the student\nloves these things! America, too, is to have them. For not in all\ngreat deaths, nor far or near--not Caesar in the Roman senate-house,\nor Napoleon passing away in the wild night-storm at St. Helena--not\nPaleologus, falling, desperately fighting, piled over dozens deep with\nGrecian corpses--not calm old Socrates, drinking the hemlock--outvies\nthat terminus of the secession war, in one man's life, here in our\nmidst, in our own time--that seal of the emancipation of three million\nslaves--that parturition and delivery of our at last really free\nRepublic, born again, henceforth to commence its career of genuine\nhomogeneous Union, compact, consistent with itself.\n\nNor will ever future American Patriots and Unionists, indifferently over\nthe whole land, or North or South, find a better moral to their lesson.\nThe final use of the greatest men of a Nation is, after all, not with\nreference to their deeds in themselves, or their direct bearing on their\ntimes or lands. The final use of a heroic-eminent life--especially of a\nheroic-eminent death--is its indirect filtering into the nation and the\nrace, and to give, often at many removes, but unerringly, age after age,\ncolor and fibre to the personalism of the youth and maturity of that\nage, and of mankind. Then there is a cement to the whole people,\nsubtler, more underlying, than any thing in written constitution, or\ncourts or armies--namely, the cement of a death identified thoroughly\nwith that people, at its head, and for its sake. Strange, (is it not?)\nthat battles, martyrs, agonies, blood, even assassination, should so\ncondense--perhaps only really, lastingly condense--a Nationality.\n\nI repeat it--the grand deaths of the race--the dramatic deaths of every\nnationality--are its most important inheritance-value--in some respects\nbeyond its literature and art--(as the hero is beyond his finest\nportrait, and the battle itself beyond its choicest song or epic.) Is\nnot here indeed the point underlying all tragedy? the famous pieces of\nthe Grecian masters--and all masters? Why, if the old Greeks had had\nthis man, what trilogies of plays--what epics--would have been made\nout of him! How the rhapsodes would have recited him! How quickly that\nquaint tall form would have enter'd into the region where men vitalize\ngods, and gods divinify men! But Lincoln, his times, his death--great\nas any, any age--belong altogether to our own, and our autochthonic.\n(Sometimes indeed I think our American days, our own stage--the actors\nwe know and have shaken hands, or talk'd with--more fateful than\nanything in Eschylus--more heroic than the fighters around Troy--afford\nkings of men for our Democracy prouder than Agamemnon--models of\ncharacter cute and hardy as Ulysses--deaths more pitiful than Priam's.)\n\nWhen, centuries hence, (as it must, in my opinion, be centuries hence\nbefore the life of these States, or of Democracy, can be really written\nand illustrated,) the leading historians and dramatists seek for some\npersonage, some special event, incisive enough to mark with deepest\ncut, and mnemonize, this turbulent Nineteenth century of ours, (not only\nthese States, but all over the political and social world)--something,\nperhaps, to close that gorgeous procession of European feudalism, with\nall its pomp and caste-prejudices, (of whose long train we in America\nare yet so inextricably the heirs)--something to identify with terrible\nidentification, by far the greatest revolutionary step in the history of\nthe United States, (perhaps the greatest of the world, our century)--the\nabsolute extirpation and erasure of slavery from the States--those\nhistorians will seek in vain for any point to serve more thoroughly\ntheir purpose, than Abraham Lincoln's death.\n\nDear to the Muse--thrice dear to Nationality--to the whole human\nrace--precious to this Union--precious to Democracy--unspeakably and\nforever precious--their first great Martyr Chief.\n\n\n\n\nTWO LETTERS\n\nI\n\n\nTO -- -- -- LONDON, ENGLAND\n\n_Camden, N.J., U.S. America, March 17th, 1876._ DEAR FRIEND:--Yours of\nthe 28th Feb. receiv'd, and indeed welcom'd. I am jogging along still\nabout the same in physical condition--still certainly no worse, and I\nsometimes lately suspect rather better, or at any rate more adjusted to\nthe situation. Even begin to think of making some move, some change of\nbase, &c.: the doctors have been advising it for over two years, but I\nhaven't felt to do it yet. My paralysis does not lift--I cannot walk\nany distance--I still have this baffling, obstinate, apparently chronic\naffection of the stomachic apparatus and liver: yet I get out of doors\na little every day--write and read in moderation--appetite sufficiently\ngood--(eat only very plain food, but always did that)--digestion\ntolerable--spirits unflagging. I have told you most of this before, but\nsuppose you might like to know it all again, up to date. Of course, and\npretty darkly coloring the whole, are bad spells, prostrations,\nsome pretty grave ones, intervals--and I have resign'd myself to the\ncertainty of permanent incapacitation from solid work: but things may\ncontinue at least in this half-and-half way for months, even years.\n\nMy books are out, the new edition; a set of which, immediately on\nreceiving your letter of 28th, I have sent you, (by mail, March 15,)\nand I suppose you have before this receiv'd them. My dear friend, your\noffers of help, and those of my other British friends, I think I fully\nappreciate, in the right spirit, welcome and acceptive--leaving the\nmatter altogether in your and their hands, and to your and their\nconvenience, discretion, leisure, and nicety. Though poor now, even to\npenury, I have not so far been deprived of any physical thing I need or\nwish whatever, and I feel confident I shall not in the future. During my\nemployment of seven years or more in Washington after the war (1865-'72)\nI regularly saved part of my wages: and, though the sum has now become\nabout exhausted by my expenses of the last three years, there are\nalready beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales\nof my new edition, which I just job and sell, myself, (all through this\nillness, my book-agents for three years in New York successively, badly\ncheated me,) and shall continue to dispose of the books myself. And that\nis the way I should prefer to glean my support. In that way I cheerfully\naccept all the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer.\n\nTo repeat a little, and without undertaking details, understand, dear\nfriend, for yourself and all, that I heartily and most affectionately\nthank my British friends, and that I accept their sympathetic generosity\nin the same spirit in which I believe (nay, know) it is offer'd--that\nthough poor I am not in want--that I maintain good heart and cheer; and\nthat by far the most satisfaction to me (and I think it can be done, and\nbelieve it will be) will be to live, as long as possible, on the sales,\nby myself, of my own works, and perhaps, if practicable, by further\nwritings for the press.\n\nW. W.\n\nI am prohibited from writing too much, and I must make this candid\nstatement of the situation serve for all my dear friends over there.\n\n\nII\n\n\nTO -- -- -- DRESDEN, SAXONY\n\n_Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A., Dec. 20, '81._ DEAR SIR:--Your letter\nasking definite endorsement to your translation of my \"Leaves of Grass\"\ninto Russian is just received, and I hasten to answer it. Most warmly\nand willingly I consent to the translation, and waft a prayerful God\nspeed to the enterprise.\n\nYou Russians and we Americans! Our countries so distant, so unlike at\nfirst glance--such a difference in social and political conditions,\nand our respective methods of moral and practical development the\nlast hundred years;--and yet in certain features, and vastest ones, so\nresembling each other. The variety of stock-elements and tongues, to\nbe resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazards--the\nidea, perennial through the ages, that they both have their historic and\ndivine mission--the fervent element of manly friendship throughout\nthe whole people, surpass'd by no other races--the grand expanse of\nterritorial limits and boundaries--the unform'd and nebulous state of\nmany things, not yet permanently settled, but agreed on all hands to\nbe the preparations of an infinitely greater future--the fact that both\nPeoples have their independent and leading positions to hold, keep, and\nif necessary, fight for, against the rest of the world--the deathless\naspirations at the inmost centre of each great community, so vehement,\nso mysterious, so abysmic--are certainly features you Russians and\nwe Americans possess in common. As my dearest dream is for an\ninternationality of poems and poets binding the lands of the earth\ncloser than all treaties and diplomacy--as the purpose beneath the rest\nin my book is such hearty comradeship, for individuals to begin with,\nand for all the nations of the earth as a result--how happy I should be\nto get the hearing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples.\n\nTo whom, now and here, (addressing you for Russia and Russians and\nempowering you, should you see fit, to print the present letter, in your\nbook, as a preface,) I waft affectionate salutation from these shores,\nin America's name.\n\nW. W.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES LEFT OVER\n\n\nNATIONALITY--(AND YET) It is more and more clear to me that the main\nsustenance for highest separate personality, these States, is to come\nfrom that general sustenance of the aggregate, (as air, earth, rains,\ngive sustenance to a tree)--and that such personality, by democratic\nstandards, will only be fully coherent, grand and free, through the\ncohesion, grandeur and freedom of the common aggregate, the Union. Thus\nthe existence of the true American continental solidarity of the future,\ndepending on myriads of superb, large-sized, emotional and physically\nperfect individualities, of one sex just as much as the other, the\nsupply of such individualities, in my opinion, wholly depends on\na compacted imperial ensemble. The theory and practice of both\nsovereignties, contradictory as they are, are necessary. As the\ncentripetal law were fatal alone, or the centrifugal law deadly and\ndestructive alone, but together forming the law of eternal kosmical\naction, evolution, preservation, and life--so, by itself alone, the\nfullness of individuality, even the sanest, would surely destroy itself.\nThis is what makes the importance to the identities of these States\nof the thoroughly fused, relentless, dominating Union--a moral and\nspiritual idea, subjecting all the parts with remorseless power, more\nneeded by American democracy than by any of history's hitherto empires\nor feudalities, and the _sine qua non_ of carrying out the republican\nprinciple to develop itself in the New World through hundreds, thousands\nof years to come.\n\nIndeed, what most needs fostering through the hundred years to come, in\nall parts of the United States, north, south, Mississippi valley, and\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts, is this fused and fervent identity of the\nindividual, whoever he or she may be, and wherever the place, with the\nidea and fact of AMERICAN TOTALITY, and with what is meant by the Flag,\nthe stars and stripes. We need this conviction of nationality as a\nfaith, to be absorb'd in the blood and belief of the People everywhere,\nsouth, north, west, east, to emanate in their life, and in native\nliterature and art. We want the germinal idea that America, inheritor\nof the past, is the custodian of the future of humanity. Judging from\nhistory, it is some such moral and spiritual ideas appropriate to\nthem, (and such ideas only,) that have made the profoundest glory\nand endurance of nations in the past. The races of Judea, the classic\nclusters of Greece and Rome, and the feudal and ecclesiastical clusters\nof the Middle Ages, were each and all vitalized by their separate\ndistinctive ideas, ingrain'd in them, redeeming many sins, and indeed,\nin a sense, the principal reason-why for their whole career.\n\nThen, in the thought of nationality especially for the United States,\nand making them original, and different from all other countries,\nanother point ever remains to be considered. There are two distinct\nprinciples--aye, paradoxes--at the life-fountain and life-continuation\nof the States; one, the sacred principle of the Union, the right of\nensemble, at whatever sacrifice--and yet another, an equally sacred\nprinciple, the right of each State, consider'd as a separate sovereign\nindividual, in its own sphere. Some go zealously for one set of these\nrights, and some as zealously for the other set. We must have both; or\nrather, bred out of them, as out of mother and father, a third set, the\nperennial result and combination of both, and neither jeopardized. I\nsay the loss or abdication of one set, in the future, will be ruin to\ndemocracy just as much as the loss of the other set. The problem is,\nto harmoniously adjust the two, and the play of the two. [Observe the\nlesson of the divinity of Nature, ever checking the excess of one law,\nby an opposite, or seemingly opposite law--generally the other side of\nthe same law.] For the theory of this Republic is, not that the General\ngovernment is the fountain of all life and power, dispensing it forth,\naround, and to the remotest portions of our territory, but that THE\nPEOPLE are, represented in both, underlying both the General and State\ngovernments, and consider'd just as well in their individualities and\nin their separate aggregates, or States, as consider'd in one vast\naggregate, the Union. This was the original dual theory and\nfoundation of the United States, as distinguish'd from the feudal and\necclesiastical single idea of monarchies and papacies, and the divine\nright of kings. (Kings have been of use, hitherto, as representing the\nidea of the identity of nations. But, to American democracy, _both_\nideas must be fulfill'd, and in my opinion the loss of vitality of\neither one will indeed be the loss of vitality of the other.)\n\n\nEMERSON'S BOOKS, (THE SHADOWS OF THEM)\n\nIn the regions we call Nature, towering beyond all measurement, with\ninfinite spread, infinite depth and height--in those regions, including\nMan, socially and historically, with his moral-emotional influences--how\nsmall a part, (it came in my mind to-day,) has literature really\ndepicted--even summing up all of it, all ages. Seems at its best some\nlittle fleet of boats, hugging the shores of a boundless sea, and never\nventuring, exploring the unmapp'd--never, Columbus-like, sailing out for\nNew Worlds, and to complete the orb's rondure. Emerson writes frequently\nin the atmosphere of this thought, and his books report one or two\nthings from that very ocean and air, and more legibly address'd to\nour age and American polity than by any man yet. But I will begin by\nscarifying him--thus proving that I am not insensible to his deepest\nlessons. I will consider his books from a democratic and western point\nof view. I will specify the shadows on these sunny expanses. Somebody\nhas said of heroic character that \"wherever the tallest peaks are\npresent, must inevitably be deep chasms and valleys.\" Mine be the\nungracious task (for reasons) of leaving unmention'd both sunny expanses\nand sky-reaching heights, to dwell on the bare spots and darknesses. I\nhave a theory that no artist or work of the very first class may be or\ncan be without them.\n\nFirst, then, these pages are perhaps too perfect, too concentrated. (How\ngood, for instance, is good butter, good sugar. But to be eating nothing\nbut sugar and butter all the time! even if ever so good.) And though\nthe author has much to say of freedom and wildness and simplicity\nand spontaneity, no performance was ever more based on artificial\nscholarships and decorums at third or fourth removes, (he calls it\nculture,) and built up from them. It is always a _make_, never an\nunconscious _growth_. It is the porcelain figure or statuette of lion,\nor stag, or Indian hunter--and a very choice statuette too--appropriate\nfor the rosewood or marble bracket of parlor or library; never the\nanimal itself, or the hunter himself. Indeed, who wants the real animal\nor hunter? What would that do amid astral and bric-a-brac and tapestry,\nand ladies and gentlemen talking in subdued tones of Browning and\nLongfellow and art? The least suspicion of such actual bull, or Indian,\nor of Nature carrying out itself, would put all those good people to\ninstant terror and flight.\n\nEmerson, in my opinion, is not most eminent as poet or artist or\nteacher, though valuable in all those. He is best as critic, or\ndiagnoser. Not passion or imagination or warp or weakness, or any\npronounced cause or specialty, dominates him. Cold and bloodless\nintellectuality dominates him. (I know the fires, emotions, love,\negotisms, glow deep, perennial, as in all New Englanders--but the\nfacade, hides them well--they give no sign.) He does not see or take one\nside, one presentation only or mainly, (as all the poets, or most of the\nfine writers anyhow)--he sees all sides. His final influence is to\nmake his students cease to worship anything--almost cease to believe in\nanything, outside of themselves. These books will fill, and well fill,\ncertain stretches of life, certain stages of development--are, (like\nthe tenets or theology the author of them preach'd when a young man,)\nunspeakably serviceable and precious as a stage. But in old or nervous\nor solemnest or dying hours, when one needs the impalpably soothing and\nvitalizing influences of abysmic Nature, or its affinities in literature\nor human society, and the soul resents the keenest mere intellection,\nthey will not be sought for.\n\nFor a philosopher, Emerson possesses a singularly dandified theory of\nmanners. He seems to have no notion at all that manners are simply the\nsigns by which the chemist or metallurgist knows his metals. To the\nprofound scientist, all metals are profound, as they really are. The\nlittle one, like the conventional world, will make much of gold and\nsilver only. Then to the real artist in humanity, what are called bad\nmanners are often the most picturesque and significant of all. Suppose\nthese books becoming absorb'd, the permanent chyle of American general\nand particular character--what a well-wash'd and grammatical, but\nbloodless and helpless, race we should turn out! No, no, dear friend;\nthough the States want scholars, undoubtedly, and perhaps want ladies\nand gentlemen who use the bath frequently, and never laugh loud, or talk\nwrong, they don't want scholars, or ladies and gentlemen, at the expense\nof all the rest. They want good farmers, sailors, mechanics, clerks,\ncitizens--perfect business and social relations--perfect fathers and\nmothers. If we could only have these, or their approximations, plenty\nof them, fine and large and sane and generous and patriotic, they might\nmake their verbs disagree from their nominatives, and laugh like volleys\nof musketeers, if they should please. Of course these are not all\nAmerica wants, but they are first of all to be provided on a large\nscale. And, with tremendous errors and escapades, this, substantially,\nis what the States seem to have an intuition of, and to be mainly aiming\nat. The plan of a select class, superfined, (demarcated from the rest,)\nthe plan of Old World lands and literatures, is not so objectionable in\nitself, but because it chokes the true plan for us, and indeed is death\nto it. As to such special class, the United States can never produce any\nequal to the splendid show, (far, far beyond comparison or competition\nhere,) of the principal European nations, both in the past and at the\npresent day. But an immense and distinctive commonalty over our vast and\nvaried area, west and east, south and north--in fact, for the first time\nin history, a great, aggregated, real PEOPLE, worthy the name, and made\nof develop'd heroic individuals, both sexes--is America's principal,\nperhaps only, reason for being. If ever accomplish'd, it will be at\nleast as much, (I lately think, doubly as much,) the result of fitting\nand democratic sociologies, literatures and arts--if we ever get\nthem--as of our democratic politics.\n\nAt times it has been doubtful to me if Emerson really knows or feels\nwhat Poetry is at its highest, as in the Bible, for instance, or Homer\nor Shakspere. I see he covertly or plainly likes best superb verbal\npolish, or something old or odd--Waller's \"Go, lovely rose,\" or\nLovelace's lines \"to Lucusta\"--the quaint conceits of the old French\nbards, and the like. Of _power_ he seems to have a gentleman's\nadmiration--but in his inmost heart the grandest attribute of God and\nPoets is always subordinate to the octaves, conceits, polite kinks, and\nverbs.\n\nThe reminiscence that years ago I began like most youngsters to have\na touch (though it came late, and was only on the surface) of\nEmerson-on-the-brain--that I read his writings reverently, and address'd\nhim in print as \"Master,\" and for a month or so thought of him as\nsuch--I retain not only with composure, but positive satisfaction. I\nhave noticed that most young people of eager minds pass through this\nstage of exercise.\n\nThe best part of Emersonianism is, it breeds the giant that destroys\nitself. Who wants to be any man's mere follower? lurks behind every\npage. No teacher ever taught, that has so provided for his pupil's\nsetting up independently--no truer evolutionist.\n\n\nVENTURES, ON AN OLD THEME\n\nA DIALOGUE--\n\n_One party says_--We arrange our lives--even the best and boldest men\nand women that exist, just as much as the most limited--with reference\nto what society conventionally rules and makes right. We retire to our\nrooms for freedom; to undress, bathe, unloose everything in freedom.\nThese, and much else, would not be proper in society.\n\n_Other party answers_--Such is the rule of society. Not always so, and\nconsiderable exceptions still exist. However, it must be called the\ngeneral rule, sanction'd by immemorial usage, and will probably always\nremain so.\n\n_First party_--Why not, then, respect it in your poems?\n\n_Answer_--One reason, and to me a profound one, is that the soul of a\nman or woman demands, enjoys compensation in the highest directions for\nthis very restraint of himself or herself, level'd to the average, or\nrather mean, low, however eternally practical, requirements of society's\nintercourse. To balance this indispensable abnegation, the free minds\nof poets relieve themselves, and strengthen and enrich mankind with free\nflights in all the directions not tolerated by ordinary society.\n\n_First party_--But must not outrage or give offence to it.\n\n_Answer_--No, not in the deepest sense--and do not, and cannot. The\nvast averages of time and the race _en masse_ settle these things. Only\nunderstand that the conventional standards and laws proper enough for\nordinary society apply neither to the action of the soul, nor its poets.\nIn fact the latter know no laws but the laws of themselves, planted in\nthem by God, and are themselves the last standards of the law, and its\nfinal exponents--responsible to Him directly, and not at all to mere\netiquette. Often the best service that can be done to the race, is\nto lift the veil, at least for a time, from these rules and\nfossil-etiquettes.\n\n\nNEW POETRY--_California, Canada, Texas_.--In my opinion the time has\narrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and\npoetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character\nregardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee,\ndactyl, &c., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue\nto furnish the medium for inferior writers and themes, (especially for\npersiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect\ntaste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself, and\nanyhow,) the truest and greatest _Poetry_, (while subtly and necessarily\nalways rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in\nthe English language, be express'd in arbitrary and rhyming metre, any\nmore than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. While\nadmitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification\nhave in their time play'd great and fitting parts--that the pensive\ncomplaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many\nof them, been inimitably render'd in rhyming verse--that there have\nbeen very illustrious poets whose shapes the mantle of such verse\nhas beautifully and appropriately envelopt--and though the mantle\nhas fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age--it is,\nnot-withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme\nis ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic\npractical or spiritual expression, present or future, it palpably\nfails, and must fail, to serve. The Muse of the Prairies, of California,\nCanada, Texas, and of the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary,\nas well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully\nenlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people,\nwith the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong\nto them, body and soul--to the general globe, and all its relations in\nastronomy, as the savans portray them to us--to the modern, the busy\nNineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different,)\nwith steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder\npresses--to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood\nand sisterhood of the entire earth--to the dignity and heroism of the\npractical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or\non shipboard, or on lakes and rivers--resumes that other medium of\nexpression, more flexible, more eligible--soars to the freer, vast,\ndiviner heaven of prose.\n\nOf poems of the third or fourth class, (perhaps even some of the\nsecond,) it makes little or no difference who writes them--they are good\nenough for what they are; nor is it necessary that they should be\nactual emanations from the personality and life of the writers. The very\nreverse sometimes gives piquancy. But poems of the first class, (poems\nof the depth, as distinguished from those of the surface,) are to be\nsternly tallied with the poets themselves, and tried by them and their\nlives. Who wants a glorification of courage and manly defiance from\na coward or a sneak?--a ballad of benevolence or chastity from some\nrhyming hunks, or lascivious, glib _roue_?\n\nIn these States, beyond all precedent, poetry will have to do with\nactual facts, with the concrete States, and--for we have not much more\nthan begun--with the definitive getting into shape of the Union. Indeed\nI sometimes think _it_ alone is to define the Union, (namely, to give\nit artistic character, spirituality, dignity.) What American humanity is\nmost in danger of is an overwhelming prosperity, \"business\" worldliness,\nmaterialism: what is most lacking, east, west, north, south, is a fervid\nand glowing Nationality and patriotism, cohering all the parts into one.\nWho may fend that danger, and fill that lack in the future, but a class\nof loftiest poets?\n\nIf the United States haven't grown poets, on any scale of grandeur,\nit is certain they import, print, and read more poetry than any equal\nnumber of people elsewhere--probably more than all the rest of the world\ncombined.\n\nPoetry (like a grand personality) is a growth of many generations--many\nrare combinations.\n\nTo have great poets, there must be great audiences, too.\n\n\nBRITISH LITERATURE\n\nTo avoid mistake, I would say that I not only commend the study of\nthis literature, but wish our sources of supply and comparison vastly\nenlarged. American students may well derive from all former lands--from\nforenoon Greece and Rome, down to the perturb'd mediaeval times,\nthe Crusades, and so to Italy, the German intellect--all the older\nliteratures, and all the newer ones--from witty and warlike France,\nand markedly, and in many ways, and at many different periods, from the\nenterprise and soul of the great Spanish race--bearing ourselves\nalways courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the\nmother-world, to all its nations dead, as all its nations living--the\noffspring, this America of ours, the daughter, not by any means of the\nBritish isles exclusively, but of the continent, and all continents.\nIndeed, it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we\nalso hold from Italy, France, Spain, especially in the best imaginative\nproductions of those lands, which are, in many ways, loftier and subtler\nthan the English, or British, and indispensable to complete our service,\nproportions, education, reminiscences, &c.... The British element\nthese States hold, and have always held, enormously beyond its fit\nproportions. I have already spoken of Shakspere. He seems to me\nof astral genius, first class, entirely fit for feudalism. His\ncontributions, especially to the literature of the passions, are\nimmense, forever dear to humanity--and his name is always to be\nreverenced in America. But there is much in him ever offensive to\ndemocracy. He is not only the tally of feudalism, but I should say\nShakspere is incarnated, uncompromising feudalism, in literature. Then\none seems to detect something in him--I hardly know how to describe\nit--even amid the dazzle of his genius; and, in inferior manifestations,\nit is found in nearly all leading British authors. (Perhaps we will have\nto import the words Snob, Snobbish, &c., after all.) While of the great\npoems of Asian antiquity, the Indian epics, the book of Job, the Ionian\nIliad, the unsurpassedly simple, loving, perfect idyls of the life and\ndeath of Christ, in the New Testament, (indeed Homer and the Biblical\nutterances intertwine familiarly with us, in the main,) and along down,\nof most of the characteristic, imaginative or romantic relics of the\ncontinent, as the Cid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, &c., I should say they\nsubstantially adjust themselves to us, and, far off as they are, accord\ncuriously with our bed and board to-day, in New York, Washington,\nCanada, Ohio, Texas, California--and with our notions, both of\nseriousness and of fun, and our standards of heroism, manliness, and\neven the democratic requirements--those requirements are not only not\nfulfill'd in the Shaksperean productions, but are insulted on every\npage.\n\nI add that--while England is among the greatest of lands in political\nfreedom, or the idea of it, and in stalwart personal character, &c.--the\nspirit of English literature is not great, at least is not greatest--and\nits products are no models for us. With the exception of Shakspere,\nthere is no first-class genius in that literature--which, with a truly\nvast amount of value, and of artificial beauty, (largely from the\nclassics,) is almost always material, sensual, not spiritual--almost\nalways congests, makes plethoric, not frees, expands, dilates--is cold,\nanti-democratic, loves to be sluggish and stately, and shows much of\nthat characteristic of vulgar persons, the dread of saying or doing\nsomething not at all improper in itself, but unconventional, and that\nmay be laugh'd at. In its best, the sombre pervades it; it is moody,\nmelancholy, and, to give it its due, expresses, in characters and\nplots, those qualities, in an unrival'd manner. Yet not as the black\nthunder-storms, and in great normal, crashing passions, of the Greek\ndramatists--clearing the air, refreshing afterward, bracing with power;\nbut as in Hamlet, moping, sick, uncertain, and leaving ever after a\nsecret taste for the blues, the morbid fascination, the luxury of wo....\n\nI strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the United\nStates to whom it may be eligible, to overhaul the well-freighted\nfleets, the literatures of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, so full of\nthose elements of freedom, self-possession, gay-heartedness, subtlety,\ndilation, needed in preparations for the future of the States. I only\nwish we could have really good translations. I rejoice at the feeling\nfor Oriental researches and poetry, and hope it will go on.\n\n\nDARWINISM--(THEN FURTHERMORE)\n\nRunning through prehistoric ages--coming down from them into the\ndaybreak of our records, founding theology, suffusing literature, and so\nbrought onward--(a sort of verteber and marrow to all the antique races\nand lands, Egypt, India, Greece, Rome, the Chinese, the Jews, &c., and\ngiving cast and complexion to their art, poems, and their politics as\nwell as ecclesiasticism, all of which we more or less inherit,) appear\nthose venerable claims to origin from God himself, or from gods and\ngoddesses--ancestry from divine beings of vaster beauty, size, and power\nthan ours. But in current and latest times, the theory of human\norigin that seems to have most made its mark, (curiously reversing the\nantique,) is that we have come on, originated, developt, from monkeys,\nbaboons--a theory more significant perhaps in its indirections, or what\nit necessitates, than it is even in itself. (Of the twain, far apart as\nthey seem, and angrily as their conflicting advocates to-day oppose\neach other, are not both theories to be possibly reconcil'd, and even\nblended? Can we, indeed, spare either of them? Better still, out of\nthem is not a third theory, the real one, or suggesting the real one, to\narise?)\n\nOf this old theory, evolution, as broach'd anew, trebled, with indeed\nall-devouring claims, by Darwin, it has so much in it, and is so needed\nas a counterpoise to yet widely prevailing and unspeakably tenacious,\nenfeebling superstitions--is fused, by the new man, into such grand,\nmodest, truly scientific accompaniments--that the world of erudition,\nboth moral and physical, cannot but be eventually better'd and broaden'd\nin its speculations, from the advent of Darwinism. Nevertheless, the\nproblem of origins, human and other, is not the least whit nearer\nits solution. In due time the Evolution theory will have to abate its\nvehemence, cannot be allow'd to dominate every thing else, and will have\nto take its place as a segment of the circle, the cluster--as but one of\nmany theories, many thoughts, of profoundest value--and re-adjusting\nand differentiating much, yet leaving the divine secrets just as\ninexplicable and unreachable as before--maybe more so.\n\n_Then furthermore_--What is finally to be done by priest or poet--and by\npriest or poet only--amid all the stupendous and dazzling novelties\nof our century, with the advent of America, and of science and\ndemocracy--remains just as indispensable, after all the work of the\ngrand astronomers, chemists, linguists, historians, and explorers of the\nlast hundred years--and the wondrous German and other metaphysicians of\nthat time--and will continue to remain, needed, America and here,\njust the same as in the world of Europe, or Asia, of a hundred, or a\nthousand, or several thousand years ago. I think indeed _more_ needed,\nto furnish statements from the present points, the added arriere, and\nthe unspeakably immenser vistas of to-day. Only, the priests and poets\nof the modern, at least as exalted as any in the past, fully absorbing\nand appreciating the results of the past, in the commonalty of all\nhumanity, all time, (the main results already, for there is perhaps\nnothing more, or at any rate not much, strictly new, only more important\nmodern combinations, and new relative adjustments,) must indeed recast\nthe old metal, the already achiev'd material, into and through new\nmoulds, current forms.\n\nMeantime, the highest and subtlest and broadest truths of modern science\nwait for their true assignment and last vivid flashes of light--as\nDemocracy waits for it's--through first-class metaphysicians and\nspeculative philosophs--laying the basements and foundations for those\nnew, more expanded, more harmonious, more melodious, freer American\npoems.\n\n\n\"SOCIETY\"\n\nI have myself little or no hope from what is technically called\n\"Society\" in our American cities. New York, of which place I have spoken\nso sharply, still promises something, in time, out of its tremendous\nand varied materials, with a certain superiority of intuitions, and the\nadvantage of constant agitation, and ever new and rapid dealings of\nthe cards. Of Boston, with its circles of social mummies, swathed in\ncerements harder than brass--its bloodless religion, (Unitarianism,)\nits complacent vanity of scientism and literature, lots of grammatical\ncorrectness, mere knowledge, (always wearisome, in itself)--its zealous\nabstractions, ghosts of reforms--I should say, (ever admitting its\nbusiness powers, its sharp, almost demoniac, intellect, and no lack, in\nits own way, of courage and generosity)--there is, at present, little\nof cheering, satisfying sign. In the West, California, &c., \"society\" is\nyet unform'd, puerile, seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving\nbusiness, or to liberally spend the money made by it, in the usual\nrounds and shows.\n\nThen there is, to the humorous observer of American attempts at fashion,\naccording to the models of foreign courts and saloons, quite a\ncomic side--particularly visible at Washington city--a sort of\nhigh-life-below-stairs business. As if any farce could be funnier,\nfor instance, than the scenes of the crowds, winter nights, meandering\naround our Presidents and their wives, cabinet officers, western or\nother Senators, Representatives, &c.; born of good laboring mechanic or\nfarmer stock and antecedents, attempting those full-dress receptions,\nfinesse of parlors, foreign ceremonies, etiquettes, &c.\n\nIndeed, consider'd with any sense of propriety, or any sense at all,\nthe whole of this illy-play'd fashionable play and display, with their\nabsorption of the best part of our wealthier citizens' time, money,\nenergies, &c., is ridiculously out of place in the United States. As if\nour proper man and woman, (far, far greater words than \"gentleman\"\nand \"lady,\") could still fail to see, and presently achieve, not this\nspectral business, but something truly noble, active, sane, American--by\nmodes, perfections of character, manners, costumes, social relations,\n&c., adjusted to standards, far, far different from those.\n\nEminent and liberal foreigners, British or continental, must at times\nhave their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our New World\npersonalities. The shallowest and least American persons seem surest\nto push abroad, and call without fail on well-known foreigners, who are\ndoubtless affected with indescribable qualms by these queer ones. Then,\nmore than half of our authors and writers evidently think it a\ngreat thing to be \"aristocratic,\" and sneer at progress, democracy,\nrevolution, etc. If some international literary snobs' gallery were\nestablish'd, it is certain that America could contribute at least her\nfull share of the portraits, and some very distinguish'd ones. Observe\nthat the most impudent slanders, low insults, &c., on the great\nrevolutionary authors, leaders, poets, &c., of Europe, have their origin\nand main circulation in certain circles here. The treatment of Victor\nHugo living, and Byron dead, are samples. Both deserving so well of\nAmerica, and both persistently attempted to be soil'd here by unclean\nbirds, male and female.\n\nMeanwhile I must still offset the like of the foregoing, and all it\ninfers, by the recognition of the fact, that while the surfaces of\ncurrent society here show so much that is dismal, noisome, and vapory,\nthere are, beyond question, inexhaustible supplies, as of true gold ore,\nin the mines of America's general humanity. Let us, not ignoring the\ndross, give fit stress to these precious immortal values also. Let it\nbe distinctly admitted, that--whatever may be said of our fashionable\nsociety, and of any foul fractions and episodes--only here in America,\nout of the long history and manifold presentations of the ages, has at\nlast arisen, and now stands, what never before took positive form\nand sway, _the People_--and that view'd en masse, and while fully\nacknowledging deficiencies, dangers, faults, this people, inchoate,\nlatent, not yet come to majority, nor to its own religious, literary, or\nesthetic expression, yet affords, to-day, an exultant justification\nof all the faith, all the hopes and prayers and prophecies of good\nmen through the past--the stablest, solidest-based government of\nthe world--the most assured in a future--the beaming Pharos to whose\nperennial light all earnest eyes, the world over, are tending--and that\nalready, in and from it, the democratic principle, having been mortally\ntried by severest tests, fatalities of war and peace, now issues from\nthe trial, unharm'd, trebly-invigorated, perhaps to commence forthwith\nits finally triumphant march around the globe.\n\n\nTHE TRAMP AND STRIKE QUESTIONS: _Part of a Lecture proposed, (never\ndeliver'd)_\n\nTwo grim and spectral dangers--dangerous to peace, to health, to social\nsecurity, to progress--long known in concrete to the governments of the\nOld World, and there eventuating, more than once or twice, in dynastic\noverturns, bloodshed, days, months, of terror--seem of late years to\nbe nearing the New World, nay, to be gradually establishing themselves\namong us. What mean these phantoms here? (I personify them in fictitious\nshapes, but they are very real.) Is the fresh and broad demesne of\nAmerica destined also to give them foothold and lodgment, permanent\ndomicile?\n\nBeneath the whole political world, what most presses and perplexes\nto-day, sending vastest results affecting the future, is not the\nabstract question of democracy, but of social and economic organization,\nthe treatment of working-people by employers, and all that goes along\nwith it--not only the wages-payment part, but a certain spirit and\nprinciple, to vivify anew these relations; all the questions of\nprogress, strength, tariffs, finance, &c., really evolving themselves\nmore or less directly out of the Poverty Question, (\"the Science of\nWealth,\" and a dozen other names are given it, but I prefer the severe\none just used.) I will begin by calling the reader's attention to a\nthought upon the matter which may not have struck you before--the wealth\nof the civilized world, as contrasted with its poverty--what does it\nderivatively stand for, and represent? A rich person ought to have a\nstrong stomach. As in Europe the wealth of to-day mainly results from,\nand represents, the rapine, murder, outrages, treachery, hoggishness, of\nhundreds of years ago, and onward, later, so in America, after the same\ntoken--(not yet so bad, perhaps, or at any rate not so palpable--we have\nnot existed long enough--but we seem to be doing our best to make it\nup.)\n\nCurious as it may seem, it is in what are call'd the poorest, lowest\ncharacters you will sometimes, nay generally, find glints of the most\nsublime virtues, eligibilities, heroisms. Then it is doubtful whether\nthe State is to be saved, either in the monotonous long run, or in\ntremendous special crises, by its good people only. When the storm is\ndeadliest, and the disease most imminent, help often comes from strange\nquarters--(the homoeopathic motto, you remember, _cure the bite with a\nhair of the same dog.)_\n\nThe American Revolution of 1776 was simply a great strike, successful\nfor its immediate object--but whether a real success judged by the scale\nof the centuries, and the long-striking balance of Time, yet remains to\nbe settled. The French Revolution was absolutely a strike, and a very\nterrible and relentless one, against ages of bad pay, unjust division\nof wealth-products, and the hoggish monopoly of a few, rolling in\nsuperfluity, against the vast bulk of the work-people, living in\nsqualor.\n\nIf the United States, like the countries of the Old World, are also\nto grow vast crops of poor, desperate, dissatisfied, nomadic,\nmiserably-waged populations, such as we see looming upon us of late\nyears--steadily, even if slowly, eating into them like a cancer of lungs\nor stomach--then our republican experiment, notwithstanding all its\nsurface-successes, is at heart an unhealthy failure.\n\n_Feb. '79._--I saw to-day a sight I had never seen before--and it\namazed, and made me serious; three quite good-looking American men,\nof respectable personal presence, two of them young, carrying\nchiffonier-bags on their shoulders, and the usual long iron hooks in\ntheir hands, plodding along, their eyes cast down, spying for scraps,\nrags, bones, &c.\n\n\nDEMOCRACY IN THE NEW WORLD\n\nEstimated and summ'd-up to-day, having thoroughly justified itself\nthe past hundred years, (as far as growth, vitality and power are\nconcern'd,) by severest and most varied trials of peace and war,\nand having establish'd itself for good, with all its necessities and\nbenefits, for time to come, is now to be seriously consider'd also\nin its pronounc'd and already developt dangers. While the battle was\nraging, and the result suspended, all defections and criticisms were\nto be hush'd, and everything bent with vehemence unmitigated toward the\nurge of victory. But that victory settled, new responsibilities advance.\nI can conceive of no better service in the United States, henceforth,\nby democrats of thorough and heart-felt faith, than boldly exposing\nthe weakness, liabilities and infinite corruptions of democracy. By the\nunprecedented opening-up of humanity en-masse in the United States, the\nlast hundred years, under our institutions, not only the good qualities\nof the race, but just as much the bad ones, are prominently brought\nforward. Man is about the same, in the main, whether with despotism, or\nwhether with freedom.\n\n\"The ideal form of human society,\" Canon Kingsley declares, \"is\ndemocracy. A nation--and were it even possible, a whole world--of free\nmen, lifting free foreheads to God and Nature; calling no man master,\nfor One is their master, even God; knowing and doing their duties toward\nthe Maker of the universe, and therefore to each other; not from fear,\nnor calculation of profit or loss, but because they have seen the beauty\nof righteousness, and trust, and peace; because the law of God is in\ntheir hearts. Such a nation--such a society--what nobler conception of\nmoral existence can we form? Would not that, indeed, be the kingdom of\nGod come on earth?\"\n\nTo this faith, founded in the ideal, let us hold--and never abandon\nor lose it. Then what a spectacle is _practically_ exhibited by our\nAmerican democracy to-day!\n\n\nFOUNDATION STAGES--THEN OTHERS\n\nThough I think I fully comprehend the absence of moral tone in our\ncurrent politics and business, and the almost entire futility of\nabsolute and simple honor as a counterpoise against the enormous greed\nfor worldly wealth, with the trickeries of gaining it, all through\nsociety our day, I still do not share the depression and despair on the\nsubject which I find possessing many good people. The advent of America,\nthe history of the past century, has been the first general aperture and\nopening-up to the average human commonalty, on the broadest scale, of\nthe eligibilities to wealth and worldly success and eminence, and has\nbeen fully taken advantage of; and the example has spread hence, in\nripples, to all nations. To these eligibilities--to this limitless\naperture, the race has tended, en-masse, roaring and rushing and crude,\nand fiercely, turbidly hastening--and we have seen the first stages,\nand are now in the midst of the result of it all, so far. But there will\ncertainly ensue other stages, and entirely different ones. In nothing\nis there more evolution than the American mind. Soon, it will be fully\nrealized that ostensible wealth and money-making, show, luxury, &c.,\nimperatively necessitate something beyond--namely, the sane, eternal\nmoral and spiritual-esthetic attributes, elements. (We cannot have even\nthat realization on any less terms than the price we are now paying\nfor it.) Soon, it will be understood clearly, that the State cannot\nflourish, (nay, cannot exist,) without those elements. They will\ngradually enter into the chyle of sociology and literature. They will\nfinally make the blood and brawn of the best American individualities\nof both sexes--and thus, with them, to a certainty, (through these very\nprocesses of to-day,) dominate the New World.\n\n\nGENERAL SUFFRAGE, ELECTIONS, ETC.\n\nIt still remains doubtful to me whether these will ever secure,\nofficially, the best wit and capacity--whether, through them, the\nfirst-class genius of America will ever personally appear in the high\npolitical stations, the Presidency, Congress, the leading State\noffices, &c. Those offices, or the candidacy for them, arranged, won,\nby caucusing, money, the favoritism or pecuniary interest of rings, the\nsuperior manipulation of the ins over the outs, or the outs over the\nins, are, indeed, at best, the mere business agencies of the people, are\nuseful as formulating, neither the best and highest, but the average\nof the public judgment, sense, justice, (or sometimes want of judgment,\nsense, justice.) We elect Presidents, Congressmen, &c., not so much to\nhave them consider and decide for us, but as surest practical means of\nexpressing the will of majorities on mooted questions, measures, &c.\n\nAs to general suffrage, after all, since we have gone so far, the more\ngeneral it is, the better. I favor the widest opening of the doors. Let\nthe ventilation and area be wide enough, and all is safe. We can never\nhave a born penitentiary-bird, or panel-thief, or lowest gambling-hell\nor groggery keeper, for President--though such may not only emulate, but\nget, high offices from localities--even from the proud and wealthy city\nof New York.\n\n\nWHO GETS THE PLUNDER?\n\nThe protectionists are fond of flashing to the public eye the glittering\ndelusion of great money-results from manufactures, mines, artificial\nexports--so many millions from this source, and so many from that--such\na seductive, unanswerable show--an immense revenue of annual cash from\niron, cotton, woollen, leather goods, and a hundred other things, all\nbolstered up by \"protection.\" But the really important point of all\nis, _into whose pockets does this plunder really go?_ It would be some\nexcuse and satisfaction if even a fair proportion of it went to the\nmasses of laboring-men--resulting in homesteads to such, men, women,\nchildren--myriads of actual homes in fee simple, in every State, (not\nthe false glamour of the stunning wealth reported in the census, in\nthe statistics, or tables in the newspapers,) but a fair division\nand generous average to those workmen and workwomen--_that_ would be\nsomething. But the fact itself is nothing of the kind. The profits of\n\"protection\" go altogether to a few score select persons--who, by\nfavors of Congress, State legislatures, the banks, and other special\nadvantages, are forming a vulgar aristocracy, full as bad as anything in\nthe British or European castes, of blood, or the dynasties there of the\npast. As Sismondi pointed out, the true prosperity of a nation is not in\nthe great wealth of a special class, but is only to be really attain'd\nin having the bulk of the people provided with homes or land in fee\nsimple. This may not be the best show, but it is the best reality.\n\n\nFRIENDSHIP, (THE REAL ARTICLE)\n\nThough Nature maintains, and must prevail, there will always be plenty\nof people, and good people, who cannot, or think they cannot, see\nanything in that last, wisest, most envelop'd of proverbs, \"Friendship\nrules the World.\" Modern society, in its largest vein, is essentially\nintellectual, infidelistic--secretly admires, and depends most on,\npure compulsion or science, its rule and sovereignty--is, in short, in\n\"cultivated\" quarters, deeply Napoleonic.\n\n\"Friendship,\" said Bonaparte, in one of his lightning-flashes of\ncandid garrulity, \"Friendship is but a name. I love no one--not even my\nbrothers; Joseph perhaps a little. Still, if I do love him, it is from\nhabit, because he is the eldest of us. Duroc? Ay, him, if any one,\nI love in a sort--but why? He suits me; he is cool, undemonstrative,\nunfeeling--has no weak affections--never embraces any one--never weeps.\"\n\nI am not sure but the same analogy is to be applied, in cases, often\nseen, where, with an extra development and acuteness of the intellectual\nfaculties, there is a mark'd absence of the spiritual, affectional, and\nsometimes, though more rarely, the highest esthetic and moral elements\nof cognition.\n\n\nLACKS AND WANTS YET\n\nOf most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times\nknown, down to our own, each has contributed after its kind, directly\nor indirectly, at least one great undying song, to help vitalize and\nincrease the valor, wisdom, and elegance of humanity, from the points of\nview attain'd by it up to date. The stupendous epics of India, the holy\nBible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador,\nthe Inferno, Shakspere's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords,\nBurns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor\nHugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various yet integral\nsigns or land-marks, (in certain respects the highest set up by the\nhuman mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration,\n&c.,) narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of\nhistory, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate\nhumanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied\ncivilizations.... Where is America's art-rendering, in any thing like\nthe spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic\nimmortal monuments? So far, our Democratic society, (estimating its\nvarious strata, in the mass, as one,) possesses nothing--nor have we\ncontributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality--to\nmake up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional,\nartistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which\nfused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together, in their\nwonderful interpenetration, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief,\nand loyalty, running one way like a living weft--and picturesque\nresponsibility, duty, and blessedness, running like a warp the other\nway. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.)...\nIn coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more\nterrible, more alarming, than the total want of any such fusion\nand mutuality of love, belief, and rapport of interest, between\nthe comparatively few successful rich, and the great masses of the\nunsuccessful, the poor? As a mixed political and social question, is not\nthis full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem\nand puzzle in our democracy--an indispensable want to be supplied?\n\n\nRULERS STRICTLY OUT OF THE MASSES\n\nIn the talk (which I welcome) about the need of men of training,\nthoroughly school'd and experienced men, for statesmen, I would present\nthe following as an offset. It was written by me twenty years ago--and\nhas been curiously verified since:\n\nI say no body of men are fit to make Presidents, Judges, and Generals,\nunless they themselves supply the best specimens of the same; and that\nsupplying one or two such specimens illuminates the whole body for a\nthousand years. I expect to see the day when the like of the present\npersonnel of the governments, Federal, State, municipal, military, and\nnaval, will be look'd upon with derision, and when qualified mechanics\nand young men will reach Congress and other official stations, sent\nin their working costumes, fresh from their benches and tools, and\nreturning to them again with dignity. The young fellows must prepare\nto do credit to this destiny, for the stuff is in them. Nothing gives\nplace, recollect, and never ought to give place, except to its clean\nsuperiors. There is more rude and undevelopt bravery, friendship,\nconscientiousness, clear-sightedness, and practical genius for any\nscope of action, even the broadest and highest, now among the American\nmechanics and young men, than in all the official persons in these\nStates, legislative, executive, judicial, military, and naval, and more\nthan among all the literary persons. I would be much pleas'd to see some\nheroic, shrewd, fully-inform'd, healthy-bodied, middle-aged, beard-faced\nAmerican blacksmith or boatman come down from the West across the\nAlleghanies, and walk into the Presidency, dress'd in a clean suit of\nworking attire, and with the tan all over his face, breast, and arms;\nI would certainly vote for that sort of man, possessing the due\nrequirements, before any other candidate.\n\n(The facts of rank-and-file workingmen, mechanics, Lincoln, Johnson,\nGrant, Garfield, brought forward from the masses and placed in the\nPresidency, and swaying its mighty powers with firm hand--really with\nmore sway than any king in history, and with better capacity in using\nthat sway--can we not see that these facts have bearings far, far beyond\ntheir political or party ones?)\n\n\nMONUMENTS--THE PAST AND PRESENT\n\nIf you go to Europe, (to say nothing of Asia, more ancient and massive\nstill,) you cannot stir without meeting venerable mementos--cathedrals,\nruins of temples, castles, monuments of the great, statues and\npaintings, (far, far beyond anything America can ever expect to\nproduce,) haunts of heroes long dead, saints, poets, divinities, with\ndeepest associations of ages. But here in the New World, while _those_\nwe can never emulate, we have _more_ than those to build, and far more\ngreatly to build. (I am not sure but the day for conventional monuments,\nstatues, memorials, &c., has pass'd away--and that they are henceforth\nsuperfluous and vulgar.) An enlarg'd general superior humanity, (partly\nindeed resulting from those,) we are to build. European, Asiatic\ngreatness are in the past. Vaster and subtler, America, combining,\njustifying the past, yet works for a grander future, in living\ndemocratic forms. (Here too are indicated the paths for our national\nbards.) Other times, other lands, have had their missions--Art, War,\nEcclesiasticism, Literature, Discovery, Trade, Architecture, &c.,\n&c.--but that grand future is the enclosing purport of the United\nStates.\n\n\nLITTLE OR NOTHING NEW, AFTER ALL\n\nHow small were the best thoughts, poems, conclusions, except for\na certain invariable resemblance and uniform standard in the final\nthoughts, theology, poems, &c., of all nations, all civilizations, all\ncenturies and times. Those precious legacies--accumulations! They come\nto us from the far-off--from all eras, and all lands--from Egypt, and\nIndia, and Greece, and Rome--and along through the middle and later\nages, in the grand monarchies of Europe--born under far different\ninstitutes and conditions from ours--but out of the insight and\ninspiration of the same old humanity--the same old heart and brain--the\nsame old countenance yearningly, pensively, looking forth. What we have\nto do to-day is to receive them cheerfully, and to give them ensemble,\nand a modern American and democratic physiognomy.\n\n\nA LINCOLN REMINISCENCE\n\nAs is well known, story-telling was often with President Lincoln a\nweapon which he employ'd with great skill. Very often he could not\ngive a point-blank reply or comment--and these indirections, (sometimes\nfunny, but not always so,) were probably the best responses possible. In\nthe gloomiest period of the war, he had a call from a large delegation\nof bank presidents. In the talk after business was settled, one of the\nbig Dons asked Mr. Lincoln if his confidence in the permanency of the\nUnion was not beginning to be shaken--whereupon the homely President\ntold a little story: \"When I was a young man in Illinois,\" said he, \"I\nboarded for a time with a deacon of the Presbyterian church. One night I\nwas roused from my sleep by a rap at the door, and I heard the deacon's\nvoice exclaiming, 'Arise, Abraham! the day of judgment has come!' I\nsprang from my bed and rushed to the window, and saw the stars falling\nin great showers; but looking back of them in the heavens I saw the\ngrand old constellations, with which I was so well acquainted, fixed and\ntrue in their places. Gentlemen, the world did not come to an end then,\nnor will the Union now.\"\n\n\nFREEDOM\n\nIt is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand Freedom, but\nI sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands\nit. The whole Universe is absolute Law. Freedom only opens entire\nactivity and license _under the law_. To the degraded or undevelopt--and\neven to too many others--the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping\nfrom law--which, of course, is impossible. More precious than all\nworldly riches is Freedom--freedom from the painful constipation and\npoor narrowness of ecclesiasticism--freedom in manners, habiliments,\nfurniture, from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions--entire\nfreedom from party rings and mere conventions in Politics--and better\nthan all, a general freedom of One's-Self from the tyrannic domination\nof vices, habits, appetites, under which nearly every man of us, (often\nthe greatest brawler for freedom,) is enslav'd. Can we attain such\nenfranchisement--the true Democracy, and the height of it? While we are\nfrom birth to death the subjects of irresistible law, enclosing every\nmovement and minute, we yet escape, by a paradox, into true free will.\nStrange as it may seem, we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of, and\nimplicit obedience to, Law. Great--unspeakably great--is the Will! the\nfree Soul of man! At its greatest, understanding and obeying the laws,\nit can then, and then only, maintain true liberty. For there is to the\nhighest, that law as absolute as any--more absolute than any--the Law of\nLiberty. The shallow, as intimated, consider liberty a release from all\nlaw, from every constraint. The wise see in it, on the contrary, the\npotent Law of Laws, namely, the fusion and combination of the conscious\nwill, or partial individual law, with those universal, eternal,\nunconscious ones, which run through all Time, pervade history, prove\nimmortality, give moral purpose to the entire objective world, and the\nlast dignity to human life.\n\n\nBOOK-CLASSES--AMERICA'S LITERATURE\n\nFor certain purposes, literary productions through all the recorded ages\nmay be roughly divided into two classes. The first consisting of only\na score or two, perhaps less, of typical, primal, representative works,\ndifferent from any before, and embodying in themselves their own main\nlaws and reasons for being. Then the second class, books and writings\ninnumerable, incessant--to be briefly described as radiations or\noffshoots, or more or less imitations of the first. The works of the\nfirst class, as said, have their own laws, and may indeed be described\nas making those laws, and amenable only to them. The sharp warning of\nMargaret Fuller, unquell'd for thirty years, yet sounds in the air:\n\"It does not follow that because the United States print and read more\nbooks, magazines, and newspapers than all the rest of the world, that\nthey really have, therefore, a literature.\"\n\n\nOUR REAL CULMINATION\n\nThe final culmination of this vast and varied Republic will be the\nproduction and perennial establishment of millions of comfortable city\nhomesteads and moderate-sized farms, healthy and independent, single\nseparate ownership, fee simple, life in them complete but cheap, within\nreach of all. Exceptional wealth, splendor, countless manufactures,\nexcess of exports, immense capital and capitalists, the\nfive-dollar-a-day hotels well fill'd, artificial improvements, even\nbooks, colleges, and the suffrage--all, in many respects, in themselves,\n(hard as it is to say so, and sharp as a surgeon's lance,) form, more or\nless, a sort of anti-democratic disease and monstrosity, except as\nthey contribute by curious indirections to that culmination--seem to me\nmainly of value, or worth consideration, only with reference to it.\n\nThere is a subtle something in the common earth, crops, cattle, air,\ntrees, &c., and in having to do at first hand with them, that forms the\nonly purifying and perennial element for individuals and for society.\nI must confess I want to see the agricultural occupation of America at\nfirst hand permanently broaden'd. Its gains are the only ones on which\nGod seems to smile. What others--what business, profit, wealth, without\na taint? What fortune else--what dollar--does not stand for, and come\nfrom, more or less imposition, lying, unnaturalness?\n\n\nAN AMERICAN PROBLEM\n\nOne of the problems presented in America these times is, how to\ncombine one's duty and policy as a member of associations, societies,\nbrotherhoods or what not, and one's obligations to the State and Nation,\nwith essential freedom as an individual personality, without which\nfreedom a man cannot grow or expand, or be full, modern, heroic,\ndemocratic, American. With all the necessities and benefits of\nassociation, (and the world cannot get along without it,) the true\nnobility and satisfaction of a man consist in his thinking and acting\nfor himself. The problem, I say, is to combine the two, so as not to\nignore either.\n\n\nTHE LAST COLLECTIVE COMPACTION\n\nI like well our polyglot construction-stamp, and the retention thereof,\nin the broad, the tolerating, the many-sided, the collective. All\nnations here--a home for every race on earth. British, German,\nScandinavian, Spanish, French, Italian--papers published, plays acted,\nspeeches made, in all languages--on our shores the crowning resultant\nof those distillations, decantations, compactions of humanity, that have\nbeen going on, on trial, over the earth so long.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\n\n\nPIECES IN EARLY YOUTH\n\n1834-'42\n\n\nDOUGH-FACE SONG --Like dough; soft; yielding to pressure;\npale----_Webster's Dictionary_.\n\n    We are all docile dough-faces,\n      They knead us with the fist,\n    They, the dashing southern lords,\n      We labor as they list;\n    For them we speak--or hold our tongues,\n      For them we turn and twist.\n\n    We join them in their howl against\n      Free soil and \"abolition,\"\n    That firebrand--that assassin knife--\n      Which risk our land's condition,\n    And leave no peace of life to any\n      Dough-faced politician.\n\n    To put down \"agitation,\" now,\n      We think the most judicious;\n    To damn all \"northern fanatics,\"\n      Those \"traitors\" black and vicious;\n    The \"reg'lar party usages\"\n      For us, and no \"new issues.\"\n\n    Things have come to a pretty pass,\n      When a trifle small as this,\n    Moving and bartering nigger slaves,\n      Can open an abyss,\n    With jaws a-gape for \"the two great parties;\"\n      A pretty thought, I wis!\n\n    Principle--freedom!--fiddlesticks!\n      We know not where they're found.\n    Rights of the masses--progress!--bah!\n      Words that tickle and sound;\n    But claiming to rule o'er \"practical men\"\n      Is very different ground.\n\n    Beyond all such we know a term\n      Charming to ears and eyes,\n    With it we'll stab young Freedom,\n      And do it in disguise;\n\n    Speak soft, ye wily dough-faces--\n      That term is \"compromise.\"\n\n    And what if children, growing up,\n      In future seasons read\n    The thing we do? and heart and tongue\n      Accurse us for the deed?\n    The future cannot touch us;\n      The present gain we heed.\n\n    Then, all together, dough-faces!\n      Let's stop the exciting clatter,\n    And pacify slave-breeding wrath\n      By yielding all the matter;\n    For otherwise, as sure as guns,\n      The Union it will shatter.\n\n    Besides, to tell the honest truth\n      (For us an innovation,)\n    Keeping in with the slave power\n      Is our personal salvation;\n    We've very little to expect\n      From t' other part of the nation.\n\n    Besides it's plain at Washington\n      Who likeliest wins the race,\n    What earthly chance has \"free soil\"\n      For any good fat place?\n    While many a daw has feather'd his nest,\n      By his creamy and meek dough-face.\n\n    Take heart, then, sweet companions,\n      Be steady, Scripture Dick!\n    Webster, Cooper, Walker,\n      To your allegiance stick!\n    With Brooks, and Briggs and Phoenix,\n      Stand up through thin and thick!\n\n    We do not ask a bold brave front;\n      We never try that game;\n    'Twould bring the storm upon our heads,\n      A huge mad storm of shame;\n    Evade it, brothers--\"compromise\"\n      Will answer just the same.\n\nPAUMANOK.\n\n\nDEATH IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM (_A Fact_)\n\nTing-a-ling-ling-ling! went the little bell on the teacher's desk of a\nvillage-school one morning, when the studies of the earlier part of the\nday were about half completed. It was well understood that this was a\ncommand for silence and attention; and when these had been obtained, the\nmaster spoke. He was a low thick-set man, and his name was Lugare.\n\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"I have had a complaint enter'd, that last night some\nof you were stealing fruit from Mr. Nichols's garden. I rather think I\nknow the thief. Tim Barker, step up here, sir.\"\n\nThe one to whom he spoke came forward. He was a slight, fair-looking boy\nof about thirteen; and his face had a laughing, good-humor'd expression,\nwhich even the charge now preferr'd against him, and the stern tone\nand threatening look of the teacher, had not entirely dissipated. The\ncountenance of the boy, however, was too unearthly fair for health; it\nhad, notwithstanding its fleshy, cheerful look, a singular cast as if\nsome inward disease, and that a fearful one, were seated within. As the\nstripling stood before that place of judgment--that place so often\nmade the scene of heartless and coarse brutality, of timid innocence\nconfused, helpless child-hood outraged, and gentle feelings crush'\nd--Lugare looked on him with a frown which plainly told that he felt in\nno very pleasant mood. (Happily a worthier and more philosophical system\nis proving to men that schools can be better govern'd than by lashes and\ntears and sighs. We are waxing toward that consummation when one of the\nold-fashion'd school-masters, with his cowhide, his heavy birch-rod,\nand his many ingenious methods of child-torture, will be gazed upon as\na scorn'd memento of an ignorant, cruel, and exploded doctrine. May\npropitious gales speed that day!)\n\n\"Were you by Mr. Nichols's garden-fence last night?\" said Lugare.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answer'd the boy, \"I was.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I'm glad to find you so ready with your confession. And\nso you thought you could do a little robbing, and enjoy yourself in a\nmanner you ought to be ashamed to own, without being punish'd, did you?\"\n\n\"I have not been robbing,\" replied the boy quickly. His face was\nsuffused, whether with resentment or fright, it was difficult to tell.\n\"And I didn't do anything last night, that I am ashamed to own.\"\n\n\"No impudence!\" exclaim'd the teacher, passionately, as he grasp'd a\nlong and heavy ratan: \"give me none of your sharp speeches, or I'll\nthrash you till you beg like a dog.\"\n\nThe youngster's face paled a little; his lip quiver'd, but he did not\nspeak.\n\n\"And pray, sir,\" continued Lugare, as the outward signs of wrath\ndisappear'd from his features; \"what were you about the garden for?\nPerhaps you only receiv'd the plunder, and had an accomplice to do the\nmore dangerous part of the job?\"\n\n\"I went that way because it is on my road home. I was there again\nafterwards to meet an acquaintance; and--and--But I did not go into the\ngarden, nor take anything away from it. I would not steal,--hardly to\nsave myself from starving.\"\n\n\"You had better have stuck to that last evening. You were seen, Tim\nBarker, to come from under Mr. Nichols's garden-fence, a little after\nnine o'clock, with a bag full of something or other over your shoulders.\nThe bag had every appearance of being filled with fruit, and this\nmorning the melon-beds are found to have been completely clear'd. Now,\nsir, what was there in that bag?\"\n\nLike fire itself glow'd the face of the detected lad. He spoke not a\nword. All the school had their eyes directed at him. The perspiration\nran down his white forehead like rain-drops.\n\n\"Speak, sir!\" exclaimed Lugare, with a loud strike of his ratan on the\ndesk.\n\nThe boy look'd as though he would faint. But the unmerciful teacher,\nconfident of having brought to light a criminal, and exulting in\nthe idea of the severe chastisement he should now be justified in\ninflicting, kept working himself up to a still greater and greater\ndegree of passion. In the meantime, the child seem'd hardly to know what\nto do with himself. His tongue cleav'd to the roof of his mouth. Either\nhe was very much frighten'd, or he was actually unwell.\n\n\"Speak, I say!\" again thunder'd Lugare; and his hand, grasping his\nratan, tower'd above his head in a very significant manner.\n\n\"I hardly can, sir,\" said the poor fellow faintly. His voice was husky\nand thick. \"I will tell you some--some other time. Please let me go to\nmy seat--I a'n't well.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; that's very likely;\" and Mr. Lugare bulged out his nose and\ncheeks with contempt. \"Do you think to make me believe your lies? I've\nfound you out, sir, plainly enough; and I am satisfied that you are as\nprecious a little villain as there is in the State. But I will postpone\nsettling with you for an hour yet. I shall then call you up again;\nand if you don't tell the whole truth then, I will give you something\nthat'll make you remember Mr. Nichols's melons for many a month to\ncome:--go to your seat.\"\n\nGlad enough of the ungracious permission, and answering not a sound,\nthe child crept tremblingly to his bench. He felt very strangely,\ndizzily--more as if he was in a dream than in real life; and laying his\narms on his desk, bow'd down his face between them. The pupils turn'd\nto their accustom'd studies, for during the reign of Lugare in the\nvillage-school, they had been so used to scenes of violence and severe\nchastisement, that such things made but little interruption in the tenor\nof their way.\n\nNow, while the intervening hour is passing, we will clear up the mystery\nof the bag, and of young Barker being under the garden fence on the\npreceding night. The boy's mother was a widow, and they both had to live\nin the very narrowest limits. His father had died when he was six years\nold, and little Tim was left a sickly emaciated infant whom no one\nexpected to live many months. To the surprise of all, however, the poor\nchild kept alive, and seem'd to recover his health, as he certainly\ndid his size and good looks. This was owing to the kind offices of an\neminent physician who had a country-seat in the neighborhood, and who\nhad been interested in the widow's little family. Tim, the physician\nsaid, might possibly outgrow his disease; but everything was uncertain.\nIt was a mysterious and baffling malady; and it would not be wonderful\nif he should in some moment of apparent health be suddenly taken away.\nThe poor widow was at first in a continual state of uneasiness; but\nseveral years had now pass'd, and none of the impending evils had fallen\nupon the boy's head. His mother seem'd to feel confident that he would\nlive, and be a help and an honor to her old age; and the two struggled\non together, mutually happy in each other, and enduring much of poverty\nand discomfort without repining, each for the other's sake.\n\nTim's pleasant disposition had made him many friends in the village, and\namong the rest a young fanner named Jones, who, with his elder brother,\nwork'd a large farm in the neighborhood on shares. Jones very frequently\nmade Tim a present of a bag of potatoes or corn, or some garden\nvegetables, which he took from his own stock; but as his partner was a\nparsimonious, high-tempered man, and had often said that Tim was an\nidle fellow, and ought not to be help'd because he did not work, Jones\ngenerally made his gifts in such a manner that no one knew anything\nabout them, except himself and the grateful objects of his kindness.\nIt might be, too, that the widow was both to have it understood by the\nneighbors that she received food from anyone; for there is often an\nexcusable pride in people of her condition which makes them shrink from\nbeing consider'd as objects of \"charity\" as they would from the severest\npains. On the night in question, Tim had been told that Jones would send\nthem a bag of potatoes, and the place at which they were to be waiting\nfor him was fixed at Mr. Nichols's garden-fence. It was this bag that\nTim had been seen staggering under, and which caused the unlucky boy to\nbe accused and convicted by his teacher as a thief. That teacher was one\nlittle fitted for his important and responsible office. Hasty to decide,\nand inflexibly severe, he was the terror of the little world he ruled\nso despotically. Punishment he seemed to delight in. Knowing little of\nthose sweet fountains which in children's breasts ever open quickly\nat the call of gentleness and kind words, he was fear'd by all for his\nsternness, and loved by none. I would that he were an isolated instance\nin his profession.\n\nThe hour of grace had drawn to its close, and the time approach'd at\nwhich it was usual for Lugare to give his school a joyfully-receiv'd\ndismission. Now and then one of the scholars would direct a furtive\nglance at Tim, sometimes in pity, sometimes in indifference or inquiry.\nThey knew that he would have no mercy shown him, and though most of them\nloved him, whipping was too common there to exact much sympathy. Every\ninquiring glance, however, remain'd unsatisfied, for at the end of the\nhour, Tim remain'd with his face completely hidden, and his head bow'd\nin his arms, precisely as he had lean'd himself when he first went\nto his seat. Lugare look'd at the boy occasionally with a scowl which\nseem'd to bode vengeance for his sullenness. At length the last class\nhad been heard, and the last lesson recited, and Lugare seated himself\nbehind his desk on the platform, with his longest and stoutest ratan\nbefore him.\n\n\"Now, Barker,\" he said, \"we'll settle that little business of yours.\nJust step up here.\"\n\nTim did not move. The school-room was as still as the grave. Not a sound\nwas to be heard, except occasionally a long-drawn breath.\n\n\"Mind me, sir, or it will be the worse for you. Step up here, and take\noff your jacket!\"\n\nThe boy did not stir any more than if he had been of wood. Lugare shook\nwith passion. He sat still a minute, as if considering the best way to\nwreak his vengeance. That minute, passed in death-like silence, was\na fearful one to some of the children, for their faces whiten'd with\nfright. It seem'd, as it slowly dropp'd away, like the minute which\nprecedes the climax of an exquisitely-performed tragedy, when some\nmighty master of the histrionic art is treading the stage, and you\nand the multitude around you are waiting, with stretch'd nerves and\nsuspended breath, in expectation of the terrible catastrophe.\n\n\"Tim is asleep, sir,\" at length said one of the boys who sat near him.\nLugare, at this intelligence, allow'd his features to relax from their\nexpression of savage anger into a smile, but that smile look'd more\nmalignant if possible, than his former scowls. It might be that he felt\namused at the horror depicted on the faces of those about him; or\nit might be that he was gloating in pleasure on the way in which he\nintended to wake the slumberer.\n\n\"Asleep! are you, my young gentleman!\" said he; \"let us see if we can't\nfind something to tickle your eyes open. There's nothing like making the\nbest of a bad case, boys. Tim, here, is determin'd not to be worried in\nhis mind about a little flogging, for the thought of it can't even keep\nthe little scoundrel awake.\"\n\nLugare smiled again as he made the last observation. He grasp'd his\nratan firmly, and descended from his seat. With light and stealthy steps\nhe cross'd the room and stood by the unlucky sleeper. The boy was still\nas unconscious of his impending punishment as ever. He might be dreaming\nsome golden dream of youth and pleasure; perhaps he was far away in the\nworld of fancy, seeing scenes, and feeling delights, which cold reality\nnever can bestow. Lugare lifted his ratan high over his head, and with\nthe true and expert aim which he had acquired by long practice, brought\nit down on Tim's back with a force and whacking sound which seem'd\nsufficient to wake a freezing man in his last lethargy. Quick and fast,\nblow foliow'd blow. Without waiting to see the effect of the first cut,\nthe brutal wretch plied his instrument of torture first on one side of\nthe boy's back, and then on the other, and only stopped at the end of\ntwo or three minutes from very weariness. But still Tim show'd no signs\nof motion; and as Lugare, provoked at his torpidity, jerk'd away one of\nthe child's arms, on which he had been leaning over the desk, his head\ndropp'd down on the board with a dull sound, and his face lay turn'd up\nand exposed to view. When Lugare saw it, he stood like one transfix'd\nby a basilisk. His countenance turn'd to a leaden whiteness; the ratan\ndropp'd from his grasp; and his eyes, stretch'd wide open, glared as at\nsome monstrous spectacle of horror and death. The sweat started in\ngreat globules seemingly from every pore in his face; his skinny lips\ncontracted, and show'd his teeth; and when he at length stretch'd forth\nhis arm, and with the end of one of his fingers touch'd the child's\ncheek, each limb quiver'd like the tongue of a snake; and his strength\nseemed as though it would momentarily fail him. The boy was dead. He\nhad probably been so for some time, for his eyes were turn'd up, and his\nbody was quite cold. Death was in the school-room, and Lugare had been\nflogging A CORPSE.\n\n-_Democratic Review, August, 1841._\n\n\nONE WICKED IMPULSE\n\nThat section of Nassau street which runs into the great mart of New York\nbrokers and stock-jobbers, has for a long time been much occupied by\npractitioners of the law. Tolerably well-known amid this class some\nyears since, was Adam Covert, a middle-aged man of rather limited means,\nwho, to tell the truth, gained more by trickery than he did in the\nlegitimate and honorable exercise of his profession. He was a tall,\nbilious-faced widower; the father of two children; and had lately been\nseeking to better his fortunes by a rich marriage. But somehow or other\nhis wooing did not seem to thrive well, and, with perhaps one exception,\nthe lawyer's prospects in the matrimonial way were hopelessly gloomy.\n\nAmong the early clients of Mr. Covert had been a distant relative named\nMarsh, who, dying somewhat suddenly, left his son and daughter, and some\nlittle property, to the care of Covert, under a will drawn out by that\ngentleman himself. At no time caught without his eyes open, the cunning\nlawyer, aided by much sad confusion in the emergency which had caused\nhis services to be called for, and disguising his object under a cloud\nof technicalities, inserted provisions in the will, giving himself an\nalmost arbitrary control over the property and over those for whom it\nwas designed. This control was even made to extend beyond the time when\nthe children would arrive at mature age. The son, Philip, a spirited and\nhigh-temper'd fellow, had some time since pass'd that age. Esther,\nthe girl, a plain, and somewhat devotional young woman, was in her\nnineteenth year.\n\nHaving such power over his wards, Covert did not scruple openly to use\nhis advantage, in pressing his claims as a suitor for Esther's hand.\nSince the death of Marsh, the property he left, which had been in real\nestate, and was to be divided equally between the brother and sister,\nhad risen to very considerable value; and Esther's share was to a man in\nCovert's situation a prize very well worth seeking. All this time, while\nreally owning a respectable income, the young orphans often felt the\nwant of the smallest sum of money--and Esther, on Philip's account, was\nmore than once driven to various contrivances--the pawn-shop, sales of\nher own little luxuries, and the like, to furnish him with means.\n\nThough she had frequently shown her guardian unequivocal evidence of her\naversion, Esther continued to suffer from his persecutions, until one\nday he proceeded farther and was more pressing than usual. She possess'd\nsome of her brother's mettlesome temper, and gave him an abrupt and most\ndecided refusal. With dignity, she exposed the baseness of his conduct,\nand forbade him ever again mentioning marriage to her. He retorted\nbitterly, vaunted his hold on her and Philip, and swore an oath that\nunless she became his wife, they should both thenceforward become\npenniless. Losing his habitual self-control in his exasperation, he even\nadded insults such as woman never receives from any one deserving the\nname of man, and at his own convenience left the house. That day, Philip\nreturn'd to New York, after an absence of several weeks on the business\nof a mercantile house in whose employment he had lately engaged.\n\nToward the latter part of the same afternoon, Mr. Covert was sitting in\nhis office, in Nassau street, busily at work, when a knock at the door\nannounc'd a visitor, and directly afterward young Marsh enter'd the\nroom. His face exhibited a peculiar pallid appearance that did not\nstrike Covert at all agreeably, and he call'd his clerk from an\nadjoining room, and gave him something to do at a desk near by.\n\n\"I wish to see you alone, Mr. Covert, if convenient,\" said the newcomer.\n\n\"We can talk quite well enough where we are,\" answer'd the lawyer;\n\"indeed, I don't know that I have any leisure to talk at all, for just\nnow I am very much press'd with business.\"\n\n\"But I _must_ speak to you,\" rejoined Philip sternly, \"at least I must\nsay one thing, and that is, Mr. Covert, that you are a villain!\"\n\n\"Insolent!\" exclaimed the lawyer, rising behind the table, and pointing\nto the door. \"Do you see that, sir? Let one minute longer find you\nthe other side, or your feet may reach the landing by quicker method.\nBegone, sir!\"\n\nSuch a threat was the more harsh to Philip, for he had rather\nhigh-strung feelings of honor. He grew almost livid with suppress'd\nagitation.\n\n\"I will see you again very soon,\" said he, in a low but distinct manner,\nhis lips trembling as he spoke; and left the office.\n\nThe incidents of the rest of that pleasant summer day left little\nimpression on the young man's mind. He roam'd to and fro without any\nobject or destination. Along South street and by Whitehall, he watch'd\nwith curious eyes the movements of the shipping, and the loading and\nunloading of cargoes; and listen'd to the merry heave-yo of the sailors\nand stevedores. There are some minds upon which great excitement\nproduces the singular effect of uniting two utterly inconsistent\nfaculties--a sort of cold apathy, and a sharp sensitiveness to all that\nis going on at the same time. Philip's was one of this sort; he\nnoticed the various differences in the apparel of a gang of\nwharf-laborers--turn'd over in his brain whether they receiv'd wages\nenough to keep them comfortable, and their families also--and if they\nhad families or not, which he tried to tell by their looks. In such\npetty reflections the daylight passed away. And all the while the master\nwish of Philip's thoughts was a desire to see the lawyer Covert. For\nwhat purpose he himself was by no means clear.\n\nNightfall came at last. Still, however, the young man did not direct\nhis steps homeward. He felt more calm, however, and entering an eating\nhouse, order'd something for his supper, which, when it was brought to\nhim, he merely tasted, and stroll'd forth again. There was a kind of\ngnawing sensation of thirst within him yet, and as he pass'd a hotel, he\nbethought him that one little glass of spirits would perhaps be just the\nthing. He drank, and hour after hour wore away unconsciously; he drank\nnot one glass, but three or four, and strong glasses they were to him,\nfor he was habitually abstemious.\n\nIt had been a hot day and evening, and when Philip, at an advanced\nperiod of the night, emerged from the bar-room into the street, he\nfound that a thunderstorm had just commenced. He resolutely walk'd on,\nhowever, although at every step it grew more and more blustering.\n\nThe rain now pour'd down a cataract; the shops were all shut; few of\nthe street lamps were lighted; and there was little except the frequent\nflashes of lightning to show him his way. When about half the length of\nChatham street, which lay in the direction he had to take, the momentary\nfury of the tempest forced him to turn aside into a sort of shelter\nform'd by the corners of the deep entrance to a Jew pawnbroker's shop\nthere. He had hardly drawn himself in as closely as possible, when\nthe lightning revealed to him that the opposite corner of the nook was\ntenanted also.\n\n\"A sharp rain, this,\" said the other occupant, who simultaneously beheld\nPhilip.\n\nThe voice sounded to the young man's ears a note which almost made him\nsober again. It was certainly the voice of Adam Covert. He made some\ncommonplace reply, and waited for another flash of lightning to show him\nthe stranger's face. It came, and he saw that his companion was indeed\nhis guardian.\n\nPhilip Marsh had drank deeply--(let us plead all that may be possible\nto you, stern moralist.) Upon his mind came swarming, and he could not\ndrive them away, thoughts of all those insults his sister had told him\nof, and the bitter words Covert had spoken to her; he reflected, too,\non the injuries Esther as well as himself had receiv'd, and were\nstill likely to receive, at the hands of that bold, bad man; how\nmean, selfish, and unprincipled was his character--what base and cruel\nadvantages he had taken of many poor people, entangled in his power,\nand of how much wrong and suffering he had been the author, and might be\nagain through future years. The very turmoil of the elements, the harsh\nroll of the thunder, the vindictive beating of the rain, and the fierce\nglare of the wild fluid that seem'd to riot in the ferocity of the storm\naround him, kindled a strange sympathetic fury in the young man's mind.\nHeaven itself (so deranged were his imaginations) appear'd to have\nprovided a fitting scene and time for a deed of retribution, which to\nhis disorder'd passion half wore the semblance of a divine justice. He\nremember'd not the ready solution to be found in Covert's pressure of\nbusiness, which had no doubt kept him later than usual; but fancied some\nmysterious intent in the ordaining that he should be there, and that\nthey two should meet at that untimely hour. All this whirl of influence\ncame over Philip with startling quickness at that horrid moment. He\nstepp'd to the side of his guardian.\n\n\"Ho!\" said he, \"have we met so soon, Mr. Covert? You traitor to my dead\nfather--robber of his children! I fear to think on what I think now!\"\n\nThe lawyer's natural effrontery did not desert him.\n\n\"Unless you'd like to spend a night in the watch-house, young\ngentleman,\" said he, after a short pause, \"move on. Your father was a\nweak man, I remember; as for his son, his own wicked heart is his worst\nfoe. I have never done wrong to either--that I can say, and swear it!\"\n\n\"Insolent liar!\" exclaimed Philip, his eye flashing out sparks of fire\nin the darkness.\n\nCovert made no reply except a cool, contemptuous laugh, which stung\nthe excited young man to double fury. He sprang upon the lawyer, and\nclutch'd him by the neckcloth.\n\n\"Take it, then!\" he cried hoarsely, for his throat was impeded by the\nfiendish rage which in that black hour possess'd him. \"You are not fit\nto live!\"\n\nHe dragg'd his guardian to the earth and fell crushingly upon him,\nchoking the shriek the poor victim but just began to utter. Then, with\nmonstrous imprecations, he twisted a tight knot around the gasping\ncreature's neck, drew a clasp knife from his pocket, and touching the\nspring, the long sharp blade, too eager for its bloody work, flew open.\n\nDuring the lull of the storm, the last strength of the prostrate man\nburst forth into one short loud cry of agony. At the same instant, the\narm of the murderer thrust the blade, once, twice, thrice, deep in his\nenemy's bosom! Not a minute had passed since that fatal exasperating\nlaugh--but the deed was done, and the instinctive thought which came at\nonce to the guilty one, was a thought of fear and escape.\n\nIn the unearthly pause which follow'd, Philip's eyes gave one long\nsearching sweep in every direction, above and around him. _Above_! God\nof the all-seeing eye! What, and who was that figure there?\n\n\"Forbear! In Jehovah's name forbear;\" cried a shrill, but clear and\nmelodious voice.\n\nIt was as if some accusing spirit had come down to bear witness against\nthe deed of blood. Leaning far out of an open window, appear' d a white\ndraperied shape, its face possess'd of a wonderful youthful beauty.\nLong vivid glows of lightning gave Philip a full opportunity to see as\nclearly as though the sun had been shining at noonday. One hand of the\nfigure was raised upward in a deprecating attitude, and his large bright\nblack eyes bent down upon the scene below with an expression of horror\nand shrinking pain. Such heavenly looks, and the peculiar circumstance\nof the time, fill'd Philip's heart with awe.\n\n\"Oh, if it is not yet too late,\" spoke the youth again, \"spare him. In\nGod's voice, I command, 'Thou shalt do no murder!'\"\n\nThe words rang like a knell in the ear of the terror-stricken and\nalready remorseful Philip. Springing from the body, he gave a second\nglance up and down the walk, which was totally lonesome and deserted;\nthen crossing into Reade street, he made his fearful way in a half state\nof stupor, half-bewilderment, by the nearest avenues to his home.\n\nWhen the corpse of the murder'd lawyer was found in the morning, and the\nofficers of justice commenced their inquiry, suspicion immediately fell\nupon Philip, and he was arrested. The most rigorous search, however,\nbrought to light nothing at all implicating the young man, except his\nvisit to Covert's office the evening before, and his angry language\nthere. That was by no means enough to fix so heavy a charge upon him.\n\nThe second day afterward, the whole business came before the ordinary\njudicial tribunal, in order that Philip might be either committed for\nthe crime, or discharged. The testimony of Mr. Covert's clerk stood\nalone. One of his employers, who, believing in his innocence, had\ndeserted him not in this crisis, had provided him with the ablest\ncriminal counsel in New York. The proof was declared entirely\ninsufficient, and Philip was discharged.\n\nThe crowded court-room made way for him as he came out; hundreds of\ncurious looks fixed upon his features, and many a jibe pass'd upon him.\nBut of all that arena of human faces, he saw only _one_--a sad, pale,\nblack-eyed one, cowering in the centre of the rest. He had seen that\nface twice before--the first time as a warning spectre--the second time\nin prison, immediately after his arrest--now for the _last_ time. This\nyoung stranger--the son of a scorn'd race--coming to the court-room to\nperform an unhappy duty, with the intention of testifying to what he\nhad seen, melted at the sight of Philip's bloodless cheek, and of his\nsister's convulsive sobs, and forbore witnessing against the murderer.\nShall we applaud or condemn him? Let every reader answer the question\nfor himself.\n\nThat afternoon Philip left New York. His friendly employer own'd a small\nfarm some miles up the Hudson, and until the excitement of the affair\nwas over, he advised the young man to go thither. Philip thankfully\naccepted the proposal, made a few preparations, took a hurried leave of\nEsther, and by nightfall was settled in his new abode.\n\nAnd how, think you, rested Philip Marsh that night? _Rested_ indeed! O,\nif those who clamor so much for the halter and the scaffold to punish\ncrime, could have seen that sight, they might have learn'd a lesson\nthen! Four days had elapsed since he that lay tossing upon the bed there\nhad slumber'd. Not the slightest intermission had come to his awaken'd\nand tensely strung sense, during those frightful days. Disturb'd waking\ndreams came to him, as he thought what he might do to gain his lost\npeace. Far, far away would he go! The cold roll of the murder'd\nman's eye, as it turn'd up its last glance into his face--the shrill\nexclamation of pain--all the unearthly vividness of the posture,\nmotions, and looks of the dead--the warning voice from above--pursued\nhim like tormenting furies, and were never absent from his mind, asleep\nor awake, that long weary night. Anything, any place, to escape such\nhorrid companionship! He would travel inland--hire himself to do hard\ndrudgery upon some farm--work incessantly through the wide summer days,\nand thus force nature to bestow oblivion upon his senses, at least a\nlittle while now and then. He would fly on, on, on, until amid different\nscenes and a new life, the old memories were rubb'd entirely out. He\nwould fight bravely in himself for peace of mind. For peace he would\nlabor and struggle--for peace he would pray!\n\nAt length after a feverish slumber of some thirty or forty minutes, the\nunhappy youth, waking with a nervous start, rais'd himself in bed, and\nsaw the blessed daylight beginning to dawn. He felt the sweat trickling\ndown his naked breast; the sheet where he had lain was quite wet with\nit. Dragging himself wearily, he open'd the window. Ah! that good\nmorning air--how it refresh'd him--how he lean'd out, and drank in the\nfragrance of the blossoms below, and almost for the first time in his\nlife felt how beautifully indeed God had made the earth, and that there\nwas wonderful sweetness in mere existence. And amidst the thousand mute\nmouths and eloquent eyes, which appear'd as it were to look up and speak\nin every direction, he fancied so many invitations to come among them.\n\nNot without effort, for he was very weak, he dress'd himself, and issued\nforth into the open air.\n\nClouds of pale gold and transparent crimson draperied the eastern sky,\nbut the sun, whose face gladden'd them into all that glory, was not yet\nabove the horizon. It was a time and place of such rare, such Eden-like\nbeauty! Philip paused at the summit of an upward slope, and gazed around\nhim. Some few miles off he could see a gleam of the Hudson river, and\nabove it a spur of those rugged cliffs scatter'd along its western\nshores. Nearer by were cultivated fields. The clover grew richly there,\nthe young grain bent to the early breeze, and the air was filled with an\nintoxicating perfume. At his side was the large well-kept garden of his\nhost, in which were many pretty flowers, grass plots, and a wide avenue\nof noble trees. As Philip gazed, the holy calming power of Nature--the\ninvisible spirit of so much beauty and so much innocence, melted into\nhis soul. The disturb'd passions and the feverish conflict subsided. He\neven felt something like envied peace of mind--a sort of joy even in\nthe presence of all the unmarr'd goodness. It was as fair to him, guilty\nthough he had been, as to the purest of the pure. No accusing frowns\nshow'd in the face of the flowers, or in the green shrubs, or\nthe branches of the trees. They, more forgiving than mankind, and\ndistinguishing not between the children of darkness and the children of\nlight--they at least treated him with gentleness. Was he, then, a being\nso accurs'd? Involuntarily, he bent over a branch of red roses, and took\nthem softly between his hands--those murderous, bloody hands! But the\nred roses neither wither'd nor smell'd less fragiant. And as the young\nman kiss'd them, and dropp'd a tear upon them, it seem'd to him that he\nhad found pity and sympathy from Heaven itself.\n\nThough against all the rules of story-writing, we continue our narrative\nof these mainly true incidents (for such they are,) no further. Only to\nsay that _the murderer_ soon departed for a new field of action--that\nhe is still living--and that this is but one of thousands of cases of\nunravel'd, unpunish'd crime--left, not to the tribunals of man, but to a\nwider power and judgment.\n\n\nTHE LAST LOYALIST\n\n[\"_She came to me last night, The floor gave back no tread_.\"] The story\nI am going to tell is a traditional reminiscence of a country place, in\nmy rambles about which I have often passed the house, now unoccupied,\nand mostly in ruins, that was the scene of the transaction. I cannot,\nof course, convey to others that particular kind of influence which is\nderived from my being so familiar with the locality, and with the very\npeople whose grandfathers or fathers were contemporaries of the actors\nin the drama I shall transcribe. I must hardly expect, therefore, that\nto those who hear it thro' the medium of my pen, the narration will\npossess as life-like and interesting a character as it does to myself.\n\nOn a large and fertile neck of land that juts out in the Sound,\nstretching to the east of New York city, there stood, in the latter part\nof the last century, an old-fashion'd country-residence. It had been\nbuilt by one of the first settlers of this section of the New World; and\nits occupant was originally owner of the extensive tract lying adjacent\nto his house, and pushing into the bosom of the salt waters. It was\nduring the troubled times which mark'd our American Revolution that\nthe incidents occurr'd which are the foundation of my story. Some\ntime before the commencement of the war, the owner, whom I shall call\nVanhome, was taken sick and died. For some time before his death he had\nlived a widower; and his only child, a lad of ten years old, was thus\nleft an orphan. By his father's will this child was placed implicitly\nunder the guardianship of an uncle, a middle-aged man, who had been\nof late a resident in the family. His care and interest, however, were\nneeded but a little while--not two years claps'd after the parents were\nlaid away to their last repose before another grave had to be prepared\nfor the son--the child who had been so haplessly deprived of their\nfostering care.\n\nThe period now arrived when the great national convulsion burst\nforth. Sounds of strife and the clash of arms, and the angry voices of\ndisputants, were borne along by the air, and week after week grew to\nstill louder clamor. Families were divided; adherents to the crown, and\nardent upholders of the rebellion, were often found in the bosom of the\nsame domestic circle. Vanhome, the uncle spoken of as guardian to the\nyoung heir, was a man who lean'd to the stern, the high-handed and the\nsevere. He soon became known among the most energetic of the loyalists.\nSo decided were his sentiments that, leaving the estate which he had\ninherited from his brother and nephew, he join'd the forces of the\nBritish king. Thenceforward, whenever his old neighbors heard of him, it\nwas as being engaged in the cruelest outrages, the boldest inroads, or\nthe most determin'd attacks upon the army of his countrymen or their\npeaceful settlements. Eight years brought the rebel States and their\nleaders to that glorious epoch when the last remnant of a monarch's rule\nwas to leave their shores--when the last waving of the royal standard\nwas to flutter as it should be haul'd down from the staff, and its place\nfill'd by the proud testimonial of our warriors' success.\n\nPleasantly over the autumn fields shone the November sun, when a\nhorseman, of somewhat military look, plodded slowly along the road that\nled to the old Vanhome farmhouse. There was nothing peculiar in his\nattire, unless it might be a red scarf which he wore tied round his\nwaist. He was a dark-featured, sullen-eyed man; and as his glance was\nthrown restlessly to the right and left, his whole manner appear'd to\nbe that of a person moving amid familiar and accustom'd scenes.\nOccasionally he stopp'd, and looking long and steadily at some object\nthat attracted his attention, mutter'd to himself, like one in whose\nbreast busy thoughts were moving. His course was evidently to the\nhomestead itself, at which in due time he arrived. He dismounted, led\nhis horse to the stables, and then, without knocking, though there were\nevident signs of occupancy around the building, the traveler made his\nentrance as composedly and boldly as though he were master of the whole\nestablishment.\n\nNow the house being in a measure deserted for many years, and the\nsuccessful termination of the strife rendering it probable that the\nVanhome estate would be confiscated to the new government, an aged,\npoverty-stricken couple had been encouraged by the neighbors to take\npossession as tenants of the place. Their name was Gills; and these\npeople the traveler found upon his entrance were likely to be his host\nand hostess. Holding their right as they did by so slight a tenure,\nthey ventur'd to offer no opposition when the stranger signified his\nintention of passing several hours there.\n\nThe day wore on, and the sun went down in the west; still the\ninterloper, gloomy and taciturn, made no signs of departing. But as\nthe evening advanced (whether the darkness was congenial to his sombre\nthoughts, or whether it merely chanced so) he seem'd to grow more\naffable and communicative, and informed Gills that he should pass the\nnight there, tendering him at the same time ample remuneration, which\nthe latter accepted with many thanks.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said he to his aged host, when they were all sitting around\nthe ample hearth, at the conclusion of their evening meal, \"tell me\nsomething to while away the hours.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir,\" answered Gills, \"this is no place for new or interesting\nevents. We live here from year to year, and at the end of one we find\nourselves at about the same place which we filled in the beginning.\"\n\n\"Can you relate nothing, then?\" rejoin'd the guest, and a singular\nsmile pass'd over his features; \"can you say nothing about your own\nplace?--this house or its former inhabitants, or former history?\"\n\nThe old man glanced across to his wife, and a look expressive of\nsympathetic feeling started in the face of each.\n\n\"It is an unfortunate story, sir,\" said Gills, \"and may cast a chill\nupon you, instead of the pleasant feeling which it would be best to\nfoster when in strange walls.\"\n\n\"Strange walls!\" echoed he of the red scarf, and for the first time\nsince his arrival he half laughed, but it was not the laugh which comes\nfrom a man's heart.\n\n\"You must know, sir,\" continued Gills, \"I am myself a sort of intruder\nhere. The Vanhomes--that was the name of the former residents and\nowners--I have never seen; for when I came to these parts the last\noccupant had left to join the red-coat soldiery. I am told that he is\nto sail with them for foreign lands, now that the war is ended, and his\nproperty almost certain to pass into other hands.\"\n\nAs the old man went on, the stranger cast down his eyes, and listen'd\nwith an appearance of great interest, though a transient smile or a\nbrightening of the eye would occasionally disturb the serenity of his\ndeportment.\n\n\"The old owners of this place,\" continued the white-haired narrator,\n\"were well off in the world, and bore a good name among their neighbors.\nThe brother of Sergeant Vanhome, now the only one of the name, died ten\nor twelve years since, leaving a son--a child so small that the father's\nwillmade provision for his being brought up by his uncle, whom I\nmention'd but now as of the British army. He was a strange man, this\nuncle; disliked by all who knew him; passionate, vindictive, and, it was\nsaid, very avaricious, even from his childhood.\n\n\"Well, not long after the death of the parents, dark stories began to\nbe circulated about cruelty and punishment and whippings and starvation\ninflicted by the new master upon his nephew. People who had business\nat the homestead would frequently, when they came away, relate the most\nfearful things of its manager, and how he misused his brother's child.\nIt was half hinted that he strove to get the youngster out of the way in\norder that the whole estate might fall into his own hands. As I told you\nbefore, however, nobody liked the man; and perhaps they judged him too\nuncharitably.\n\n\"After things had gone on in this way for some time, a countryman,\na laborer, who was hired to do farm-work upon the place, one evening\nobserved that the little orphan Vanhome was more faint and pale even\nthan usual, for he was always delicate, and that is one reason why I\nthink it possible that his death, of which I am now going to tell you,\nwas but the result of his own weak constitution, and nothing else. The\nlaborer slept that night at the farmhouse. Just before the time at which\nthey usually retired to bed, this person, feeling sleepy with his day's\ntoil, left the kitchen hearth and wended his way to rest. In going to\nhis place of repose he had to pass a chamber--the very chamber where\nyou, sir, are to sleep to-night--and there he heard the voice of the\norphan child uttering half-suppress'd exclamations as if in pitiful\nentreaty. Upon stopping, he heard also the tones of the elder Vanhome,\nbut they were harsh and bitter. The sound of blows followed. As each one\nfell it was accompanied by a groan or shriek, and so they continued for\nsome time. Shock'd and indignant, the countryman would have burst\nopen the door and interfered to prevent this brutal proceeding, but he\nbethought him that he might get himself into trouble, and perhaps find\nthat he could do no good after all, and so he passed on to his room.\n\n\"Well, sir, the following day the child did not come out among the\nwork-people as usual. He was taken very ill. No physician was sent for\nuntil the next afternoon; and though one arrived in the course of the\nnight, it was too late--the poor boy died before morning.\n\n\"People talk'd threateningly upon the subject, but nothing could be\nproved against Vanhome. At one period there were efforts made to have\nthe whole affair investigated. Perhaps that would have taken place, had\nnot every one's attention been swallow'd up by the rumors of difficulty\nand war, which were then beginning to disturb the country.\n\n\"Vanhome joined the army of the king. His enemies said that he feared to\nbe on the side of the rebels, because if they were routed his property\nwould be taken from him. But events have shown that, if this was indeed\nwhat he dreaded, it has happen'd to him from the very means which he\ntook to prevent it.\"\n\nThe old man paused. He had quite wearied himself with so long talking.\nFor some minutes there was unbroken silence. Presently the stranger\nsignified his intention of retiring for the night. He rose, and his host\ntook a light for the purpose of ushering him to his apartment.\n\nWhen Gills return'd to his accustom'd situation in the large arm-chair\nby the chimney-hearth, his ancient helpmate had retired to rest. With\nthe simplicity of their times, the bed stood in the same room where the\nthree had been seated during the last few hours; and now the remaining\ntwo talk'd together about the singular events of the evening. As the\ntime wore on, Gills show'd no disposition to leave his cosy chair;\nbut sat toasting his feet, and bending over the coals. Gradually the\ninsidious heat and the lateness of the hour began to exercise their\ninfluence over the old man. The drowsy indolent feeling which every one\nhas experienced in getting thoroughly heated through by close contact\nwith a glowing fire, spread in each vein and sinew, and relax'd its\ntone. He lean'd back in his chair and slept.\n\nFor a long time his repose went on quietly and soundly. He could not\ntell how many hours elapsed; but, a while after midnight, the torpid\nsenses of the slumberer were awaken'd by a startling shock. It was a\ncry as of a strong man in his agony--a shrill, not very loud cry, but\nfearful, and creeping into the blood like cold, polish'd steel. The old\nman raised himself in his seat and listen'd, at once fully awake. For a\nminute, all was the solemn stillness of midnight. Then rose that horrid\ntone again, wailing and wild, and making the hearer's hair to stand on\nend. One moment more, and the trampling of hasty feet sounded in the\npassage outside. The door was thrown open, and the form of the stranger,\nmore like a corpse than living man, rushed into the room.\n\n\"All white!\" yell'd the conscience-stricken creature--\"all white, and\nwith the grave-clothes around him. One shoulder was bare, and I saw,\"\nhe whisper'd, \"I saw blue streaks upon it. It was horrible, and I cried\naloud. He stepp'd toward me! He came to my very bedside; his small hand\nalmost touch'd my face. I could not bear it, and fled.\"\n\nThe miserable man bent his head down upon his bosom; convulsive\nrattlings shook his throat; and his whole frame waver'd to and fro\nlike a tree in a storm. Bewilder'd and shock'd, Gills look'd at his\napparently deranged guest, and knew not what answer to make, or what\ncourse of conduct to pursue.\n\nThrusting out his arms and his extended fingers, and bending down\nhis eyes, as men do when shading them from a glare of lightning, the\nstranger stagger'd from the door, and, in a moment further, dash'd madly\nthrough the passage which led through the kitchen into the outer road.\nThe old man heard the noise of his falling footsteps, sounding fainter\nand fainter in the distance, and then, retreating, dropp'd his own\nexhausted limbs into the chair from which he had been arous'd so\nterribly. It was many minutes before his energies recover'd their\naccustomed tone again. Strangely enough, his wife, unawaken'd by the\nstranger's ravings, still slumber'd on as profoundly as ever.\n\nPass we on to a far different scene--the embarkation of the British\ntroops for the distant land whose monarch was never more to wield the\nsceptre over a kingdom lost by his imprudence and tyranny. With frowning\nbrow and sullen pace the martial ranks moved on. Boat after boat was\nfilled, and, as each discharged its complement in the ships that lay\nheaving their anchors in the stream, it return'd, and was soon filled\nwith another load. And at length it became time for the last soldier\nto lift his eye and take a last glance at the broad banner of England's\npride, which flapp'd its folds from the top of the highest staff on the\nBattery.\n\nAs the warning sound of a trumpet called together all who were\nlaggards--those taking leave of friends, and those who were arranging\ntheir own private affairs, left until the last moment--a single\nhorseman was seen furiously dashing down the street. A red scarf tightly\nencircled his waist. He made directly for the shore, and the crowd\nthere gather'd started back in wonderment as they beheld his dishevel'd\nappearance and ghastly face. Throwing himself violently from his saddle,\nhe flung the bridle over the animal's neck, and gave him a sharp cut\nwith a small riding whip. He made for the boat; one minute later, and he\nhad been left. They were pushing the keel from the landing--the stranger\nsprang--a space of two or three feet already intervened--he struck on\nthe gunwale--and the Last Soldier of King George had left the American\nshores.\n\n\nWILD FRANK'S RETURN\n\nAs the sun, one August day some fifty years ago, had just pass'd the\nmeridian of a country town in the eastern section of Long Island, a\nsingle traveler came up to the quaint low-roof'd village tavern, open'd\nits half-door, and enter'd the common room. Dust cover'd the clothes of\nthe wayfarer, and his brow was moist with sweat. He trod in a lagging,\nweary way; though his form and features told of an age not more than\nnineteen or twenty years. Over one shoulder was slung a sailor's jacket,\nand in his hand he carried a little bundle. Sitting down on a rude\nbench, he told a female who made her appearance behind the bar, that\nhe would have a glass of brandy and sugar. He took off the liquor at a\ndraught: after which he lit and began to smoke a cigar, with which he\nsupplied himself from his pocket--stretching out one leg, and leaning\nhis elbow down on the bench, in the attitude of a man who takes an\nindolent lounge.\n\n\"Do you know one Richard Hall that lives somewhere here among you?\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Mr. Hall's is down the lane that turns off by that big locust tree,\"\nanswer'd the woman, pointing to the direction through the open door;\n\"it's about half a mile from here to his house.\"\n\nThe youth, for a minute or two, puff'd the smoke from his mouth very\nleisurely in silence. His manner had an air of vacant self-sufficiency,\nrather strange in one of so few years.\n\n\"I wish to see Mr. Hall,\" he said at length--\"Here's a silver six-pence,\nfor any one who will carry a message to him.\"\n\n\"The folks are all away. It's but a short walk, and your limbs are\nyoung,\" replied the female, who was not altogether pleased with the easy\nway of making himself at home which mark'd her shabby-looking customer.\nThat individual, however, seem'd to give small attention to the hint,\nbut lean'd and puff'd his cigar-smoke as leisurely as before.\n\n\"Unless,\" continued the woman, catching a second glance at the sixpence;\n\"unless old Joe is at the stable, as he's very likely to be. I'll go\nand find out for you.\" And she push'd open a door at her back, stepp'd\nthrough an adjoining room into a yard, whence her voice was the next\nmoment heard calling the person she had mention'd, in accents by no\nmeans remarkable for their melody or softness.\n\nHer search was successful. She soon return'd with him who was to act as\nmessenger--a little, wither'd, ragged old man--a hanger-on there,\nwhose unshaven face told plainly enough the story of his intemperate\nhabits--those deeply seated habits, now too late to be uprooted, that\nwould ere long lay him in a drunkard's grave. The youth inform'd him\nwhat the required service was, and promised him the reward as soon as he\nshould return,\n\n\"Tell Richard Hall that I am going to his father's house this afternoon.\nIf he asks who it is that wishes him here, say the person sent no name,\"\ncontinued the stranger, sitting up from his indolent posture, as the\nfeet of old Joe were about leaving the door-stone, and his blear'd eyes\nturned to eaten the last sentence of the mandate.\n\n\"And yet, perhaps you may as well,\" added he, communing a moment with\nhimself: \"you may tell him his brother Frank, Wild Frank, it is, who\nwishes him to come.\"\n\nThe old man departed on his errand, and he who call'd himself Wild\nFrank, toss'd his nearly smoked cigar out of the window, and folded his\narms in thought.\n\nNo better place than this, probably, will occur to give a brief account\nof some former events in the life of the young stranger, resting and\nwaiting at the village inn. Fifteen miles east of that inn lived a\nfarmer named Hall, a man of good repute, well-off in the world, and head\nof a large family. He was fond of gain--required all his boys to labor\nin proportion to their age; and his right hand man, if he might not\nbe called favorite, was his eldest son Richard. This eldest son, an\nindustrious, sober-faced young fellow, was invested by his father with\nthe powers of second in command; and as strict and swift obedience was\na prime tenet in the farmer's domestic government, the children all\ntacitly submitted to their brother's sway--all but one, and that was\nFrank. The farmer's wife was a quiet woman, in rather tender health; and\nthough for all her offspring she had a mother's love, Frank's kiss\never seem'd sweetest to her lips. She favor'd him more than the\nrest--perhaps, as in a hundred similar instances, for his being so often\nat fault, and so often blamed. In truth, however, he seldom receiv'd\nmore blame than he deserv'd, for he was a capricious, high-temper'd lad,\nand up to all kinds of mischief. From these traits he was known in the\nneighborhood by the name of Wild Frank.\n\nAmong the farmer's stock there was a fine young blood mare--a beautiful\ncreature, large and graceful, with eyes like dark-hued jewels, and her\ncolor that of the deep night. It being the custom of the farmer to let\nhis boys have something about the farm that they could call their\nown, and take care of as such, Black Nell, as the mare was called, had\nsomehow or other fallen to Frank's share. He was very proud of her, and\nthought as much of her comfort as his own. The elder brother, however,\nsaw fit to claim for himself, and several times to exercise, a privilege\nof managing and using Black Nell, notwithstanding what Frank consider'd\nhis prerogative. On one of these occasions a hot dispute arose, and,\nafter much angry blood, it was referr'd to the farmer for settlement. He\ndecided in favor of Richard, and added a harsh lecture to his other son.\nThe farmer was really unjust; and Wild Frank's face paled with rage and\nmortification. That furious temper which he had never been taught\nto curb, now swell'd like an overflowing torrent. With difficulty\nrestraining the exhibition of his passions, as soon as he got by himself\nhe swore that not another sun should roll by and find him under that\nroof. Late at night he silently arose, and turning his back on what he\nthought an inhospitable home, in mood in which the child should never\nleave the parental roof, bent his steps toward the city.\n\nIt may well be imagined that alarm and grief pervaded the whole of the\nfamily, on discovering Frank's departure. And as week after week melted\naway and brought no tidings of him, his poor mother's heart grew wearier\nand wearier. She spoke not much, but was evidently sick in spirit.\nNearly two years had claps'd when about a week before the incidents\nat the commencement of this story, the farmer's family were joyfully\nsurprised by receiving a letter from the long absent son. He had been\nto sea, and was then in New York, at which port his vessel had just\narrived. He wrote in a gay strain; appear'd to have lost the angry\nfeeling which caused his flight from home; and said he heard in the city\nthat Richard had married, and settled several miles distant, where he\nwished him all good luck and happiness. Wild Frank wound up his letter\nby promising, as soon as he could get through the imperative business of\nhis ship, to pay a visit to his parents and native place. On Tuesday of\nthe succeeding week, he said he would be with them.\n\nWithin half an hour after the departure of old Joe, the form of that\nancient personage was seen slowly wheeling round the locust-tree at the\nend of the lane, accompanied by a stout young man in primitive homespun\napparel. The meeting between Wild Frank and his brother Richard, though\nhardly of that kind which generally takes place between persons so\nclosely related, could not exactly be call'd distant or cool either.\nRichard press'd his brother to go with him to the farmhouse, and refresh\nand repose himself for some hours at least, but Frank declined.\n\n\"They will all expect me home this afternoon,\" he said, \"I wrote to them\nI would be there to-day.\"\n\n\"But you must be very tired, Frank,\" rejoin'd the other; \"won't you\nlet some of us harness up and carry you? Or if you like--\" he stopp'd\na moment, and a trifling suffusion spread over his face; \"if you like,\nI'll put the saddle on Black Nell--she's here at my place now, and you\ncan ride home like a lord.\"\n\nFrank's face color'd a little, too. He paused for a moment in\nthought--he was really foot-sore, and exhausted with his journey that\nhot day--so he accepted his brother's offer.\n\n\"You know the speed of Nell, as well as I,\" said Richard; \"I'll warrant\nwhen I bring her here you'll say she's in good order as ever.\" So\ntelling him to amuse himself for a few minutes as well as he could,\nRichard left the tavern.\n\nCould it be that Black Nell knew her early master? She neigh'd and\nrubb'd her nose on his shoulder; and as he put his foot in the stirrup\nand rose on her back, it was evident that they were both highly pleased\nwith their meeting. Bidding his brother farewell, and not forgetting old\nJoe, the young man set forth on his journey to his father's house. As he\nleft the village behind, and came upon the long monotonous road before\nhim, he thought on the circumstances of his leaving home--and he\nthought, too, on his course of life, how it was being frittered away\nand lost. Very gentle influences, doubtless, came over Wild Frank's\nmind then, and he yearn'd to show his parents that he was sorry for the\ntrouble he had cost them. He blamed himself for his former follies, and\neven felt remorse that he had not acted more kindly to Richard, and gone\nto his house. Oh, it had been a sad mistake of the farmer that he did\nnot teach his children to love one another. It was a foolish thing\nthat he prided himself on governing his little flock well, when sweet\naffection, gentle forbearance, and brotherly faith, were almost unknown\namong them.\n\nThe day was now advanced, though the heat pour'd down with a strength\nlittle less oppressive than at noon. Frank had accomplish'd the greater\npart of his journey; he was within two miles of his home. The road here\nled over a high, tiresome hill, and he determined to stop on the top of\nit and rest himself, as well as give the animal he rode a few minutes'\nbreath. How well he knew the place! And that mighty oak, standing just\noutside the fence on the very summit of the hill, often had he reposed\nunder its shade. It would be pleasant for a few minutes to stretch his\nlimbs there again as of old, he thought to himself; and he dismounted\nfrom the saddle and led Black Nell under the tree. Mindful of the\ncomfort of his favorite, he took from his little bundle, which he had\nstrapped behind him on the mare's back, a piece of strong cord, four or\nfive yards in length, which he tied to the bridle, and wound and tied\nthe other end, for security, over his own wrist; then throwing himself\nat full length upon the ground, Black Nell was at liberty to graze\naround him, without danger of straying away.\n\nIt was a calm scene, and a pleasant. There was no rude sound--hardly\neven a chirping insect--to break the sleepy silence of the place. The\natmosphere had a dim, hazy cast, and was impregnated with overpowering\nheat. The young man lay there minute after minute, as time glided away\nunnoticed; for he was very tired, and his repose was sweet to him.\nOccasionally he raised himself and cast a listless look at the distant\nlandscape, veil'd as it was by the slight mist. At length his repose was\nwithout such interruptions. His eyes closed, and though at first they\nopen'd languidly again at intervals, after a while they shut altogether.\nCould it be that he slept? It was so indeed. Yielding to the drowsy\ninfluences about him, and to his prolong'd weariness of travel, he had\nfallen into a deep, sound slumber. Thus he lay; and Black Nell, the\noriginal cause of his departure from his home--by a singular chance, the\ncompanion of his return--quietly cropp'd the grass at his side.\n\nAn hour nearly pass'd away, and yet the young man slept on. The light\nand heat were not glaring now; a change had come over earth and heaven.\nThere were signs of one of those thunderstorms that in our climate\nspring up and pass over so quickly and so terribly. Masses of vapor\nloom' d up in the horizon, and a dark shadow settled on the woods and\nfields. The leaves of the great oak rustled together over the youth's\nhead. Clouds flitted swiftly in the sky, like bodies of armed men coming\nup to battle at the call of their leader's trumpet. A thick rain-drop\nfell now and then, while occasionally hoarse mutterings of thunder\nsounded in the distance; yet the slumberer was not arous'd. It was\nstrange that Wild Frank did not awake. Perhaps his ocean life had taught\nhim to rest undisturbed amid the jarring of elements. Though the storm\nwas now coming on in its fury, he slept like a babe in its cradle.\n\nBlack Nell had ceased grazing, and stood by her sleeping master with\nears erect, and her long mane and tail waving in the wind. It seem'd\nquite dark, so heavy were the clouds. The blast blew sweepingly, the\nlightning flash'd, and the rain fell in torrents. Crash after crash of\nthunder seem'd to shake the solid earth. And Black Nell, she stood now,\nan image of beautiful terror, with her fore feet thrust out, her neck\narch'd, and her eyes glaring balls of fear. At length, after a dazzling\nand lurid glare, there came a peal--a deafening crash--as if the great\naxle was rent. God of Spirits! the startled mare sprang off like a ship\nin an ocean-storm! Her eyes were blinded with light; she dashed madly\ndown the hill, and plunge after plunge--far, far away--swift as an\narrow--dragging the hapless body of the youth behind her!\n\nIn the low, old-fashion'd dwelling of the farmer there was a large\nfamily group. The men and boys had gather'd under shelter at the\napproach of the storm; and the subject of their talk was the return\nof the long absent son. The mother spoke of him, too, and her eyes\nbrighten'd with pleasure as she spoke. She made all the little domestic\npreparations--cook'd his favorite dishes--and arranged for him his\nown bed, in its own old place. As the tempest mounted to its fury they\ndiscuss'd the probability of his getting soak'd by it; and the provident\ndame had already selected some dry garments for a change. But the rain\nwas soon over, and nature smiled again in her invigorated beauty. The\nsun shone out as it was dipping in the west. Drops sparkled on the\nleaf-tips--coolness and clearness were in the air.\n\nThe clattering of a horse's hoofs came to the ears of those who were\ngather'd there. It was on the other side of the house that the wagon\nroad lead; and they open'd the door and rush'd in a tumult of glad\nanticipations, through the adjoining room to the porch. What a sight it\nwas that met them there! Black Nell stood a few feet from the door, with\nher neck crouch'd down; she drew her breath long and deep, and vapor\nrose from every part of her reeking body. And with eyes starting from\ntheir sockets, and mouths agape with stupefying terror, they beheld on\nthe ground near her a mangled, hideous mass--the rough semblance of a\nhuman form--all batter'd, and cut, and bloody. Attach'd to it was the\nfatal cord, dabbled over with gore. And as the mother gazed--for she\ncould not withdraw her eyes--and the appalling truth came upon her mind,\nshe sank down without shriek or utterance, into a deep, deathly swoon.\n\n\nTHE BOY LOVER\n\nListen, and the old will speak a chronicle for the young. Ah, youth!\nthou art one day coming to be old, too. And let me tell thee how thou\nmayest get a useful lesson. For an hour, _dream thyself old_. Realize,\nin thy thoughts and consciousness, that vigor and strength are subdued\nin thy sinews--that the color of the shroud is liken'd in thy very\nhairs--that all those leaping desires, luxurious hopes, beautiful\naspirations, and proud confidences, of thy younger life, have long been\nburied (a funeral for the better part of thee) in that grave which must\nsoon close over thy tottering limbs. Look back, then, through the long\ntrack of the past years. How has it been with thee? Are there bright\nbeacons of happiness enjoy'd, and of good done by the way? Glimmer\ngentle rays of what was scatter'd from a holy heart? Have benevolence,\nand love, and undeviating honesty left tokens on which thy eyes can rest\nsweetly? Is it well with thee, thus? Answerest thou, it is? Or answerest\nthou, I see nothing but gloom and shatter'd hours, and the wreck of good\nresolves, and a broken heart, filled with sickness, and troubled among\nits ruined chambers with the phantoms of many follies?\n\nO, youth! youth! this dream will one day be a _reality_--a reality,\neither of heavenly peace or agonizing sorrow.\n\nAnd yet not for all is it decreed to attain the neighborhood of the\nthree-score and ten years--the span of life. I am to speak of one\nwho died young. Very awkward was his childhood--but most fragile and\nsensitive! So delicate a nature may exist in a rough, unnoticed plant!\nLet the boy rest;--he was not beautiful, and dropp'd away betimes. But\nfor the cause--it is a singular story, to which let crusted worldlings\npay the tribute of a light laugh--light and empty as their own hollow\nhearts.\n\nLove! which with its cankerseed of decay within, has sent young men\nand maidens to a long'd-for, but too premature burial. Love! the\nchild-monarch that Death itself cannot conquer; that has its tokens on\nslabs at the head of grass-cover'd tombs--tokens more visible to the\neye of the stranger, yet not so deeply graven as the face and the\nremembrances cut upon the heart of the living. Love! the sweet, the\npure, the innocent; yet the causer of fierce hate, of wishes for deadly\nrevenge, of bloody deeds, and madness, and the horrors of hell. Love!\nthat wanders over battlefields, turning up mangled human trunks, and\nparting back the hair from gory faces, and daring the points of swords\nand the thunder of artillery, without a fear or a thought of danger.\n\nWords! words! I begin to see I am, indeed, an old man, and garrulous!\nLet me go back--yes, I see it must be many years!\n\nIt was at the close of the last century. I was at that time studying\nlaw, the profession my father follow'd. One of his clients was an\nelderly widow, a foreigner, who kept a little ale-house, on the banks of\nthe North River, at about two miles from what is now the centre of the\ncity. Then the spot was quite out of town and surrounded by fields and\ngreen trees. The widow often invited me to come and pay her a visit,\nwhen I had a leisure afternoon--including also in the invitation my\nbrother and two other students who were in my father's office. Matthew,\nthe brother I mention, was a boy of sixteen; he was troubled with an\ninward illness--though it had no power over his temper, which ever\nretain' d the most admirable placidity and gentleness.\n\nHe was cheerful, but never boisterous, and everybody loved him; his mind\nseem'd more develop'd than is usual for his age, though his personal\nappearance was exceedingly plain. Wheaton and Brown, the names of the\nother students, were spirited, clever young fellows, with most of the\ntraits that those in their position of life generally possess. The\nfirst was as generous and brave as any man I ever knew. He was very\npassionate, too, but the whirlwind soon blew over, and left everything\nquiet again. Frank Brown was slim, graceful, and handsome. He profess'd\nto be fond of sentiment, and used to fall regularly in love once a\nmonth.\n\nThe half of every Wednesday we four youths had to ourselves, and were\nin the habit of taking a sail, a ride, or a walk together. One of these\nafternoons, of a pleasant day in April, the sun shining, and the air\nclear, I bethought myself of the widow and her beer--about which latter\narticle I had made inquiries, and heard it spoken of in terms of\nhigh commendation. I mention'd the matter to Matthew and to my\nfellow-students, and we agreed to fill up our holiday by a jaunt to the\nale-house. Accordingly, we set forth, and, after a fine walk, arrived in\nglorious spirits at our destination.\n\nAh! how shall I describe the quiet beauties of the spot, with its long,\nlow piazza looking out upon the river, and its clean homely tables,\nand the tankards of real silver in which the ale was given us, and the\nflavor of that excellent liquor itself. There was the widow; and there\nwas a sober, stately old woman, half companion, half servant, Margery\nby name; and there was (good God! my fingers quiver yet as I write the\nword!) young Ninon, the daughter of the widow.\n\nO, through the years that live no more, my memory strays back, and that\nwhole scene comes up before me once again-and the brightest part of\nthe picture is the strange ethereal beauty of that young girl! She\nwas apparently about the age of my brother Matthew, and the most\nfascinating, artless creature I had ever beheld. She had blue eyes and\nlight hair, and an expression of childish simplicity which was charming\nindeed. I have no doubt that ere half an hour had elapsed from the time\nwe enter'd the tavern and saw Ninon, every one of the four of us loved\nthe girl to the very depth of passion.\n\nWe neither spent so much money, nor drank as much beer, as we had\nintended before starting from home. The widow was very civil, being\npleased to see us, and Margery served our wants with a deal of\npoliteness--but it was to Ninon that the afternoon's pleasure was\nattributable; for though we were strangers, we became acquainted at\nonce--the manners of the girl, merry as she was, putting entirely out of\nview the most distant imputation of indecorum--and the presence of the\nwidow and Margery, (for we were all in the common room together, there\nbeing no other company,) serving to make us all disembarrass'd, and at\nease.\n\nIt was not until quite a while after sunset that we started on our\nreturn to the city. We made several attempts to revive the mirth and\nlively talk that usually signalized our rambles, but they seem'd forced\nand discordant, like laughter in a sick-room. My brother was the only\none who preserved his usual tenor of temper and conduct.\n\nI need hardly say that thenceforward every Wednesday afternoon was spent\nat the widow's tavern. Strangely, neither Matthew or my two friends, or\nmyself, spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference\nto Ninon. Yet we all knew the thoughts and feelings of the others; and\neach, perhaps, felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his\ncompanions.\n\nThe story of the widow was a touching yet simple one. She was by birth\na Swiss. In one of the cantons of her native land, she had grown up, and\nmarried, and lived for a time in happy comfort. A son was born to her,\nand a daughter, the beautiful Ninon. By some reverse of fortune, the\nfather and head of the family had the greater portion of his possessions\nswept from him. He struggled for a time against the evil influence, but\nit press'd upon him harder and harder. He had heard of a people in the\nwestern world--a new and swarming land--where the stranger was welcom'd,\nand peace and the protection of the strong arm thrown around him. He had\nnot heart to stay and struggle amid the scenes of his former prosperity,\nand he determin'd to go and make his home in that distant republic of\nthe west. So with his wife and children, and the proceeds of what little\nproperty was left, he took passage for New York. He was never to reach\nhis journey's end. Either the cares that weigh' d upon his mind, or some\nother cause, consign'd him to a sick hammock, from which he only found\nrelief through the Great Dismisser. He was buried in the sea, and in due\ntime his family arrived at the American emporium. But there, the son too\nsicken'd--died, ere long, and was buried likewise. They would not bury\nhim in the city, but away--by the solitary banks of the Hudson; on which\nthe widow soon afterwards took up her abode.\n\nNinon was too young to feel much grief at these sad occurrences; and the\nmother, whatever she might have suffer'd inwardly, had a good deal of\nphlegm and patience, and set about making herself and her remaining\nchild as comfortable as might be. They had still a respectable sum in\ncash, and after due deliberation, the widow purchas'd the little quiet\ntavern, not far from the grave of her boy; and of Sundays and holidays\nshe took in considerable money--enough to make a decent support for\nthem in their humble way of living. French and Germans visited the house\nfrequently, and quite a number of young Americans too. Probably the\ngreatest attraction to the latter was the sweet face of Ninon.\n\nSpring passed, and summer crept in and wasted away, and autumn had\narrived. Every New Yorker knows what delicious weather we have, in these\nregions, of the early October days; how calm, clear, and divested of\nsultriness, is the air, and how decently nature seems preparing for her\nwinter sleep.\n\nThus it was the last Wednesday we started on our accustomed excursion.\nSix months had elapsed since our first visit, and, as then, we were full\nof the exuberance of young and joyful hearts. Frequent and hearty were\nour jokes, by no means particular about the theme or the method, and\nlong and loud the peals of laughter that rang over the fields or along\nthe shore.\n\nWe took our seats round the same clean, white table, and received our\nfavorite beverage in the same bright tankards. They were set before us\nby the sober Margery, no one else being visible. As frequently happen'd,\nwe were the only company. Walking and breathing the keen, fine air had\nmade us dry, and we soon drain'd the foaming vessels, and call'd for\nmore. I remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that\nhad just made their appearance from a great British author, and were\ncreating quite a public stir. There was one, a tale of passion and\ndespair, which Wheaton had read, and of which he gave us a transcript.\nWild, startling, and dreamy, perhaps it threw over our minds its\npeculiar cast. An hour moved off, and we began to think it strange that\nneither Ninon or the widow came into the room. One of us gave a hint to\nthat effect to Margery; but she made no answer, and went on in her usual\nway as before.\n\n\"The grim old thing,\" said Wheaton, \"if she were in Spain, they'd make\nher a premier duenna!\"\n\nI ask'd the woman about Ninon and the widow. She seemed disturb'd, I\nthought; but, making no reply to the first part of my question, said\nthat her mistress was in another part of the house, and did not wish to\nbe with company.\n\n\"Then be kind enough, Mrs. Vinegar,\" resumed Wheaton, good-naturedly,\n\"be kind enough to go and ask the widow if we can see Ninon.\"\n\nOur attendant's face turn'd as pale as ashes, and she precipitately left\nthe apartment. We laugh'd at her agitation, which Frank Brown assigned\nto our merry ridicule.\n\nQuite a quarter of an hour elaps'd before Margery's return. When she\nappear'd she told us briefly that the widow had bidden her obey our\nbehest, and now, if we desired, she would conduct us to the daughter's\npresence. There was a singular expression in the woman's eyes, and\nthe whole affair began to strike us as somewhat odd; but we arose, and\ntaking our caps, follow'd her as she stepp'd through the door. Back of\nthe house were some fields, and a path leading into clumps of trees. At\nsome thirty rods distant from the tavern, nigh one of those clumps, the\nlarger tree whereof was a willow, Margery stopp'd, and pausing a minute,\nwhile we came up, spoke in tones calm and low:\n\n\"Ninon is there!\"\n\nShe pointed downward with her finger. Great God! There was a _grave_,\nnew made, and with the sods loosely join'd, and a rough brown stone at\neach extremity! Some earth yet lay upon the grass near by. If we had\nlook'd, we might have seen the resting-place of the widow's son, Ninon's\nbrother--for it was close at hand. But amid the whole scene our eyes\ntook in nothing except that horrible covering of death--the oven-shaped\nmound. My sight seemed to waver, my head felt dizzy, and a feeling of\ndeadly sickness came over me. I heard a stifled exclamation, and looking\nround, saw Frank Brown leaning against the nearest tree, great sweat\nupon his forehead, and his cheeks bloodless as chalk. Wheaton gave\nway to his agony more fully than ever I had known a man before; he had\nfallen--sobbing like a child, and wringing his hands. It is impossible\nto describe the suddenness and fearfulness of the sickening truth that\ncame upon us like a stroke of thunder.\n\nOf all of us, my brother Matthew neither shed tears, or turned pale,\nor fainted, or exposed any other evidence of inward depth of pain. His\nquiet, pleasant voice was indeed a tone lower, but it was that which\nrecall'd us, after the lapse of many long minutes, to ourselves.\n\nSo the girl had died and been buried. We were told of an illness that\nhad seized her the very day after our last preceding visit; but we\ninquired not into the particulars.\n\nAnd now come I to the conclusion of my story, and to the most singular\npart of it. The evening of the third day afterward, Wheaton, who had\nwept scalding tears, and Brown, whose cheeks had recovered their color,\nand myself, that for an hour thought my heart would never rebound again\nfrom the fearful shock--that evening, I say, we three were seated around\na table in another tavern, drinking other beer, and laughing but a\nlittle less cheerfully, and as though we had never known the widow or\nher daughter--neither of whom, I venture to affirm, came into our minds\nonce the whole night, or but to be dismiss'd again, carelessly, like the\nremembrance of faces seen in a crowd.\n\nStrange are the contradictions of the things of life! The seventh day\nafter that dreadful visit saw my brother Matthew--the delicate one, who,\nwhile bold men writhed in torture, had kept the same placid face, and\nthe same untrembling fingers--him that seventh day saw a clay-cold\ncorpse, carried to the repose of the churchyard. The shaft, rankling\nfar down and within, wrought a poison too great for show, and the youth\ndied.\n\n\nTHE CHILD AND THE PROFLIGATE\n\nJust after sunset, one evening in summer--that pleasant hour when the\nair is balmy, the light loses its glare, and all around is imbued with\nsoothing quiet--on the door-step of a house there sat an elderly woman\nwaiting the arrival of her son. The house was in a straggling village\nsome fifty miles from New York city. She who sat on the door-step was a\nwidow; her white cap cover'd locks of gray, and her dress, though clean,\nwas exceedingly homely. Her house--for the tenement she occupied was her\nown--was very little and very old. Trees clustered around it so thickly\nas almost to hide its color--that blackish gray color which belongs to\nold wooden houses that have never been painted; and to get in it you had\nto enter a little rickety gate and walk through a short path, border'd\nby carrot beds and beets and other vegetables. The son whom she was\nexpecting was her only child. About a year before he had been bound\napprentice to a rich farmer in the place, and after finishing his daily\ntask he was in the habit of spending half an hour at his mother's. On\nthe present occasion the shadows of night had settled heavily before the\nyouth made his appearance. When he did, his walk was slow and dragging,\nand all his motions were languid, as if from great weariness. He open'd\nthe gate, came through the path, and sat down by his mother in silence.\n\n\"You are sullen to-night, Charley,\" said the widow, after a moment's\npause, when she found that he return' d no answer to her greeting.\n\nAs she spoke she put her hand fondly on his head; it seem'd moist as if\nit had been dipp'd in the water. His shirt, too, was soak'd; and as\nshe pass'd her fingers down his shoulder she left a sharp twinge in her\nheart, for she knew that moisture to be the hard wrung sweat of severe\ntoil, exacted from her young child (he was but thirteen years old) by an\nunyielding taskmaster.\n\n\"You have work'd hard to-day, my son.\"\n\n\"I've been mowing.\"\n\nThe widow's heart felt another pang.\n\n\"Not _all day_, Charley?\" she said, in a low voice; and there was a\nslight quiver in it.\n\n\"Yes, mother, all day,\" replied the boy; \"Mr. Ellis said he couldn't\nafford to hire men, for wages are so high. I've swung the scythe ever\nsince an hour before sunrise. Feel of my hands.\"\n\nThere were blisters on them like great lumps. Tears started in the\nwidow's eyes. She dared not trust herself with a reply, though her heart\nwas bursting with the thought that she could not better his condition.\nThere was no earthly means of support on which she had dependence enough\nto encourage her child in the wish she knew he was forming--the wish not\nutter'd for the first time--to be freed from his bondage. \"Mother,\" at\nlength said the boy, \"I can stand it no longer. I cannot and will not\nstay at Mr. Ellis's. Ever since the day I first went into his house I've\nbeen a slave; and if I have to work so much longer I know I shall run\noff and go to sea or somewhere else. I'd as leave be in my grave as\nthere.\" And the child burst into a passionate fit of weeping.\n\nHis mother was silent, for she was in deep grief herself. After some\nminutes had flown, however, she gather'd sufficient self-possession to\nspeak to her son in a soothing tone, endeavoring to win him from his\nsorrows and cheer up his heart. She told him that time was swift--that\nin the course of a few years he would be his own master.--that all\npeople have their troubles--with many other ready arguments which,\nthough they had little effect in calming her own distress, she hoped\nwould act as a solace to the disturb'd temper of the boy. And as the\nhalf hour to which he was limited had now elaps'd, she took him by the\nhand and led him to the gate, to set forth on his return. The youth\nseemed pacified, though occasionally one of those convulsive sighs that\nremain after a fit of weeping, would break from his throat. At the gate\nhe threw his arms about his mother's neck; each press'd a long kiss\non the lips of the other, and the youngster bent his steps towards his\nmaster's house.\n\nAs her child pass'd out of sight the widow return'd, shut the gate and\nenter'd her lonely room. There was no light in the old cottage that\nnight--the heart of its occupant was dark and cheerless. Love, agony,\nand grief, and tears and convulsive wrestlings were there. The thought\nof a beloved son condemned to labor--labor that would break down a\nman--struggling from day to day under the hard rule of a soulless\ngold-worshipper; the knowledge that years must pass thus; the sickening\nidea of her own poverty, and of living mainly on the grudged charity of\nneighbors--thoughts, too, of former happy days--these rack'd the widow's\nheart, and made her bed a sleepless one without repose.\n\nThe boy bent his steps to his employer's, as has been said. In his way\ndown the village street he had to pass a public house, the only one the\nplace contain'd; and when he came off against it he heard the sound of\na fiddle--drown'd, however, at intervals, by much laughter and talking.\nThe windows were up, and, the house standing close to the road, Charles\nthought it no harm to take a look and see what was going on within. Half\na dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement, on which he lean'd\nhis elbow, and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants.\nIn one corner was an old man, known in the village as Black Dave--he\nit was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn Charles's\nattention to the tavern; and he it was who now exerted himself in a\nviolent manner to give, with divers flourishes and extra twangs, a tune\nvery popular among that thick-lipp'd race whose fondness for melody is\nso well known. In the middle of the room were five or six sailors, some\nof them quite drunk, and others in the earlier stages of that process,\nwhile on benches around were more sailors, and here and there a person\ndress'd in landsman's attire. The men in the middle of the room were\ndancing; that is, they were going through certain contortions and\nshufflings, varied occasionally by exceeding hearty stamps upon the\nsanded floor. In short the whole party were engaged in a drunken frolic,\nwhich was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken frolics,\nexcept, perhaps, that there was less than the ordinary amount of anger\nand quarreling. Indeed everyone seem' d in remarkably good humor.\n\nBut what excited the boy's attention more than any other object was an\nindividual, seated on one of the benches opposite, who, though evidently\nenjoying the spree as much as if he were an old hand at such business,\nseem' d in every other particular to be far out of his element. His\nappearance was youthful. He might have been twenty-one or two years\nold. His countenance was intelligent, and had the air of city life and\nsociety. He was dress'd not gaudily, but in every respect fashionably;\nhis coat being of the finest broadcloth, his linen delicate and spotless\nas snow, and his whole aspect that of one whose counterpart may now and\nthen be seen upon the pave in Broadway of a fine afternoon. He laugh'd\nand talk'd with the rest, and it must be confess'd his jokes--like the\nmost of those that pass'd current there--were by no means distinguish'd\nfor their refinement or purity. Near the door was a small table, cover'd\nwith decanters and glasses, some of which had been used, but were used\nagain indiscriminately, and a box of very thick and very long cigars.\n\nOne of the sailors--and it was he who made the largest share of the\nhubbub--had but one eye. His chin and cheeks were cover'd with huge,\nbushy whiskers, and altogether he had quite a brutal appearance. \"Come,\nboys,\" said this gentleman, \"come, let us take a drink. I know you're\nall a getting dry;\" and he clench'd his invitation with an appalling\noath. This politeness was responded to by a general moving of the\ncompany toward the table holding the before-mention'd decanters and\nglasses. Clustering there around, each one help'd himself to a very\nhandsome portion of that particular liquor which suited his fancy; and\nsteadiness and accuracy being at that moment by no means distinguishing\ntraits of the arms and legs of the party, a goodly amount of the fluid\nwas spill'd upon the floor. This piece of extravagance excited the ire\nof the personage who gave the \"treat;\" and that ire was still further\nincreas'd when he discover'd two or three loiterers who seem'd disposed\nto slight his request to drink. Charles, as we have before mention'd,\nwas looking in at the window.\n\n\"Walk up, boys! walk up! If there be any skulker among us, blast my eyes\nif he shan't go down on his marrow bones and taste the liquor we have\nspilt! Hallo!\" he exclaim'd as he spied Charles; \"hallo, you chap in the\nwindow, come here and take a sup.\"\n\nAs he spoke he stepp'd to the open casement, put his brawny hands under\nthe boy's arms, and lifted him into the room bodily.\n\n\"There, my lads,\" said he, turning to his companions, \"there's a new\nrecruit for you. Not so coarse a one, either,\" he added as he took a\nfair view of the boy, who, though not what is called pretty, was fresh\nand manly looking, and large for his age.\n\n\"Come, youngster, take a glass,\" he continued. And he pour'd one nearly\nfull of strong brandy.\n\nNow Charles was not exactly frighten'd, for he was a lively fellow, and\nhad often been at the country merry-makings, and at the parties of the\nplace; but he was certainly rather abash'd at his abrupt introduction to\nthe midst of strangers. So, putting the glass aside, he look'd up with a\npleasant smile in his new acquaintance's face.\n\n\"I've no need for anything now,\" he said, \"but I'm just as much obliged\nto you as if I was.\"\n\n\"Poh! man, drink it down,\" rejoin'd the sailor, \"drink it down--it won't\nhurt you.\"\n\nAnd, by way of showing its excellence, the one-eyed worthy drain'd it\nhimself to the last drop. Then filling it again, he renew'd his efforts\nto make the lad go through the same operation.\n\n\"I've no occasion. Besides, _my mother has often pray'd me not to\ndrink,_ and I promised to obey her.\"\n\nA little irritated by his continued refusal, the sailor, with a loud\noath, declared that Charles should swallow the brandy, whether he would\nor no. Placing one of his tremendous paws on the back of the boy's head,\nwith the other he thrust the edge of the glass to his lips, swearing\nat the same time, that if he shook it so as to spill its contents the\nconsequences would be of a nature by no means agreeable to his back and\nshoulders. Disliking the liquor, and angry at the attempt to overbear\nhim, the undaunted child lifted his hand and struck the arm of the\nsailor with a blow so sudden that the glass fell and was smash'd to\npieces on the floor; while the brandy was about equally divided between\nthe face of Charles, the clothes of the sailor, and the sand. By this\ntime the whole of the company had their attention drawn to the scene.\nSome of them laugh'd when they saw Charles's undisguised antipathy to\nthe drink; but they laugh'd still more heartily when he discomfited\nthe sailor. All of them, however, were content to let the matter go as\nchance would have it--all but the young man of the black coat, who has\nbeen spoken of.\n\nWhat was there in the words which Charles had spoken that carried the\nmind of the young man back to former times--to a period when he was\nmore pure and innocent than now? \"_My mother has often pray'd me not to\ndrink!_\" Ah, how the mist of months roll'd aside, and presented to his\nsoul's eye the picture of _his_ mother, and a prayer of exactly similar\npurport! Why was it, too, that the young man's heart moved with a\nfeeling of kindness toward the harshly treated child?\n\nCharles stood, his cheek flush'd and his heart throbbing, wiping the\ntrickling drops from his face with a handkerchief. At first the sailor,\nbetween his drunkenness and his surprise, was much in the condition\nof one suddenly awaken'd out of a deep sleep, who cannot call his\nconsciousness about him. When he saw the state of things, however, and\nheard the jeering laugh of his companions, his dull eye lighting up with\nanger, fell upon the boy who had withstood him. He seized Charles with\na grip of iron, and with the side of his heavy boot gave him a sharp and\nsolid kick. He was about repeating the performance--for the child\nhung like a rag in his grasp--but all of a sudden his ears rang, as if\npistols were snapp'd close to them; lights of various hues flicker'd\nin his eye, (he had but one, it will be remember'd,) and a strong\npropelling power caused him to move from his position, and keep moving\nuntil he was brought up by the wall. A blow, a cuff given in such a\nscientific manner that the hand from which it proceeded was evidently no\nstranger to the pugilistic art, had been suddenly planted in the ear of\nthe sailor. It was planted by the young man of the black coat. He had\nwatch'd with interest the proceeding of the sailor and the boy--two or\nthree times he was on the point of interfering; but when the kick was\ngiven, his rage was uncontrollable. He sprang from his seat in the\nattitude of a boxer--struck the sailor in a manner to cause those\nunpleasant sensations which have been described--and would probably have\nfollow'd up the attack, had not Charles, now thoroughly terrified, clung\naround his legs and prevented his advancing.\n\nThe scene was a strange one, and for the time quite a silent one. The\ncompany had started from their seats, and for a moment held breathless\nbut strain'd positions. In the middle of the room stood the young man,\nin his not at all ungraceful attitude--every nerve out, and his eyes\nflashing brilliantly.\n\nHe seem'd rooted like a rock; and clasping him, with an appearance of\nconfidence in his protection, clung the boy.\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" cried the young man, his voice thick with passion,\n\"dare to touch the boy again, and I'll thrash you till no sense is left\nin your body.\"\n\nThe sailor, now partially recover'd, made some gestures of a belligerent\nnature.\n\n\"Come on, drunken brute!\" continued the angry youth; \"I wish you would!\nYou've not had half what you deserve!\"\n\nUpon sobriety and sense more fully taking their power in the brains of\nthe one-eyed mariner, however, that worthy determined in his own\nmind that it would be most prudent to let the matter drop. Expressing\ntherefore his conviction to that effect, adding certain remarks to the\npurport that he \"meant no harm to the lad,\" that he was surprised\nat such a gentleman being angry at \"a little piece of fun,\" and so\nforth--he proposed that the company should go on with their jollity just\nas if nothing had happen'd. In truth, he of the single eye was not a\nbad fellow at heart, after all; the fiery enemy whose advances he had\nso often courted that night, had stolen away his good feelings, and set\nbusy devils at work within him, that might have made his hands do some\ndreadful deed, had not the stranger interposed.\n\nIn a few minutes the frolic of the party was upon its former footing.\nThe young man sat down upon one of the benches, with the boy by his\nside, and while the rest were loudly laughing and talking, they\ntwo convers'd together. The stranger learn'd from Charles all the\nparticulars of his simple story--how his father had died years\nsince--how his mother work' d hard for a bare living--and how he\nhimself, for many dreary months, had been the servant of a hard-hearted,\navaricious master. More and more interested, drawing the child close to\nhis side, the young man listen'd to his plainly told history--and thus\nan hour pass'd away.\n\nIt was now past midnight. The young man told Charles that on the morrow\nhe would take steps to relieve him from his servitude--that for the\npresent night the landlord would probably give him a lodging at the\ninn--and little persuading did the host need for that.\n\nAs he retired to sleep, very pleasant thoughts filled the mind of the\nyoung man--thoughts of a worthy action perform'd--thoughts, too, newly\nawakened ones, of walking in a steadier and wiser path than formerly.\n\nThat roof, then, sheltered two beings that night--one of them innocent\nand sinless of all wrong--the other--oh, to that other what evil had not\nbeen present, either in action or to his desires!\n\nWho was the stranger? To those that, from ties of relationship or\notherwise, felt an interest in him, the answer to that question was not\npleasant to dwell upon. His name was Langton--parentless--a dissipated\nyoung man--a brawler--one whose too frequent companions were rowdies,\nblacklegs, and swindlers. The New York police offices were not strangers\nto his countenance. He had been bred to the profession of medicine;\nbesides, he had a very respectable income, and his house was in a\npleasant street on the west side of the city. Little of his time,\nhowever, did Mr. John Langton spend at his domestic hearth; and the\nelderly lady who officiated as his housekeeper was by no means surprised\nto have him gone for a week or a month at a time, and she knowing\nnothing of his whereabouts.\n\nLiving as he did, the young man was an unhappy being. It was not so much\nthat his associates were below his own capacity--for Langton, though\nsensible and well bred, was not highly talented or refined--but that he\nlived without any steady purpose, that he had no one to attract him to\nhis home, that he too easily allow'd himself to be tempted--which caused\nhis life to be, of late, one continued scene of dissatisfaction. This\ndissatisfaction he sought to drive away by the brandy bottle, and mixing\nin all kinds of parties where the object was pleasure. On the present\noccasion he had left the city a few days before, and passing his time at\na place near the village where Charles and his mother lived. He fell in,\nduring the day, with those who were his companions of the tavern spree;\nand thus it happen'd that they were all together. Langton hesitated not\nto make himself at home with any associate that suited his fancy.\n\nThe next morning the poor widow rose from her sleepless cot; and from\nthat lucky trait in our nature which makes one extreme follow another,\nshe set about her toil with a lighten'd heart. Ellis, the farmer, rose,\ntoo, short as the nights were, an hour before day; for his god was gain,\nand a prime article of his creed was to get as much work as possible\nfrom every one around him. In the course of the day Ellis was called\nupon by young Langton, and never perhaps in his life was the farmer\npuzzled more than at the young man's proposal--his desire to provide for\nthe widow's family, a family that could do him no pecuniary good, and\nhis willingness to disburse money for that purpose. The widow, too, was\ncalled upon, not only on that day, but the next and the next.\n\nIt needs not that I should particularize the subsequent events of\nLangton's and the boy's history--how the reformation of the profligate\nmight be dated to begin from that time--how he gradually sever'd the\nguilty ties that had so long gall'd him--how he enjoy'd his own home\nagain--how the friendship of Charles and himself grew not slack with\ntime--and how, when in the course of seasons he became head of a family\nof his own, he would shudder at the remembrance of his early dangers and\nhis escapes.\n\n\nLINGAVE'S TEMPTATION\n\n\"Another day,\" utter'd the poet Lingave, as he awoke in the morning,\nand turn'd him drowsily on his hard pallet, \"another day comes out,\nburthen'd with its weight of woes. Of what use is existence to me?\nCrush'd down beneath the merciless heel of poverty, and no promise of\nhope to cheer me on, what have I in prospect but a life neglected and a\ndeath of misery?\"\n\nThe youth paused; but receiving no answer to his questions, thought\nproper to continue the peevish soliloquy. \"I am a genius, they say,\" and\nthe speaker smiled bitterly, \"but genius is not apparel and food. Why\nshould I exist in the world, unknown, unloved, press'd with cares, while\nso many around me have all their souls can desire? I behold the\nsplendid equipages roll by--I see the respectful bow at the presence of\npride--and I curse the contrast between my own lot, and the fortune\nof the rich. The lofty air--the show of dress--the aristocratic\ndemeanor--the glitter of jewels--dazzle my eyes; and sharp-tooth' d envy\nworks within me. I hate these haughty and favor'd ones. Why should my\npath be so much rougher than theirs? Pitiable, unfortunate man that I\nam! to be placed beneath those whom in my heart I despise--and to be\nconstantly tantalized with the presence of that wealth I cannot enjoy!\"\nAnd the poet cover'd his eyes with his hands, and wept from very passion\nand fretfulness.\n\nO, Lingave! be more of a man! Have you not the treasures of health and\nuntainted propensities, which many of those you envy never enjoy? Are\nyou not their superior in mental power, in liberal views of mankind, and\nin comprehensive intellect? And even allowing you the choice, how would\nyou shudder at changing, in total, conditions with them! Besides,\nwere you willing to devote all your time and energies, you could gain\nproperty too: squeeze, and toil, and worry, and twist everything into a\nmatter of profit, and you can become a great man, as far as money goes\nto make greatness.\n\nRetreat, then, man of the polish'd soul, from those irritable complaints\nagainst your lot-those longings for wealth and puerile distinction, not\nworthy your class. Do justice, philosopher, to your own powers. While\nthe world runs after its shadows and its bubbles, (thus commune in your\nown mind,) we will fold ourselves in our circle of understanding, and\nlook with an eye of apathy on those things it considers so mighty and\nso enviable. Let the proud man pass with his pompous glance--let the gay\nflutter in finery--let the foolish enjoy his folly, and the beautiful\nmove on in his perishing glory; we will gaze without desire on all their\npossessions, and all their pleasures. Our destiny is different from\ntheirs. Not for such as we, the lowly flights of their crippled wings.\nWe acknowledge no fellow-ship with them in ambition. We composedly look\ndown on the paths where they walk, and pursue our own, without uttering\na wish to descend, and be as they. What is it to us that the mass pay\nus not that deference which wealth commands? We desire no applause, save\nthe applause of the good and discriminating--the choice spirits among\nmen. Our intellect would be sullied, were the vulgar to approximate to\nit, by professing to readily enter in, and praising it. Our pride is a\ntowering, and thrice refined pride.\n\nWhen Lingave had given way to his temper some half hour, or thereabout,\nhe grew more calm, and bethought himself that he was acting a very silly\npart. He listen'd a moment to the clatter of the carts, and the tramp\nof early passengers on the pave below, as they wended along to commence\ntheir daily toil. It was just sunrise, and the season was summer. A\nlittle canary bird, the only pet poor Lingave could afford to keep,\nchirp'd merrily in its cage on the wall. How slight a circumstance will\nsometimes change the whole current of our thoughts! The music of that\nbird abstracting the mind of the poet but a moment from his sorrows,\ngave a chance for his natural buoyancy to act again.\n\nLingave sprang lightly from his bed, and perform'd his ablutions and his\nsimple toilet--then hanging the cage on a nail outside the window, and\nspeaking an endearment to the songster, which brought a perfect flood of\nmelody in return--he slowly passed through his door, descended the\nlong narrow turnings of the stairs, and stood in the open street.\nUndetermin'd as to any particular destination, he folded his hands\nbehind him, cast his glance upon the ground, and moved listlessly\nonward.\n\nHour after hour the poet walk'd along--up this street and down that--he\nreck'd not how or where. And as crowded thoroughfares are hardly the\nmost fit places for a man to let his fancy soar in the clouds--many a\npush and shove and curse did the dreamer get bestow'd upon him.\n\nThe booming of the city clock sounded forth the hour twelve--high noon.\n\n\"Ho! Lingave!\" cried a voice from an open basement window as the poet\npass'd.\n\nHe stopp'd, and then unwittingly would have walked on still, not fully\nawaken'd from his reverie.\n\n\"Lingave, I say!\" cried the voice again, and the person to whom the\nvoice belong'd stretch'd his head quite out into the area in front,\n\"Stop man. Have you forgotten your appointment?\"\n\n\"Oh! ah!\" said the poet, and he smiled unmeaningly, and descending\nthe steps, went into the office of Ridman, whose call it was that had\nstartled him in his walk.\n\nWho was Ridman? While the poet is waiting the convenience of that\npersonage, it may be as well to describe him.\n\nRidman was a _money-maker_. He had much penetration, considerable\nknowledge of the world, and a disposition to be constantly in the midst\nof enterprise, excitement, and stir. His schemes for gaining wealth were\nvarious; he had dipp'd into almost every branch and channel of business.\nA slight acquaintance of several years' standing subsisted between him\nand the poet. The day previous a boy had call'd with a note from Ridman\nto Lingave, desiring the presence of the latter at the money-maker's\nroom. The poet return'd for answer that he would be there. This was the\nengagement which he came near breaking.\n\nRidman had a smooth tongue. All his ingenuity was needed in the\nexplanation to his companion of why and wherefore the latter had been\nsent for.\n\nIt is not requisite to state specifically the offer made by the man\nof wealth to the poet. Ridman, in one of his enterprises, found it\nnecessary to procure the aid of such a person as Lingave--a writer of\npower, a master of elegant diction, of fine taste, in style passionate\nyet pure, and of the delicate imagery that belongs to the children of\nsong. The youth was absolutely startled at the magnificent and permanent\nremuneration which was held out to him for a moderate exercise of his\ntalents.\n\nBut the _nature_ of the service required! All the sophistry and art of\nRidman could not veil its repulsiveness. The poet was to labor for the\nadvancement of what he felt to be unholy--he was to inculcate what\nwould lower the perfection of man. He promised to give an answer to the\nproposal the succeeding day, and left the place.\n\nNow during the many hours there was a war going on in the heart of the\npoor poet. He was indeed poor; often he had no certainty whether he\nshould be able to procure the next day's meals. And the poet knew\nthe beauty of truth, and adored, not in the abstract merely, but in\npractice, the excellence of upright principles.\n\nNight came. Lingave, wearied, lay upon his pallet again and slept. The\nmisty veil thrown over him, the spirit of poesy came to his visions, and\nstood beside him, and look'd down pleasantly with her large eyes, which\nwere bright and liquid like the reflection of stars in a lake.\n\nVirtue, (such imagining, then, seem'd conscious to the soul of the\ndreamer,) is ever the sinew of true genius. Together, the two in one,\nthey are endow'd with immortal strength, and approach loftily to Him\nfrom whom both spring. Yet there are those that having great powers,\nbend them to the slavery of wrong. God forgive them! for they surely do\nit ignorantly or heedlessly. Oh, could he who lightly tosses around\nhim the seeds of evil in his writings, or his enduring thoughts, or his\nchance words--could he see how, haply, they are to spring up in distant\ntime and poison the air, and putrefy, and cause to sicken--would he not\nshrink back in horror? A bad principle, jestingly spoken--a falsehood,\nbut of a word--may taint a whole nation! Let the man to whom the great\nMaster has given the might of mind, beware how he uses that might. If\nfor the furtherance of bad ends, what can be expected but that, as\nthe hour of the closing scene draws nigh, thoughts of harm done, and\ncapacities distorted from their proper aim, and strength so laid out\nthat men must be worse instead of better, through the exertion of that\nstrength--will come and swarm like spectres around him?\n\n\"Be and continue poor, young man,\" so taught one whose counsels should\nbe graven on the heart of every youth, \"while others around you grow\nrich by fraud and disloyalty. Be without place and power, while others\nbeg their way upward. Bear the pain of disappointed hopes, while others\ngain the accomplishment of their flattery. Forego the gracious pressure\nof a hand, for which others cringe and crawl. Wrap yourself in your own\nvirtue, and seek a friend and your daily bread. If you have, in such a\ncourse, grown gray with unblench'd honor, bless God and die.\"\n\nWhen Lingave awoke the next morning, he despatch'd his answer to his\nwealthy friend, and then plodded on as in the days before.\n\n\nLITTLE JANE\n\n\"Lift up!\" was ejaculated as a signal! and click! went the glasses in\nthe hands of a party of tipsy men, drinking one night at the bar of one\nof the middling order of taverns. And many a wild gibe was utter'd, and\nmany a terrible blasphemy, and many an impure phrase sounded out the\npollution of the hearts of these half-crazed creatures, as they toss'd\ndown their liquor, and made the walls echo with their uproar. The first\nand foremost in recklessness was a girlish-faced, fair-hair'd fellow of\ntwenty-two or three years. They called him Mike. He seem'd to be look'd\nupon by the others as a sort of prompter, from whom they were to take\ncue. And if the brazen wickedness evinced by him in a hundred freaks\nand remarks to his companions, during their stay in that place, were any\ntest of his capacity--there might hardly be one more fit to go forward\nas a guide on the road of destruction. From the conversation of the\nparty, it appear'd that they had been spending the early part of the\nevening in a gambling house.\n\nA second, third and fourth time were the glasses fill'd; and the effect\nthereof began to be perceiv'd in a still higher degree of noise and\nloquacity among the revellers. One of the serving-men came in at this\nmoment, and whisper'd the barkeeper, who went out, and in a moment\nreturn'd again. \"A person,\" he said, \"wish'd to speak with Mr. Michael.\nHe waited on the walk in front.\"\n\nThe individual whose name was mention'd, made his excuses to the others,\ntelling them he would be back in a moment, and left the room. As he shut\nthe door behind him, and stepp'd into the open air, he saw one of his\nbrothers--his elder by eight or ten years--pacing to and fro with rapid\nand uneven steps. As the man turn'd in his walk, and the glare of the\nstreet lamp fell upon his face, the youth, half-benumb'd as his senses\nwere, was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation.\n\"Come with me!\" said the elder brother, hurriedly, \"the illness of our\nlittle Jane is worse, and I have been sent for you.\"\n\n\"Poh!\" answered the young drunkard, very composedly, \"is that all? I\nshall be home by-and-by,\" and he turn'd back again.\n\n\"But, brother, she is worse than ever before. Perhaps when you arrive\nshe may be dead.\"\n\nThe tipsy one paus'd in his retreat, perhaps alarm'd at the utterance\nof that dread word, which seldom fails to shoot a chill to the hearts of\nmortals. But he soon calm'd himself, and waving his hand to the other:\n\"Why, see,\" said he, \"a score of times at least, have I been call'd away\nto the last sickness of our good little sister; and each time it proves\nto be nothing worse than some whim of the nurse or physician. Three\nyears has the girl been able to live very heartily under her disease;\nand I'll be bound she'll stay on earth three years longer.\"\n\nAnd as he concluded this wicked and most brutal reply, the speaker\nopen'd the door and went into the bar-room. But in his intoxication,\nduring the hour that follow'd, Mike was far from being at ease. At\nthe end of that hour, the words, \"perhaps when you arrive she may be\n_dead_?\" were not effaced from his hearing yet, and he started for home.\nThe elder brother had wended his way back in sorrow.\n\nLet me go before the younger one, awhile, to a room in that home. A\nlittle girl lay there dying. She had been ill a long time; so it was no\nsudden thing for her parents, and her brethren and sisters, to be called\nfor the witness of the death agony. The girl was not what might be\ncalled beautiful. And yet, there is a solemn kind of loveliness that\nalways surrounds a sick child. The sympathy for the weak and helpless\nsufferer, perhaps, increases it in our own ideas. The ashiness and the\nmoisture on the brow, and the film over the eyeballs--what man can look\nupon the sight, and not feel his heart awed within him? Children, I have\nsometimes fancied too, increase in beauty as their illness deepens.\n\nBesides the nearest relatives of little Jane, standing round her\nbedside, was the family doctor. He had just laid her wrist down upon the\ncoverlet, and the look he gave the mother, was a look in which there was\nno hope. \"My child!\" she cried, in uncontrollable agony, \"O! my child!\"\nAnd the father, and the sons and daughters, were bowed down in grief,\nand thick tears rippled between the fingers held before their eyes.\n\nThen there was silence awhile. During the hour just by-gone, Jane had,\nin her childish way, bestow'd a little gift upon each of her kindred,\nas a remembrancer when she should be dead and buried in the grave.\nAnd there was one of these simple tokens which had not reach'd\nits destination. She held it in her hand now. It was a very small\nmuch-thumbed book--a religious story for infants, given her by her\nmother when she had first learn'd to read.\n\nWhile they were all keeping this solemn stillness-broken only by the\nsuppress'd sobs of those who stood and watch'd for the passing away of\nthe girl's soul--a confusion of some one entering rudely, and speaking\nin a turbulent voice, was heard in an adjoining apartment. Again the\nvoice roughly sounded out; it was the voice of the drunkard Mike, and\nthe father bade one of his sons go and quiet the intruder \"If nought\nelse will do,\" said he sternly, \"put him forth by strength. We want no\ntipsy brawlers here, to disturb such a scene as this.\" For what moved\nthe sick girl uneasily on her pillow, and raised her neck, and motion'd\nto her mother? She would that Mike should be brought to her side. And\nit was enjoin'd on him whom the father had bade to eject the noisy one,\nthat he should tell Mike his sister's request, and beg him to come to\nher.\n\nHe came. The inebriate--his mind sober'd by the deep solemnity of the\nscene--stood there, and leaned over to catch the last accounts of one\nwho soon was to be with the spirits of heaven. All was the silence of\nthe deepest night. The dying child held the young man's hand in one of\nhers; with the other she slowly lifted the trifling memorial she had\nassigned especially for him, aloft in the air. Her arm shook--her eyes,\nnow becoming glassy with the death-damps, were cast toward her brother's\nface. She smiled pleasantly, and as an indistinct gurgle came from\nher throat, the uplifted hand fell suddenly into the open palm of her\nbrother's, depositing the tiny volume there. Little Jane was dead.\n\nFrom that night, the young man stepped no more in his wild courses, but\nwas reform'd.\n\n\nDUMB KATE\n\nNot many years since--and yet long enough to have been before the\nabundance of railroads, and similar speedy modes of conveyance--the\ntravelers from Amboy village to the metropolis of our republic were\npermitted to refresh themselves, and the horses of the stage had a\nbreathing spell, at a certain old-fashion'd tavern, about half way\nbetween the two places. It was a quaint, comfortable, ancient house,\nthat tavern. Huge buttonwood trees embower'd it round about, and there\nwas a long porch in front, the trellis'd work whereof, though old and\nmoulder'd, had been, and promised still to be for years, held together\nby the tangled folds of a grape vine wreath'd about it like a tremendous\nserpent.\n\nHow clean and fragrant everything was there! How bright the pewter\ntankards wherefrom cider or ale went into the parch'd throat of the\nthirsty man! How pleasing to look into the expressive eyes of Kate, the\nland-lord's lovely daughter, who kept everything so clean and bright!\n\nNow the reason why Kate's eyes had become so expressive was, that,\nbesides their proper and natural office, they stood to the poor girl in\nthe place of tongue and ears also. Kate had been dumb from her birth.\nEverybody loved the helpless creature when she was a child. Gentle,\ntimid, and affectionate was she, and beautiful as the lilies of which\nshe loved to cultivate so many every summer in her garden. Her light\nhair, and the like-color'd lashes, so long and silky, that droop'd over\nher blue eyes of such uncommon size and softness--her rounded shape,\nwell set off by a little modest art of dress--her smile--the graceful\nease of her motions, always attracted the admiration of the strangers\nwho stopped there, and were quite a pride to her parents and friends.\n\nHow could it happen that so beautiful and inoffensive a being should\ntaste, even to its dregs, the bitterest unhappiness? Oh, there\nmust indeed be a mysterious, unfathomable meaning in the decrees of\nProvidence which is beyond the comprehension of man; for no one on earth\nless deserved or needed \"the uses of adversity\" than Dumb Kate. Love,\nthe mighty and lawless passion, came into the sanctuary of the maid's\npure breast, and the dove of peace fled away forever.\n\nOne of the persons who had occasion to stop most frequently at the\ntavern kept by Dumb Kate's parents was a young man, the son of a wealthy\nfarmer, who own'd an estate in the neighborhood. He saw Kate, and\nwas struck with her natural elegance. Though not of thoroughly wicked\npropensities, the fascination of so fine a prize made this youth\ndetermine to gain her love, and, if possible, to win her to himself.\nAt first he hardly dared, even amid the depths of his own soul, to\nentertain thoughts of vileness against one so confiding and childlike.\nBut in a short time such feelings wore away, and he made up his mind to\nbecome the betrayer of poor Kate. He was a good-looking fellow, and made\nbut too sure of his victim. Kate was lost!\n\nThe villain came to New York soon after, and engaged in a business which\nprosper'd well, and which has no doubt by this time made him what is\ncall'd a man of fortune.\n\nNot long did sickness of the heart wear into the life and happiness of\nDumb Kate. One pleasant spring day, the neighbors having been called by\na notice the previous morning, the old churchyard was thrown open, and\na coffin was borne over the early grass that seem'd so delicate with its\nlight green hue. There was a new made grave, and by its side the bier\nwas rested--while they paused a moment until holy words had been said.\nAn idle boy, call'd there by curiosity, saw something lying on the fresh\nearth thrown out from the grave, which attracted his attention. A little\nblossom, the only one to be seen around, had grown exactly on the spot\nwhere the sexton chose to dig poor Kate's last resting-place. It was a\nweak but lovely flower, and now lay where it had been carelessly toss'd\namid the coarse gravel. The boy twirl'd it a moment in his fingers--the\nbruis'd fragments gave out a momentary perfume, and then fell to the\nedge of the pit, over which the child at that moment lean'd and gazed in\nhis inquisitiveness. As they dropp'd, they were wafted to the bottom of\nthe grave. The last look was bestow'd on the dead girl's face by those\nwho loved her so well in life, and then she was softly laid away to her\nsleep beneath that green grass covering.\n\nYet in the churchyard on the hill is Kate's grave. There stands a little\nwhite stone at the head, and verdure grows richly there; and gossips,\nsome-times of a Sabbath afternoon, rambling over that gathering-place of\nthe gone from earth, stop a while, and con over the dumb girl's hapless\nstory.\n\n\nTALK TO AN ART-UNION\n\n_A Brooklyn fragment_\n\nIt is a beautiful truth that all men contain something of the artist in\nthem. And perhaps it is the case that the greatest artists live and die,\nthe world and themselves alike ignorant what they possess. Who would\nnot mourn that an ample palace, of surpassingly graceful architecture,\nfill'd with luxuries, and embellish'd with fine pictures and sculpture,\nshould stand cold and still and vacant, and never be known or enjoy'd\nby its owner? Would such a fact as this cause your sadness? Then be sad.\nFor there is a palace, to which the courts of the most sumptuous kings\nare but a frivolous patch, and, though it is always waiting for them,\nnot one of its owners ever enters there with any genuine sense of its\ngrandeur and glory.\n\nI think of few heroic actions, which cannot be traced to the\nartistical impulse. He who does great deeds, does them from his innate\nsensitiveness to moral beauty. Such men are not merely artists, they are\nalso artistic material. Washington in some great crisis, Lawrence on\nthe bloody deck of the Chesapeake, Mary Stuart at the block, Kossuth\nin captivity, and Mazzini in exile--all great rebels and innovators,\nexhibit the highest phases of the artist spirit. The painter, the\nsculptor, the poet, express heroic beauty better in description; but the\nothers _are_ heroic beauty, the best belov'd of art.\n\nTalk not so much, then, young artist, of the great old masters, who\nbut painted and chisell'd. Study not only their productions. There is a\nstill higher school for him who would kindle his fire with coal from\nthe altar of the loftiest and purest art. It is the school of all grand\nactions and grand virtues, of heroism, of the death of patriots and\nmartyrs--of all the mighty deeds written in the pages of history--deeds\nof daring, and enthusiasm, devotion, and fortitude.\n\n\nBLOOD-MONEY\n\n\"_Guilty of the body and the blood of Christ_.\"\n\nI.\n\n    Of olden time, when it came to pass\n    That the beautiful god, Jesus, should finish his work on earth,\n    Then went Judas, and sold the divine youth,\n    And took pay for his body.\n\n    Curs'd was the deed, even before the sweat of the clutching hand\n      grew dry;\n    And darkness frown'd upon the seller of the like of God,\n    Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from her,\n      and heaven refused him,\n    He hung in the air, self-slaughter'd.\n\n    The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalk'd silently forward,\n    Since those ancient days--many a pouch enwrapping meanwhile\n    Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.\n\n    And still goes one, saying,\n    \"What will ye give me, and I will deliver this man unto you?\"\n    And they make the covenant, and pay the pieces of silver.\n\nII\n\n    Look forth, deliverer,\n    Look forth, first-born of the dead,\n    Over the tree-tops of Paradise;\n    See thyself in yet continued bonds,\n    Toilsome and poor, thou bear'st man's form again,\n    Thou art reviled, scourged, put into prison,\n    Hunted from the arrogant equality of the rest;\n    With staves and swords throng the willing servants of authority,\n    Again they surround thee, mad with devilish spite;\n    Toward thee stretch the hands of a multitude, like vultures' talons,\n    The meanest spit in thy face, they smite thee with their palms;\n    Bruised, bloody, and pinion'd is thy body,\n    More sorrowful than death is thy soul.\n\n    Witness of anguish, brother of slaves,\n    Not with thy price closed the price of thine image:\n    And still Iscariot plies his trade.\n\n    _April, 1843_.\n\n    PAUMANOK.\n\n\nWOUNDED IN THE HOUSE OF FRIENDS\n\n_\"And one shall say unto him.

They do good--the deepest, widest, most\nneeded good--though quite certainly not in the ways attempted--which\nhave, at times, something irresistibly comic. What can be more farcical,\nfor instance, than the sight of a worthy gentleman coming three or four\nthousand miles through wet and wind to speak complacently and at\ngreat length on matters of which he both entirely mistakes or knows\nnothing--before crowds of auditors equally complacent, and equally at\nfault?\n\nYet welcome and thanks, we say, to those visitors we have, and have\nhad, from abroad among us--and may the procession continue! We have\nhad Dickens and Thackeray, Froude, Herbert Spencer, Oscar Wilde, Lord\nColeridge--soldiers, savants, poets--and now Matthew Arnold and Irving\nthe actor. Some have come to make money--some for a \"good time\"--some to\nhelp us along and give us advice--and some undoubtedly to investigate,\n_bona fide_, this great problem, democratic America, looming upon the\nworld with such cumulative power through a hundred years, now with the\nevident intention (since the secession war) to stay, and take a leading\nhand, for many a century to come, in civilization's and humanity's\neternal game. But alas! that very investigation--the method of that\ninvestigation--is where the deficit most surely and helplessly comes in.\nLet not Lord Coleridge and Mr. Arnold (to say nothing of the illustrious\nactor) imagine that when they have met and survey'd the\netiquettical gatherings of our wealthy, distinguish'd and\nsure-to-be-put-forward-on-such-occasions citizens (New York, Boston,\nPhiladelphia, &c., have certain stereotyped strings of them, continually\nlined and paraded like the lists of dishes at hotel tables--you are sure\nto get the same over and over again--it is very amusing)--and the bowing\nand introducing, the receptions at the swell clubs, the eating and\ndrinking and praising and praising back--and the next \"day riding\nabout Central Park, or doing the\" Public Institutions \"--and so passing\nthrough, one after another, the full-dress coteries of the Atlantic\ncities, all grammatical and cultured and correct, with the toned-down\nmanners of the gentlemen, and the kid-gloves, and luncheons and\nfinger-glasses--Let not our eminent visitors, we say, suppose that, by\nmeans of these experiences, they have \"seen America,\" or captur'd any\ndistinctive clew or purport thereof. Not a bit of it. Of the pulse-beats\nthat lie within and vitalize this Commonweal to-day--of the hard-pan\npurports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly by its\nbulk of men North and South, generation after generation, superficially\nunconscious of their own aims, yet none the less pressing onward\nwith deathless intuition--those coteries do not furnish the faintest\nscintilla. In the Old World the best flavor and significance of a race\nmay possibly need to be look'd for in its \"upper classes,\" its gentries,\nits court, its _etat major_. In the United States the rule is revers'd.\nBesides (and a point, this, perhaps deepest of all,) the special marks\nof our grouping and design are not going to be understood in a hurry.\nThe lesson and scanning right on the ground are difficult; I was going\nto say they are impossible to foreigners--but I have occasionally found\nthe clearest appreciation of all, coming from far-off quarters. Surely\nnothing could be more apt, not only for our eminent visitors present and\nto come, but for home study, than the following editorial criticism of\nthe London _Times_ on Mr. Froude's visits and lectures here a few years\nago, and the culminating dinner given at Delmonico's, with its brilliant\narray of guests:\n\n\"We read the list,\" says the _Times_, \"of those who assembled to do\nhonor to Mr. Froude: there were Mr. Emerson, Mr. Beecher, Mr. Curtis,\nMr. Bryant; we add the names of those who sent letters of regret that\nthey could not attend in person--Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Whittier. They are\nnames which are well known--almost as well known and as much honor'd in\nEngland as in America; and yet what must we say in the end? The American\npeople outside this assemblage of writers is something vaster and\ngreater than they, singly or together, can comprehend. It cannot be said\nof any or all of them that they can speak for their nation. We who look\non at this distance are able perhaps on that account to see the more\nclearly that there are qualities of the American people which find no\nrepresentation, no voice, among these their spokesmen. And what is true\nof them is true of the English class of whom Mr. Froude may be said to\nbe the ambassador. Mr. Froude is master of a charming style. He has the\ngift of grace and the gift of sympathy. Taking any single character as\nthe subject of his study, he may succeed after a very short time in so\ncomprehending its workings as to be able to present a living figure\nto the intelligence and memory of his readers. But the movements of a\nnation, the, _voiceless purpose of a people which cannot put its\nown thoughts into words, yet acts upon them in each successive\ngeneration_--these things do not lie within his grasp.... The functions\nof literature such as he represents are limited in their action; the\ninfluence he can wield is artificial and restricted, and, while he and\nhis hearers please and are pleas'd with pleasant periods, his great mass\nof national life will flow around them unmov'd in its tides by action as\npowerless as that of the dwellers by the shore to direct the currents of\nthe ocean.\"\n\nA thought, here, that needs to be echoed, expanded, permanently\ntreasur'd by our literary classes and educators. (The gestation, the\nyouth, the knitting preparations, are now over, and it is full time for\ndefinite purpose, result.) How few think of it, though it is the impetus\nand background of our whole Nationality and popular life. In the present\nbrief memorandum I very likely for the first time awake \"the intelligent\nreader\" to the idea and inquiry whether there isn't such a thing as the\ndistinctive genius of our democratic New World, universal, immanent,\nbringing to a head the best experience of the past--not specially\nliterary or intellectual--not merely \"good,\" (in the Sunday School and\nTemperance Society sense,)-some invisible spine and great sympathetic\nto these States, resident only in the average people, in their practical\nlife, in their physiology, in their emotions, in their nebulous yet\nfiery patriotism, in the armies (both sides) through the whole secession\nwar--an identity and character which indeed so far \"finds no voice among\ntheir spokesmen.\"\n\nTo my mind America, vast and fruitful as it appears to-day, is even yet,\nfor its most important results, entirely in the tentative state; its\nvery formation-stir and whirling trials and essays more splendid and\npicturesque, to my thinking, than the accomplish'd growths and shows\nof other lands, through European history, or Greece, or all the past.\nSurely a New World literature, worthy the name, is not to be, if it ever\ncomes, some fiction, or fancy, or bit of sentimentalism or polish'd work\nmerely by itself, or in abstraction. So long as such literature is no\nborn branch and offshoot of the Nationality, rooted and grown from its\nroots, and fibred with its fibre, it can never answer any deep call\nor perennial need. Perhaps the untaught Republic is wiser than its\nteachers. The best literature is always a result of something far\ngreater than itself--not the hero, but the portrait of the hero. Before\nthere can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction.\nBeyond the old masterpieces, the Iliad, the interminable Hindu epics,\nthe Greek tragedies, even the Bible itself, range the immense facts of\nwhat must have preceded them, their _sine qua non_--the veritable poems\nand masterpieces, of which, grand as they are, the word-statements are\nbut shreds and cartoons.\n\nFor to-day and the States, I think the vividest, rapidest, most\nstupendous processes ever known, ever perform'd by man or nation, on the\nlargest scales and in countless varieties, are now and here presented.\nNot as our poets and preachers are always conventionally putting it--but\nquite different. Some colossal foundry, the flaming of the fire, the\nmelted metal, the pounding trip-hammers, the surging crowds of workmen\nshifting from point to point, the murky shadows, the rolling haze, the\ndiscord, the crudeness, the deafening din, the disorder, the dross and\nclouds of dust, the waste and extravagance of material, the shafts of\ndarted sunshine through the vast open roof-scuttles aloft-the mighty\ncastings, many of them not yet fitted, perhaps delay'd long, yet each in\nits due time, with definite place and use and meaning--Such, more like,\nis a symbol of America.\n\nAfter all of which, returning to our starting-point, we reiterate, and\nin the whole Land's name, a welcome to our eminent guests. Visits like\ntheirs, and hospitalities, and hand-shaking, and face meeting face,\nand the distant brought near--what divine solvents they are! Travel,\nreciprocity, \"interviewing,\" intercommunion of lands--what are they\nbut Democracy's and the highest Law's best aids? O that our own\ncountry--that every land in the world--could annually, continually,\nreceive the poets, thinkers, scientists, even the official magnates, of\nother lands, as honor'd guests. O that the United States, especially the\nWest, could have had a good long visit and explorative jaunt, from\nthe noble and melancholy Tourgueneff, before he died--or from Victor\nHugo--or Thomas Carlyle. Castelar, Tennyson, any of the two or three\ngreat Parisian essayists--were they and we to come face to face, how is\nit possible but that the right understanding would ensue?\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIBLE AS POETRY\n\n\nI suppose one cannot at this day say anything new, from a literary point\nof view, about those autochthonic bequests of Asia--the Hebrew Bible,\nthe mighty Hindu epics, and a hundred lesser but typical works; (not\nnow definitely including the Iliad--though that work was certainly\nof Asiatic genesis, as Homer himself was--considerations which seem\ncuriously ignored.) But will there ever be a time or place--ever a\nstudent, however modern, of the grand art, to whom those compositions\nwill not afford profounder lessons than all else of their kind in the\ngarnerage of the past? Could there be any more opportune suggestion, to\nthe current popular writer and reader of verse, what the office of\npoet was in primeval times--and is yet capable of being, anew, adjusted\nentirely to the modern?\n\nAll the poems of Orientalism, with the Old and New Testaments at\nthe centre, tend to deep and wide, (I don't know but the deepest and\nwidest,) psychological development--with little, or nothing at all,\nof the mere esthetic, the principal verse-requirement of our day. Very\nlate, but unerringly, comes to every capable student the perception that\nit is not in beauty, it is not in art, it is not even in science,\nthat the profoundest laws of the case have their eternal sway and\noutcropping.\n\nIn his discourse on \"Hebrew Poets\" De Sola Mendes said: \"The fundamental\nfeature of Judaism, of the Hebrew nationality, was religion; its poetry\nwas naturally religious. Its subjects, God and Providence, the covenants\nwith Israel, God in Nature, and as reveal'd, God the Creator and\nGovernor, Nature in her majesty and beauty, inspired hymns and odes to\nNature's God. And then the checker'd history of the nation furnish'd\nallusions, illustrations, and subjects for epic display--the glory of\nthe sanctuary, the offerings, the splendid ritual, the Holy City, and\nlov'd Palestine with its pleasant valleys and wild tracts.\" Dr. Mendes\nsaid \"that rhyming was not a characteristic of Hebrew poetry at all.\nMetre was not a necessary mark of poetry. Great poets discarded it;\nthe early Jewish poets knew it not.\" Compared with the famed epics of\nGreece, and lesser ones since, the spinal supports of the Bible are\nsimple and meagre. All its history, biography, narratives, &c., are as\nbeads, strung on and indicating the eternal thread of the Deific purpose\nand power. Yet with only deepest faith for impetus, and such Deific\npurpose for palpable or impalpable theme, it often transcends the\nmasterpieces of Hellas, and all masterpieces.\n\nThe metaphors daring beyond account, the lawless soul, extravagant\nby our standards, the glow of love and friendship, the fervent\nkiss--nothing in argument or logic, but unsurpass'd in proverbs, in\nreligious ecstasy, in suggestions of common mortality and death, man's\ngreat equalizers--the spirit everything, the ceremonies and forms of the\nchurches nothing, faith limitless, its immense sensuousness immensely\nspiritual--an incredible, all-inclusive non-worldliness and dew-scented\nilliteracy (the antipodes of our Nineteenth Century business absorption\nand morbid refinement)--no hair-splitting doubts, no sickly sulking\nand sniffling, no \"Hamlet,\" no \"Adonais,\" no \"Thanatopsis,\" no \"In\nMemoriam.\"\n\nThe culminated proof of the poetry of a country is the quality of its\npersonnel, which, in any race, can never be really superior without\nsuperior poems. The finest blending of individuality with universality\n(in my opinion nothing out of the galaxies of the \"Iliad,\" or\nShakspere's heroes, or from the Tennysonian \"Idylls,\" so lofty, devoted\nand starlike,) typified in the songs of those old Asiatic lands. Men\nand women as great columnar trees. Nowhere else the abnegation of self\ntowering in such quaint sublimity; nowhere else the simplest human\nemotions conquering the gods of heaven, and fate itself. (The episode,\nfor instance, toward the close of the \"Mahabharata\"--the journey of the\nwife Savitri with the god of death, Yama,\n\n    \"One terrible to see--blood-red his garb,\n    His body huge and dark, bloodshot his eyes,\n    Which flamed like suns beneath his turban cloth,\n    Arm'd was he with a noose,\"\n\nwho carries off the soul of the dead husband, the wife tenaciously\nfollowing, and--by the resistless charm of perfect poetic\nrecitation!--eventually redeeming her captive mate.)\n\nI remember how enthusiastically William H. Seward, in his last days,\nonce expatiated on these themes, from his travels in Turkey, Egypt, and\nAsia Minor, finding the oldest Biblical narratives exactly illustrated\nthere to-day with apparently no break or change along three thousand\nyears--the veil'd women, the costumes, the gravity and simplicity, all\nthe manners just the same. The veteran Trelawney said he found the only\nreal _nobleman_ of the world in a good average specimen of the mid-aged\nor elderly Oriental. In the East the grand figure, always leading, is\nthe _old man_, majestic, with flowing beard, paternal, &c. In Europe and\nAmerica, it is, as we know, the young fellow--in novels, a handsome\nand interesting hero, more or less juvenile--in operas, a tenor with\nblooming cheeks, black mustache, superficial animation, and perhaps good\nlungs, but no more depth than skim-milk. But reading folks probably get\ntheir information of those Bible areas and current peoples, as depicted\nin print by English and French cads, the most shallow, impudent,\nsupercilious brood on earth.\n\nI have said nothing yet of the cumulus of associations (perfectly\nlegitimate parts of its influence, and finally in many respects the\ndominant parts,) of the Bible as a poetic entity, and of every portion\nof it. Not the old edifice only--the congeries also of events and\nstruggles and surroundings, of which it has been the scene and\nmotive--even the horrors, dreads, deaths. How many ages and generations\nhave brooded and wept and agonized over this book! What untellable joys\nand ecstasies--what support to martyrs at the stake--from it. (No really\ngreat song can ever attain full purport till long after the death of\nits singer--till it has accrued and incorporated the many passions, many\njoys and sorrows, it has itself arous'd.) To what myriads has it been\nthe shore and rock of safety--the refuge from driving tempest and wreck!\nTranslated in all languages, how it has united this diverse world! Of\ncivilized lands to-day, whose of our retrospects has it not interwoven\nand link'd and permeated? Not only does it bring us what is clasp'd\nwithin its covers; nay, that is the least of what it brings. Of its\nthousands, there is not a verse, not a word, but is thick-studded with\nhuman emotions, successions of fathers and sons, mothers and daughters,\nof our own antecedents, inseparable from that background of us,\non which, phantasmal as it is, all that we are to-day inevitably\ndepends--our ancestry, our past.\n\nStrange, but true, that the principal factor in cohering the nations,\neras and paradoxes of the globe, by giving them a common platform of\ntwo or three great ideas, a commonalty of origin, and projecting kosmic\nbrotherhood, the dream of all hope, all time--that the long trains\ngestations, attempts and failures, resulting in the New World, and in\nmodern solidarity and politics--are to be identified and resolv'd back\ninto a collection of old poetic lore, which, more than any one thing\nelse, has been the axis of civilization and history through thousands\nof years--and except for which this America of ours, with its polity and\nessentials, could not now be existing.\n\nNo true bard will ever contravene the Bible. If the time ever comes when\niconoclasm does its extremest in one direction against the Books of the\nBible in its present form, the collection must still survive in another,\nand dominate just as much as hitherto, or more than hitherto, through\nits divine and primal poetic structure. To me, that is the living and\ndefinite element-principle of the work, evolving everything else. Then\nthe continuity; the oldest and newest Asiatic utterance and character,\nand all between, holding together, like the apparition of the sky,\nand coming to us the same. Even to our Nineteenth Century here are the\nfountain heads of song.\n\n\n\n\nFATHER TAYLOR (AND ORATORY)\n\n\nI have never heard but one essentially perfect orator--one who satisfied\nthose depths of the emotional nature that in most cases go through\nlife quite untouch'd, unfed--who held every hearer by spells which no\nconventionalist, high or low--nor any pride or composure, nor resistance\nof intellect--could stand against for ten minutes.\n\nAnd by the way, is it not strange, of this first-class genius in the\nrarest and most profound of humanity's arts, that it will be necessary,\n(so nearly forgotten and rubb'd out is his name by the rushing whirl of\nthe last twenty-five years,) to first inform current readers that he was\nan orthodox minister, of no particular celebrity, who during a long life\npreach'd especially to Yankee sailors in an old fourth-class church down\nby the wharves in Boston--had practically been a seafaring man through\nhis earlier years--and died April 6, 1871, \"just as the tide turn'd,\ngoing out with the ebb as an old salt should\"? His name is now\ncomparatively unknown, outside of Boston--and even there, (though\nDickens, Mr. Jameson, Dr. Bartol and Bishop Haven have commemorated\nhim,) is mostly but a reminiscence.\n\nDuring my visits to \"the Hub,\" in 1859 and '60 I several times saw and\nheard Father Taylor. In the spring or autumn, quiet Sunday forenoons, I\nliked to go down early to the quaint ship-cabin-looking church where the\nold man minister'd--to enter and leisurely scan the building, the low\nceiling, everything strongly timber'd (polish'd and rubb'd apparently,)\nthe dark rich colors, the gallery, all in half-light--and smell the\naroma of old wood--to watch the auditors, sailors, mates, \"matlows,\"\nofficers, singly or in groups, as they came in--their physiognomies,\nforms, dress, gait, as they walk'd along the aisles--their postures,\nseating themselves in the rude, roomy, undoor'd, uncushion'd pews--and\nthe evident effect upon them of the place, occasion, and atmosphere.\n\nThe pulpit, rising ten or twelve feet high, against the rear wall, was\nback' d by a significant mural painting, in oil--showing out its bold\nlines and strong hues through the subdued light of the building--of a\nstormy sea, the waves high-rolling, and amid them an old-style ship,\nall bent over, driving through the gale, and in great peril--a vivid\nand effectual piece of limning, not meant for the criticism of artists\n(though I think it had merit even from that standpoint,) but for its\neffect upon the congregation, and what it would convey to them.\n\nFather Taylor was a moderate-sized man, indeed almost small, (reminded\nme of old Booth, the great actor, and my favorite of those and preceding\ndays,) well advanced in years, but alert, with mild blue or gray eyes,\nand good presence and voice. Soon as he open'd his mouth I ceas'd to pay\nany attention to church or audience, or pictures or lights and shades;\na far more potent charm entirely sway'd me. In the course of the sermon,\n(there was no sign of any MS., or reading from notes,) some of the parts\nwould be in the highest degree majestic and picturesque. Colloquial in a\nsevere sense, it often lean'd to Biblical and Oriental forms. Especially\nwere all allusions to ships and the ocean and sailors' lives, of\nunrival'd power and life-likeness.\n\nSometimes there were passages of fine language and composition, even\nfrom the purist's point of view. A few arguments, and of the best, but\nalways brief and simple. One realized what grip there might have been in\nsuch words-of-mouth talk as that of Socrates and Epictetus. In the main,\nI should say, of any of these discourses, that the old Demosthenean rule\nand requirement of \"action, action, action,\" first in its inward and\nthen (very moderate and restrain'd) its outward sense, was the quality\nthat had leading fulfilment.\n\nI remember I felt the deepest impression from the old man's prayers,\nwhich invariably affected me to tears. Never, on similar or any other\noccasions, have I heard such impassion'd pleading--such human-harassing\nreproach (like Hamlet to his mother, in the closet)--such probing to\nthe very depths of that latent conscience and remorse which probably lie\nsomewhere in the background of every life, every soul. For when Father\nTaylor preach'd or pray'd, the rhetoric and art, the mere words, (which\nusually play such a big part) seem'd altogether to disappear, and the\n_live feeling_ advanced upon you and seiz'd you with a power before\nunknown. Everybody felt this marvellous and awful influence. One young\nsailor, a Rhode Islander, (who came every Sunday, and I got acquainted\nwith, and talk'd to once or twice as we went away,) told me, \"that must\nbe the Holy Ghost we read of in the Testament.\"\n\nI should be at a loss to make any comparison with other preachers or\npublic speakers. When a child I had heard Elias Hicks--and Father Taylor\n(though so different in personal appearance, for Elias was of tall and\nmost shapely form, with black eyes that blazed at times like meteors,)\nalways reminded me of him. Both had the same inner, apparently\ninexhaustible, fund of latent volcanic passion--the same tenderness,\nblended with a curious remorseless firmness, as of some surgeon\noperating on a belov'd patient. Hearing such men sends to the winds all\nthe books, and formulas, and polish'd speaking, and rules of oratory.\n\nTalking of oratory, why is it that the unsophisticated practices often\nstrike deeper than the train'd ones? Why do our experiences perhaps of\nsome local country exhorter--or often in the West or South at political\nmeetings--bring the most definite results? In my time I have heard\nWebster, Clay, Edward Everett, Phillips, and such _celebres_ yet I\nrecall the minor but life-eloquence of men like John P. Hale, Cassius\nClay, and one or two of the old abolition \"fanatics\" ahead of all those\nstereotyped fames. Is not--I sometimes question--the first, last, and\nmost important quality of all, in training for a \"finish'd speaker,\"\ngenerally unsought, unreck'd of, both by teacher and pupil? Though\nmay-be it cannot be taught, anyhow. At any rate, we need to clearly\nunderstand the distinction between oratory and elocution. Under the\nlatter art, including some of high order, there is indeed no scarcity in\nthe United States, preachers, lawyers, actors, lecturers, &c. With all,\nthere seem to be few real orators--almost none.\n\nI repeat, and would dwell upon it (more as suggestion than mere\nfact)--among all the brilliant lights of bar or stage I have heard in\nmy time (for years in New York and other cities I haunted the courts\nto witness notable trials, and have heard all the famous actors and\nactresses that have been in America the past fifty years) though\nI recall marvellous effects from one or other of them, I never had\nanything in the way of vocal utterance to shake me through and through,\nand become fix'd, with its accompaniments, in my memory, like those\nprayers and sermons--like Father Taylor's personal electricity and the\nwhole scene there--the prone ship in the gale, and dashing wave and foam\nfor background--in the little old sea-church in Boston, those summer\nSundays just before the secession war broke out.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPANISH ELEMENT IN OUR NATIONALITY\n\n\n\n[Our friends at Santa Fe, New Mexico, have just finish'd their\nlong-drawn-out anniversary of the 333d year of the settlement of their\ncity by the Spanish. The good, gray Walt Whitman was asked to write\nthem a poem in commemoration. Instead he wrote them a letter as\nfollows:--_Philadelphia Press_, August 5, 1883.]\n\nCAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _July 20, 1883_.\n\n_To Messrs. Griffin, Martinez, Prince, and other Gentlemen at Santa Fe_:\n\nDEAR SIRS:--Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the\n333d Anniversary of founding Santa Fe has reach'd me so late that I have\nto decline, with sincere regret. But I will say a few words offhand.\n\nWe Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort\nthem, to unify them. They will be found ampler than has been supposed,\nand in widely different sources. Thus far, impress'd by New England\nwriters and schoolmasters, we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion\nthat our United States have been fashion'd from the British Islands\nonly, and essentially form a second England only--which is a very great\nmistake. Many leading traits for our future national personality, and\nsome of the best ones, will certainly prove to have originated from\nother than British stock. As it is, the British and German, valuable as\nthey are in the concrete, already threaten excess. Or rather, I should\nsay, they have certainly reach'd that excess. To-day, something outside\nof them, and to counterbalance them, is seriously needed.\n\nThe seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States,\nin their present devouring relations, controlling and belittling\neverything else, are, in my opinion, but a vast and indispensable stage\nin the new world's development, and are certainly to be follow'd\nby something entirely different--at least by immense modifications.\nCharacter, literature, a society worthy the name, are yet to be\nestablish'd, through a nationality of noblest spiritual, heroic\nand democratic attributes--not one of which at present definitely\nexists--entirely different from the past, though unerringly founded on\nit, and to justify it.\n\nTo that composite American identity of the future, Spanish character\nwill supply some of the most needed parts. No stock shows a grander\nhistoric retrospect--grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for\npatriotism, courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss\nutterly the illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and half\nMysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the past 200\nyears. It is time to realize--for it is certainly true--that there\nwill not be found any more cruelty, tyranny, superstition, &c., in the\n_resume_ of past Spanish history than in the corresponding _resume_ of\nAnglo-Norman history. Nay, I think there will not be found so much.)\n\nThen another point, relating to American ethnology, past and to come,\nI will here touch upon at a venture. As to our aboriginal or Indian\npopulation--the Aztec in the South, and many a tribe in the North and\nWest--I know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as\ntime rolls on, and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence,\na blank. But I am not at all clear about that. As America, from its\nmany far-back sources and current supplies, develops, adapts, entwines,\nfaithfully identifies its own--are we to see it cheerfully accepting\nand using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside\nglobe--and then rejecting the only ones distinctively its own--the\nautochthonic ones?\n\nAs to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we\ndo not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its\nrace element. Who knows but that element, like the course of some\nsubterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years, is now\nto emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?\n\nIf I might assume to do so, I would like to send you the most cordial,\nheartfelt congratulations of your American fellow-countrymen here. You\nhave more friends in the Northern and Atlantic regions than you\nsuppose, and they are deeply interested in the development of the great\nSouthwestern interior, and in what your festival would arouse to public\nattention.\n\nVery respectfully, &c.,\n\nWALT WHITMAN.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT LURKS BEHIND SHAKSPERE'S HISTORICAL PLAYS\n\n\nWe all know how much _mythus_ there is in the Shakspere question as it\nstands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are\ncertainly engulf d far more dim and elusive ones, of deepest\nimportance--tantalizing and half suspected--suggesting explanations that\none dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point,\nthe English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as\ndramatic performances (my maturest judgment confirming the impressions\nof my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside\nnot in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the\ncontests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we\nget it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of\nthe fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism--personifying in\nunparallel'd ways the mediaeval aristocracy, its towering spirit of\nruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance\n(no mere imitation)--only one of the \"wolfish earls\" so plenteous in the\nplays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be\nthe true author of those amazing works--works in some respects greater\nthan anything else in recorded literature.\n\nThe start and germ-stock of the pieces on which the present speculation\nis founded are undoubtedly (with, at the outset, no small amount of\nbungling work) in \"Henry VI.\" It is plain to me that as profound and\nforecasting a brain and pen as ever appear'd in literature, after\nfloundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogy--or perhaps\ndraughting it more or less experimentally or by accident--afterward\ndeveloped and defined his plan in the Second and Third Parts, and from\ntime to time, thenceforward, systematically enlarged it to majestic and\nmature proportions in \"Richard II,\" \"Richard III,\" \"King John,\" \"Henry\nIV,\" \"Henry V,\" and even in \"Macbeth,\" \"Coriolanus\" and \"Lear.\" For it\nis impossible to grasp the whole cluster of those plays, however wide\nthe intervals and different circumstances of their composition, without\nthinking of them as, in a free sense, the result of an _essentially\ncontroling plan_. 'What was that plan? Or, rather, what was veil'd\nbehind it?--for to me there was certainly something so veil'd. Even the\nepisodes of Cade, Joan of Arc, and the like (which sometimes seem to me\nlike interpolations allow'd,) may be meant to foil the possible sleuth,\nand throw any too 'cute pursuer off the scent. In the whole matter I\nshould specially dwell on, and make much of, that inexplicable element\nof every highest poetic nature which causes it to cover up and involve\nits real purpose and meanings in folded removes and far recesses. Of\nthis trait--hiding the nest where common seekers may never find it--the\nShaksperean works afford the most numerous and mark'd illustrations\nknown to me. I would even call that trait the leading one through the\nwhole of those works.\n\nAll the foregoing to premise a brief statement of how and where I get my\nnew light on Shakspere. Speaking of the special English plays, my friend\nWilliam O'Connor says:\n\n  They seem simply and rudely historical in their motive, as aiming\n  to give in the rough a tableau of warring dynasties,--and carry to\n  me a lurking sense of being in aid of some ulterior design, probably\n  well enough understood in that age, which perhaps time and criticism\n  will reveal.... Their atmosphere is one of barbarous and tumultuous\n  gloom,--they do not make us love the times they limn,... and it is\n  impossible to believe that the greatest of the Elizabethan men could\n  have sought to indoctrinate the age with the love of feudalism which\n  his own drama in its entirety, if the view taken of it herein be true,\n  certainly and subtly saps and mines.\n\nReading the just-specified play in the light of Mr. O'Connor's\nsuggestion, I defy any one to escape such new and deep\nutterance-meanings, like magic ink, warm' d by the fire, and previously\ninvisible. Will it not indeed be strange if the author of \"Othello\" and\n\"Hamlet\" is destin'd to live in America, in a generation or two, less as\nthe cunning draughtsman of the passions, and more as putting on record\nthe first full expose--and by far the most vivid one, immeasurably ahead\nof doctrinaires and economists--of the political theory and results, or\nthe reason-why and necessity for them which America has come on earth to\nabnegate and replace?\n\nThe summary of my suggestion would be, therefore, that while the more\nthe rich and tangled jungle of the Shaksperean area is travers'd and\nstudied, and the more baffled and mix'd, as so far appears, becomes the\nexploring student (who at last surmises everything, and remains certain\nof nothing,) it is possible a future age of criticism, diving deeper,\nmapping the land and lines freer, completer than hitherto, may discover\nin the plays named the scientific (Baconian?) inauguration of modern\ndemocracy--furnishing realistic and first-class artistic portraitures\nof the mediaeval world, the feudal personalities, institutes, in their\nmorbid accumulations, deposits, upon politics and sociology,--may\npenetrate to that hard-pan, far down and back of the ostent of to-day,\non which (and on which only) the progressism of the last two centuries\nhas built this Democracy which now hold's secure lodgment over the whole\ncivilized world.\n\nWhether such was the unconscious, or (as I think likely) the more\nor less conscious, purpose of him who fashion'd those marvellous\narchitectonics, is a secondary question.\n\n\n\n\nA THOUGHT ON SHAKSPERE\n\n\nThe most distinctive poems--the most permanently rooted and with\nheartiest reason for being--the copious cycle of Arthurian legends, or\nthe almost equally copious Charlemagne cycle, or the poems of the Cid,\nor Scandinavian Eddas, or Nibelungen, or Chaucer, or Spenser, or _bona\nfide_ Ossian, or Inferno--probably had their rise in the great historic\nperturbations, which they came in to sum up and confirm, indirectly\nembodying results to date. Then however precious to \"culture,\" the\ngrandest of those poems, it may be said, preserve and typify results\noffensive to the modern spirit, and long past away. To state it briefly,\nand taking the strongest examples, in Homer lives the ruthless military\nprowess of Greece, and of its special god-descended dynastic houses;\nin Shakspere the dragon-rancors and stormy feudal Splendor of mediaeval\ncaste.\n\nPoetry, largely consider'd, is an evolution, sending out improved\nand-ever-expanded types--in one sense, the past, even the best of it,\nnecessarily giving place, and dying out. For our existing world,\nthe bases on which all the grand old poems were built have become\nvacuums--and even those of many comparatively modern ones are broken and\nhalf-gone. For us to-day, not their own intrinsic value, vast as that\nis, backs and maintains those poems--but a mountain-high growth of\nassociations, the layers of successive ages. Everywhere--their own lands\nincluded--(is there not something terrible in the tenacity with which\nthe one book out of millions holds its grip?)--the Homeric and Virgilian\nworks, the interminable ballad-romances of the middle ages, the\nutterances of Dante, Spenser, and others, are upheld by their\ncumulus-entrenchment in scholarship, and as precious, always welcome,\nunspeakably valuable reminiscences.\n\nEven the one who at present reigns unquestion'd--of Shakspere--for all\nhe stands for so much in modern literature, he stands entirely for\nthe mighty esthetic sceptres of the past, not for the spiritual\nand democratic, the sceptres of the future. The inward and outward\ncharacteristics of Shakspere are his vast and rich variety of persons\nand themes, with his wondrous delineation of each and all,--not only\nlimitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource, but great excess,\nsuperfoetation--mannerism, like a fine, aristocratic perfume, holding\na touch of musk (Euphues, his mark)--with boundless sumptuousness and\nadornment, real velvet and gems, not shoddy nor paste--but a good deal\nof bombast and fustian--(certainly some terrific mouthing in Shakspere!)\n\nSuperb and inimitable as all is, it is mostly an objective and\nphysiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in Shakspere--a\nstyle supremely grand of the sort, but in my opinion stopping short of\nthe grandest sort, at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern and\nscientific and democratic American purposes. Think, not of growths as\nforests primeval, or Yellowstone geysers, or Colorado ravines, but of\ncostly marble palaces, and palace rooms, and the noblest fixings and\nfurniture, and noble owners and occupants to correspond--think of\ncarefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening\nart at its best, with walks and bowers and artificial lakes, and\nappropriate statue-groups and the finest cultivated roses and lilies\nand japonicas in plenty--and you have the tally of Shakspere. The\nlow characters, mechanics, even the loyal henchmen--all in themselves\nnothing--serve as capital foils to the aristocracy. The comedies\n(exquisite as they certainly are) bringing in admirably portray'd common\ncharacters, have the unmistakable hue of plays, portraits, made for the\ndivertisement only of the elite of the castle, and from its point\nof view. The comedies are altogether non-acceptable to America and\nDemocracy.\n\nBut to the deepest soul, it seems a shame to pick and choose from\nthe riches Shakspere has left us--to criticise his infinitely royal,\nmultiform quality--to gauge, with optic glasses, the dazzle of his\nsun-like beams.\n\nThe best poetic utterance, after all, can merely hint, or remind, often\nvery indirectly, or at distant removes. Aught of real perfection, or the\nsolution of any deep problem, or any completed statement of the moral,\nthe true, the beautiful, eludes the greatest, deftest poet--flies away\nlike an always uncaught bird.\n\n\n\n\nROBERT BURNS AS POET AND PERSON\n\n\nWhat the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works--what place\nwill be assign'd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which\ncan only be finish'd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries\nwith their ample average--I of course cannot tell. But as we know him,\nfrom his recorded utterances, and after nearly one century, and its\ndiligence of collections, songs, letters, anecdotes, presenting the\nfigure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully\ncomplete, and the lines mainly by his own hand, he forms to-day, in some\nrespects, the most interesting personality among singers. Then there are\nmany things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to\nAmerica. He was essentially a Republican--would have been at home in\nthe Western United States, and probably become eminent there. He was\nan average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud-spirited,\namative, alimentive, convivial, young and early-middle-aged man of the\ndecent-born middle classes everywhere and any how. Without the race of\nwhich he is a distinct specimen, (and perhaps his poems) America and\nher powerful Democracy could not exist to-day--could not project with\nunparallel'd historic sway into the future.\n\nPerhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first\nto be consider'd. It included the times of the '76-'83 Revolution in\nAmerica, of the French Revolution, and an unparallel'd chaos development\nin Europe and elsewhere. In every department, shining and strange names,\nlike stars, some rising, some in meridian, some declining--Voltaire,\nFranklin, Washington, Kant, Goethe, Fulton, Napoleon, mark the era.\nAnd while so much, and of grandest moment, fit for the trumpet of the\nworld's fame, was being transacted--that little tragi-comedy of R. B,'s\nlife and death was going on in a country by-place in Scotland!\n\nBurns's correspondence, generally collected and publish'd since his\ndeath, gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak (and worse\nthan weak) parts of his portraiture, habits, good and bad luck, ambition\nand associations. His letters to Mrs. Dunlop, Mrs. McLehose, (Clarinda,)\nMr. Thompson, Dr. Moore, Robert Muir, Mr. Cunningham, Miss Margaret\nChalmers, Peter Hill, Richard Brown, Mrs. Riddel, Robert Ainslie, and\nRobert Graham, afford valuable lights and shades to the outline, and\nwith numerous others, help to a touch here, and fill-in there, of\npoet and poems. There are suspicions, it is true, of \"the Genteel\nLetter-Writer,\" with scraps and words from \"the Manual of French\nQuotations,\" and, in the love-letters, some hollow mouthings. Yet we\nwouldn't on any account lack the letters. A full and true portrait is\nalways what is wanted; veracity at every hazard. Besides, do we not\nall see by this time that the story of Burns, even for its own sake,\nrequires the record of the whole and several, with nothing left out?\nCompletely and every point minutely told out its fullest, explains and\njustifies itself--(as perhaps almost any life does.) He is very close\nto the earth. He pick'd up his best words and tunes directly from the\nScotch home-singers, but tells Thompson they would not please his, T.'s,\n\"learn'd lugs,\" adding, \"I call them simple--you would pronounce them\nsilly.\" Yes, indeed; the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit. Yet\nDr. Moore, in 1789, writes to Burns, \"If I were to offer an opinion, it\nwould be that in your future productions you should abandon the Scotch\nstanza and dialect, and adopt the measure and language of modern English\npoetry\"!\n\nAs the 128th birth-anniversary of the poet draws on, (January, 1887,)\nwith its increasing club-suppers, vehement celebrations, letters,\nspeeches, and so on--(mostly, as William O'Connor says, from people who\nwould not have noticed R. B. at all during his actual life, nor kept\nhis company, or read his verses, on any account)--it may be opportune\nto print some leisurely-jotted notes I find in my budget. I take my\nobservation of the Scottish bard by considering him as an individual\namid the crowded clusters, galaxies, of the old world--and fairly\ninquiring and suggesting what out of these myriads he too may be to\nthe Western Republic. In the first place no poet on record so fully\nbequeaths his own personal magnetism,[39] nor illustrates more pointedly\nhow one's verses, by time and reading, can so curiously fuse with the\nversifier's own life and death, and give final light and shade to all.\n\nI would say a large part of the fascination of Burns's homely, simple\ndialect-melodies is due, for all current and future readers, to\nthe poet's personal \"errors,\" the general bleakness of his lot, his\ningrain'd pensiveness, his brief dash into dazzling, tantalizing,\nevanescent sunshine--finally culminating in those last years of\nhis life, his being taboo'd and in debt, sick and sore, yaw'd as by\ncontending gales, deeply dissatisfied with everything, most of all with\nhimself--high-spirited too--(no man ever really higher-spirited than\nRobert Burns.) I think it a perfectly legitimate part too. At any rate\nit has come to be an impalpable aroma through which only both the songs\nand their singer must henceforth be read and absorb'd. Through that\nview-medium of misfortune--of a noble spirit in low environments, and of\na squalid and premature death--we view the undoubted facts, (giving, as\nwe read them now, a sad kind of pungency,) that Burns's were, before all\nelse, the lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication. Perhaps\neven it is this strange, impalpable _post-mortem_ comment and influence\nreferr'd to, that gives them their contrast, attraction, making the\nzest of their author's after fame. If he had lived steady, fat, moral,\ncomfortable, well-to-do years, on his own grade, (let alone, what of\ncourse was out of the question, the ease and velvet and rosewood and\ncopious royalties of Tennyson or Victor Hugo or Longfellow,) and died\nwell-ripen'd and respectable, where could have come in that burst\nof passionate sobbing and remorse which well'd forth instantly\nand generally in Scotland, and soon follow'd everywhere among\nEnglish-speaking races, on the announcement of his death? and which,\nwith no sign of stopping, only regulated and vein'd with fitting\nappreciation, flows deeply, widely yet?\n\nDear Rob! manly, witty, fond, friendly, full of weak spots as well as\nstrong ones-essential type of so many thousands--perhaps the average, as\njust said, of the decent-born young men and the early mid-aged, not only\nof the British Isles, but America, too, North and South, just the same.\nI think, indeed, one best part of Burns is the unquestionable proof\nhe presents of the perennial existence among the laboring classes,\nespecially farmers, of the finest latent poetic elements in their blood.\n(How clear it is to me that the common soil has always been, and is now,\nthickly strewn with just such gems.) He is well-called the _Ploughman_.\n\"Holding the plough,\" said his brother Gilbert, \"was the favorite\nsituation with Robert for poetic compositions; and some of his best\nverses were produced while he was at that exercise.\" \"I must return\nto my humble station, and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way, at the\nplough-tail.\" 1787, to the Earl of Buchan. He has no high ideal of the\npoet or the poet's office; indeed quite a low and contracted notion of\nboth:\n\n    \"Fortune! if thou'll but gie me still\n    Hale breeks, a scone, and whiskey gill,\n    An' rowth o' rhyme to rave at will,\n    Tak' a' the rest.\"\n\nSee also his rhym'd letters to Robert Graham invoking patronage; \"one\nstronghold,\" Lord Glencairn, being dead, now these appeals to \"Fintra,\nmy other stay,\" (with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation\ngenerally.) In his collected poems there is no particular unity, nothing\nthat can be called a leading theory, no unmistakable spine or skeleton.\nPerhaps, indeed, their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs: \"I\ntake up one or another,\" he says in a letter to Thompson, \"just as the\nbee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug.\"\n\nConsonantly with the customs of the time--yet markedly inconsistent in\nspirit with Burns's own case, (and not a little painful as it remains\non record, as depicting some features of the bard himself,) the relation\ncalled _patronage_ existed between the nobility and gentry on one\nside, and literary people on the other, and gives one of the strongest\nside-lights to the general coloring of poems and poets. It crops out a\ngood deal in Burns's Letters, and even necessitated a certain flunkeyism\non occasions, through life. It probably, with its requirements, (while\nit help'd in money and countenance) did as much as any one cause in\nmaking that life a chafed and unhappy one, ended by a premature and\nmiserable death.\n\nYes, there is something about Burns peculiarly acceptable to the\nconcrete, human points of view. He poetizes work-a-day agricultural\nlabor and life, (whose spirit and sympathies, as well as practicalities,\nare much the same everywhere,) and treats fresh, often coarse, natural\noccurrences, loves, persons, not like many new and some old poets in a\ngenteel style of gilt and china, or at second or third removes, but in\ntheir own born atmosphere, laughter, sweat, unction. Perhaps no one ever\nsang \"lads and lasses\"--that universal race, mainly the same, too, all\nages, all lands--down on their own plane, as he has. He exhibits\nno philosophy worth mentioning; his morality is hardly more than\nparrot-talk--not bad or deficient, but cheap, shopworn, the platitudes\nof old aunts and uncles to the youngsters (be good boys and keep your\nnoses clean.) Only when he gets at Poosie Nansie's, celebrating the\n\"barley bree,\" or among tramps, or democratic bouts and drinking\ngenerally,\n\n    (\"Freedom and whiskey gang the gither.\")\n\nwe have, in his own unmistakable color and warmth, those interiors\nof rake-helly life and tavern fun--the cantabile of jolly beggars in\nhighest jinks--lights and groupings of rank glee and brawny amorousness,\noutvying the best painted pictures of the Dutch school, or any school.\n\nBy America and her democracy such a poet, I cannot too often repeat,\nmust be kept in loving remembrance; but it is best that discriminations\nbe made. His admirers (as at those anniversary suppers, over the \"hot\nScotch\") will not accept for their favorite anything less than the\nhighest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakspere, etc. Such, in candor, are\nnot the true friends of the Ayrshire bard, who really needs a different\nplace quite by himself. The Iliad and the Odyssey express courage,\ncraft, full-grown heroism in situations of danger, the sense of command\nand leadership, emulation, the last and fullest evolution of self-poise\nas in kings, and god-like even while animal appetites. The Shaksperean\ncompositions, on vertebers and frame-work of the primary passions,\nportray (essentially the same as Homer's,) the spirit and letter of the\nfeudal world, the Norman lord, ambitious and arrogant, taller and\nnobler than common men--with much underplay and gusts of heat and cold,\nvolcanoes and stormy seas. Burns (and some will say to his credit)\nattempts none of these themes. He poetizes the humor, riotous blood,\nsulks, amorous torments, fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective\nnature, with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his\ntime and land, of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in Scotland,\nthrough the years and under the circumstances of the British politics\nof that time, and of his short personal career as author, from 1783 to\n1796. He is intuitive and affectionate, and just emerged or emerging\nfrom the shackles of the kirk, from poverty, ignorance, and from his\nown rank appetites--(out of which latter, however, he never extricated\nhimself.) It is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his\npoems, there is in almost every piece a spark of fire, and now and then\nthe real afflatus. He has been applauded as democratic, and with some\nwarrant; while Shakspere, and with the greatest warrant, has been called\nmonarchical or aristocratic (which he certainly is.) But the splendid\npersonalizations of Shakspere, formulated on the largest, freest, most\nheroic, most artistic mould, are to me far dearer as lessons, and more\nprecious even as models for Democracy, than the humdrum samples\nBurns presents. The motives of some of his effusions are certainly\ndiscreditable personally--one or two of them markedly so. He has,\nmoreover, little or no spirituality. This last is his mortal flaw and\ndefect, tried by highest standards. The ideal he never reach'd (and yet\nI think he leads the way to it.) He gives melodies, and now and then the\nsimplest and sweetest ones; but harmonies, complications, oratorios in\nwords, never. (I do not speak this in any deprecatory sense. Blessed be\nthe memory of the warm-hearted Scotchman for what he has left us, just\nas it is!) He likewise did not know himself, in more ways than one.\nThough so really fret and independent, he prided himself in his songs on\nbeing a reactionist and a Jacobite--on persistent sentimental adherency\nto the cause of the Stuarts--the weakest, thinnest, most faithless,\nbrainless dynasty that ever held a throne.\n\nThus, while Burns is not at all great for New World study, in the\nsense that Isaiah and Eschylus and the book of Job are unquestionably\ngreat--is not to be mention'd with Shakspere--hardly even with current\nTennyson or our Emerson--he has a nestling niche of his own, all\nfragrant, fond, and quaint and homely--a lodge built near but outside\nthe mighty temple of the gods of song and art--those universal strivers,\nthrough their works of harmony and melody and power, to ever show or\nintimate man's crowning, last, victorious fusion in himself of Real\nand Ideal. Precious, too--fit and precious beyond all singers, high\nor low--will Burns ever be to the native Scotch, especially to the\nworking-classes of North Britain; so intensely one of them, and so racy\nof the soil, sights, and local customs. He often apostrophizes Scotland,\nand is, or would be, enthusiastically patriotic. His country has lately\ncommemorated him in a statue.[40] His aim is declaredly to be 'a Rustic\nBard.' His poems were all written in youth or young manhood, (he was\nlittle more than a young man when he died.) His collected works in\ngiving everything, are nearly one half first drafts. His brightest hit\nis his use of the Scotch patois, so full of terms flavor'd like wild\nfruits or berries. Then I should make an allowance to Burns which cannot\nbe made for any other poet. Curiously even the frequent crudeness,\nhaste, deficiencies, (flatness and puerilities by no means absent) prove\nupon the whole not out of keeping in any comprehensive collection of\nhis works, heroically printed, \"following copy,\" every piece, every line\naccording to originals. Other poets might tremble for such boldness,\nsuch rawness. In \"this odd-kind chiel\" such points hardly mar the\nrest. Not only are they in consonance with the underlying spirit of the\npieces, but complete the full abandon and veracity of the farm-fields\nand the home-brew'd flavor of the Scotch vernacular. (Is there not\noften something in the very neglect, unfinish, careless nudity, slovenly\nhiatus, coming from intrinsic genius, and not \"put on,\" that secretly\npleases the soul more than the wrought and re-wrought polish of the most\nperfect verse?) Mark the native spice and untranslatable twang in the\nvery names of his songs-\"O for ane and twenty, Tam,\" \"John Barleycorn,\"\n\"Last May a braw Wooer,\" \"Rattlin roarin Willie,\" \"O wert thou in the\ncauld, cauld blast,\" \"Gude e'en to you, Kimmer,\" \"Merry hae I been\nteething a Heckle,\" \"O lay thy loof in mine, lass,\" and others.\n\nThe longer and more elaborated poems of Burns are just such as would\nplease a natural but homely taste, and cute but average intellect, and\nare inimitable in their way. The \"Twa Dogs,\" (one of the best) with the\nconversation between Cesar and Luath, the \"Brigs of Ayr,\" \"the Cotter's\nSaturday Night,\" \"Tam O'Shanter\"--all will be long read and re-read and\nadmired, and ever deserve to be. With nothing profound in any of them,\nwhat there is of moral and plot has an inimitably fresh and racy flavor.\nIf it came to question, Literature could well afford to send adrift many\na pretensive poem, and even book of poems, before it could spare these\ncompositions.\n\nNever indeed was there truer utterance in a certain range of\nidiosyncrasy than by this poet. Hardly a piece of his, large or small,\nbut has \"snap\" and raciness. He puts in cantering rhyme (often\ndoggerel) much cutting irony and idiomatic ear-cuffing of the\nkirk-deacons--drilygood-natured addresses to his cronies, (he certainly\nwould not stop us if he were here this moment, from classing that\n\"to the De'il\" among them)--\"to Mailie and her Lambs,\" \"to auld Mare\nMaggie,\" \"to a Mouse,\"\n\n    \"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie:\"\n\n\"to a Mountain Daisy,\" \"to a Haggis,\" \"to a Louse,\" \"to the Toothache,\"\n&c.--and occasionally to his brother bards and lady or gentleman\npatrons, often with strokes of tenderest sensibility, idiopathic humor,\nand genuine poetic imagination--still oftener with shrewd, original,\nsheeny, steel-flashes of wit, home-spun sense, or lance-blade\npuncturing. Then, strangely, the basis of Burns's character, with all\nits fun and manliness, was hypochondria, the blues, palpable enough in\n\"Despondency,\" \"Man was made to Mourn,\" \"Address to Ruin,\" a \"Bard's\nEpitaph,\" &c. From such deep-down elements sprout up, in very contrast\nand paradox, those riant utterances of which a superficial reading will\nnot detect the hidden foundation. Yet nothing is clearer to me than\nthe black and desperate background behind those pieces--as I shall now\nspecify them. I find his most characteristic, Nature's masterly touch\nand luxuriant life-blood, color and heat, not in \"Tam O'Shanter,\" \"the\nCotter's Saturday Night,\" \"Scots wha hae,\" \"Highland Mary,\" \"the Twa\nDogs,\" and the like, but in \"the Jolly Beggars,\" \"Rigs of Barley,\"\n\"Scotch Drink,\" \"the Epistle to John Rankine,\" \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\"\nand in \"Halloween,\" (to say nothing of a certain cluster, known still to\na small inner circle in Scotland, but, for good reasons, not published\nanywhere.) In these compositions, especially the first, there is much\nindelicacy (some editions flatly leave it out,) but the composer reigns\nalone, with handling free and broad and true, and is an artist. You may\nsee and feel the man indirectly in his other verses, all of them,\nwith more or less life-likeness--but these I have named last call out\npronouncedly in his own voice,\n\n    \"I, Rob, am here.\"\n\nFinally, in any summing-up of Burns, though so much is to be said in the\nway of fault-finding, drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary\ncriticism--(in the present outpouring I have \"kept myself in,\" rather\nthan allow'd any free flow)--after full retrospect of his works and\nlife, the aforesaid \"odd-kind chiel\" remains to my heart and brain as\nalmost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory) dearest\nflesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone poets.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n[39] Probably no man that ever lived--a friend has made the\nstatement--was so fondly loved, both by men and women, as Robert Burns.\nThe reason is not hard to find: he had a real heart of flesh and blood\nbeating in his bosom; you could almost hear it throb. \"Some one said,\nthat if you had shaken hands with him his hand would have burnt yours.\nThe gods, indeed, made him poetical, but Nature had a hand in him first.\nHis heart was in the right place; he did not pile up cantos of poetic\ndiction; he pluck'd the mountain daisy under his feet; he wrote of\nfield-mouse hurrying from its ruin'd dwelling. He held the plough or the\npen with the same firm, manly grasp. And he was loved. The simple roll\nof the women who gave him their affection and their sympathy would make\na long manuscript; and most of these were of such noble worth that, as\nRobert Chambers says, 'their character may stand as a testimony in favor\nof that of Burns.'\" [As I understand, the foregoing is from an extremely\nrare book publish'd by M'Kie, in Kilmarnock. I find the whole beautiful\nparagraph in a capital paper on Burns, by Amelia Barr.]\n\n[40] The Dumfries statue of Robert Burns was successfully unveil'd April\n1881 by Lord Rosebery, the occasion having been made national in its\ncharacter. Before the ceremony, a large procession paraded the streets\nof the town, all the trades and societies of that part of Scotland\nbeing represented, at the head of which went dairymen and ploughmen,\nthe former driving their carts and being accompanied by their maids. The\nstatue is of Sicilian marble. It rests on a pedestal of gray stone five\nfeet high. The poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree\nroot, holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies. His face is turn'd\ntoward the right shoulder, and the eyes gaze into the distance. Near by\nlie a collie dog, a broad bonnet half covering a well-thumb'd song-book,\nand a rustic flageolet. The costume is taken from the Nasmyth portrait,\nwhich has been follow'd for the features of the face.\n\n\n\n\nA WORD ABOUT TENNYSON\n\n\nBeautiful as the song was, the original \"Locksley Hall\" of half a\ncentury ago was essentially morbid, heart-broken, finding fault with\neverything, especially the fact of money's being made (as it ever must\nbe, and perhaps should be) the paramount matter in worldly affairs;\n\n    Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.\n\nFirst, a father, having fallen in battle, his child (the singer)\n\n    Was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.\n\nOf course love ensues. The woman in the chant or monologue proves a\nfalse one; and as far as appears the ideal of woman, in the poet's\nreflections, is a false one--at any rate for America. Woman is _not_\n\"the lesser man.\" (The heart is not the brain.) The best of the piece of\nfifty years since is its concluding line:\n\n    For the mighty wind arises roaring seaward and I go.\n\nThen for this current 1886-7, a just-out sequel, which (as an apparently\nauthentic summary says) \"reviews the life of mankind during the past\nsixty years, and comes to the conclusion that its boasted progress is of\ndoubtful credit to the world in general and to England in particular. A\ncynical vein of denunciation of democratic opinions and aspirations runs\nthroughout the poem in mark'd contrast with the spirit of the poet's\nyouth.\" Among the most striking lines of this sequel are the following:\n\n    Envy wears the mask of love, and, laughing sober fact to scorn,\n    Cries to weakest as to strongest, 'Ye are equals, equal born,'\n    Equal-born! Oh yes, if yonder hill be level with the flat.\n    Charm us, orator, till the lion look no larger than the cat:\n    Till the cat, through that mirage of overheated language, loom\n    Larger than the lion Demo--end in working its own doom.\n    Tumble Nature heel o'er head, and, yelling with the yelling street,\n    Set the feet above the brain, and swear the brain is in the feet,\n    Bring the old dark ages back, without the faith, without the hope.\n    Beneath the State, the Church, the Throne, and roll their ruins down\n      the slope.\n\nI should say that all this is a legitimate consequence of the tone\nand convictions of the earlier standards and points of view. Then some\nreflections, down to the hard-pan of this sort of thing.\n\nThe course of progressive politics (democracy) is so certain and\nresistless, not only in America but in Europe, that we can well afford\nthe warning calls, threats, checks, neutralizings, in imaginative\nliterature, or any department, of such deep-sounding, and high-soaring\nvoices as Carlyle's and Tennyson's. Nay, the blindness, excesses, of the\nprevalent tendency--the dangers of the urgent trends of our times--in my\nopinion, need such voices almost more than any. I should, too, call it\na signal instance of democratic humanity's luck that it has such enemies\nto contend with--so candid, so fervid, so heroic. But why do I say\nenemies? Upon the whole is not Tennyson--and was not Carlyle (like an\nhonest and stern physician)--the true friend of our age?\n\nLet me assume to pass verdict, or perhaps momentary judgment, for the\nUnited States on this poet--a remov'd and distant position giving some\nadvantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race,\ntimes, and especially to America? First, I should say--or at least not\nforget--his personal character. He is not to be mention'das a rugged,\nevolutionary, aboriginal force--but (and a great lesson is in it) he has\nbeen consistent throughout with the native, healthy, patriotic\nspinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and\nconventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the uppercrust of\nhis time, its pale cast of thought--even its _ennui_. Then the simile\nof my friend John Burroughs is entirely true, \"his glove is a glove of\nsilk, but the hand is a hand of iron.\" He shows how one can be a royal\nlaureate, quite elegant and \"aristocratic,\" and a little queer and\naffected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his\nnon-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I\nguess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those\nsides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own--different\nand yet with a sort of home-likeness--a tartness and contradiction\noffsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and\nproclivities not at all his own.\n\nTo me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a\nwarning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism. There is such\na latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and in the voice\nringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all others--as\nin the line,\n\n    And hollow, hollow, hollow, all delight,\n\nin \"The Passing of Arthur,\" and evidenced in \"The Lady of Shalott,\" \"The\nDeserted House,\" and many other pieces. Among the best (I often linger\nover them again and again) are \"Lucretius,\" \"The Lotos Eaters,\" and \"The\nNorthern Farmer.\" His mannerism is great, but it is a noble and welcome\nmannerism. His very best work, to me, is contain'd in the books of \"The\nIdylls of the King,\" and all that has grown out of them. Though\nindeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson, however small or however\npeculiar--not \"Break, Break,\" nor \"Flower in the Crannied Wall,\" nor the\nold, eternally-told passion of \"Edward Gray:\"\n\n    Love may come and love may go,\n    And fly like a bird from tree to tree.\n    But I will love no more, no more\n    Till Ellen Adair come back to me.\n\nYes, Alfred Tennyson's is a superb character, and will help give\nillustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our Nineteenth\nCentury. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation\nof stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts,\nswervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are\nlike the voyagers of a ship, casting off for new seas, distant shores.\nWe would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering\nand magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once\nimpell'd to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our\nfathers stay'd, and live as they lived.\n\nMay-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human, and\npay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize\nthat here is a great and ardent Nation that absorbs his songs, and has\na respect and affection for him personally, as almost for no other\nforeigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as\nconveying no more than the simple truth; and that truth (a little\nChristmas gift) no slight one either. I have written impromptu, and\nshall let it all go at that. The readers of more than fifty millions of\npeople in the New World not only owe to him some of their most agreeable\nand harmless and healthy hours, but he has enter'd into the formative\ninfluences of character here, not only in the Atlantic cities, but\ninland and far West, out in Missouri, in Kansas, and away in Oregon, in\nfarmer's house and miner's cabin.\n\nBest thanks, anyhow, to Alfred Tennyson--thanks and appreciation in\nAmerica's name.\n\n\n\n\nSLANG IN AMERICA\n\n\nView'd freely, the English language is the accretion and growth of every\ndialect, race, and range of time, and is both the free and compacted\ncomposition of all. From this point of view, it stands for Language in\nthe largest sense, and is really the greatest of studies. It involves so\nmuch; is indeed a sort of universal absorber, combiner, and conqueror.\nThe scope of its etymologies is the scope not only of man and\ncivilization, but the history of Nature in all departments, and of the\norganic Universe, brought up to date; for all are comprehended in words,\nand their backgrounds. This is when words become vitaliz'd, and stand\nfor things, as they unerringly and soon come to do, in the mind that\nenters on their study with fitting spirit, grasp, and appreciation.\n\nSlang, profoundly consider'd, is the lawless germinal element, below\nall words and sentences, and behind all poetry, and proves a certain\nperennial rankness and protestantism in speech. As the United States\ninherit by far their most precious possession--the language they talk\nand write--from the Old World, under and out of its feudal institutes,\nI will allow myself to borrow a simile even of those forms farthest\nremoved from American Democracy. Considering Language then as some\nmighty potentate, into the majestic audience-hall of the monarch ever\nenters a personage like one of Shakspere's clowns, and takes position\nthere, and plays a part even in the stateliest ceremonies. Such is\nSlang, or indirection, an attempt of common humanity to escape from\nbald literalism, and express itself illimitably, which in highest walks\nproduces poets and poems, and doubtless in pre-historic times gave\nthe start to, and perfected, the whole immense tangle of the old\nmythologies. For, curious as it may appear, it is strictly the\nsame impulse-source, the same thing. Slang, too, is the wholesome\nfermentation or eructation of those processes eternally active in\nlanguage, by which froth and specks are thrown up, mostly to pass away;\nthough occasionally to settle and permanently crystallize.\n\nTo make it plainer, it is certain that many of the oldest and solidest\nwords we use, were originally generated from the daring and license of\nslang. In the processes of word-formation, myriads die, but here and\nthere the attempt attracts superior meanings, becomes valuable and\nindispensable, and lives forever. Thus the term _right_ means literally\nonly straight. _Wrong_ primarily meant twisted, distorted. _Integrity_\nmeant oneness. _Spirit_ meant breath, or flame. A _supercilious_ person\nwas one who rais'd his eyebrows. To _insult_ was to leap against. If you\n_influenced_ a man, you but flow'd into him. The Hebrew word which is\ntranslated _prophesy_ meant to bubble up and pour forth as a fountain.\nThe enthusiast bubbles up with the Spirit of God within him, and\nit pours forth from him like a fountain. The word prophecy is\nmisunderstood. Many suppose that it is limited to mere prediction; that\nis but the lesser portion of prophecy. The greater work is to reveal\nGod. Every true religious enthusiast is a prophet.\n\nLanguage, be it remember'd, is not an abstract construction of the\nlearn'd, or of dictionary-makers, but is something arising out of the\nwork, needs, ties, joys, affections, tastes, of long generations of\nhumanity, and has its bases broad and low, close to the ground. Its\nfinal decisions are made by the masses, people nearest the concrete,\nhaving most to do with actual land and sea. It impermeates all, the\nPast as well as the Present, and is the grandest triumph of the human\nintellect. \"Those mighty works of art,\" says Addington Symonds,\n\"which we call languages, in the construction of which whole peoples\nunconsciously co-operated, the forms of which were determin'd not by\nindividual genius, but by the instincts of successive generations,\nacting to one end, inherent in the nature of the race--Those poems of\npure thought and fancy, cadenced not in words, but in living imagery,\nfountain-heads of inspiration, mirrors of the mind of nascent nations,\nwhich we call Mythologies--these surely are more marvellous in their\ninfantine spontaneity than any more mature production of the races which\nevolv'd them. Yet we are utterly ignorant of their embryology; the true\nscience of Origins is yet in its cradle.\"\n\nDaring as it is to say so, in the growth of Language it is certain that\nthe retrospect of slang from the start would be the recalling from\ntheir nebulous conditions of all that is poetical in the stores of human\nutterance. Moreover, the honest delving, as of late years, by the German\nand British workers in comparative philology, has pierc'd and dispers'd\nmany of the falsest bubbles of centuries; and will disperse many more.\nIt was long recorded that in Scandinavian mythology the heroes in the\nNorse Paradise drank out of the skulls of their slain enemies. Later\ninvestigation proves the word taken for skulls to mean _horns_ of beasts\nslain in the hunt. And what reader had not been exercis'd over the\ntraces of that feudal custom, by which _seigneurs_ warm'd their feet in\nthe bowels of serfs, the abdomen being open'd for the purpose? It now\nis made to appear that the serf was only required to submit his unharm'd\nabdomen as a foot cushion while his lord supp' d, and was required to\nchafe the legs of the seigneur with his hands.\n\nIt is curiously in embryons and childhood, and among the illiterate,\nwe always find the groundwork and start, of this great science, and its\nnoblest products. What a relief most people have in speaking of a man\nnot by his true and formal name, with a \"Mister\" to it, but by some odd\nor homely appellative. The propensity to approach a meaning not directly\nand squarely, but by circuitous styles of expression, seems indeed a\nborn quality of the common people everywhere, evidenced by nick-names,\nand the inveterate determination of the masses to bestow sub-titles,\nsometimes ridiculous, sometimes very apt. Always among the soldiers\nduring the secession war, one heard of \"Little Mac\" (Gen. McClellan),\nor of \"Uncle Billy\" (Gen. Sherman.) \"The old man\" was, of course, very\ncommon. Among the rank and file, both armies, it was very general to\nspeak of the different States they came from by their slang names.\nThose from Maine were call'd Foxes; New Hampshire, Granite Boys;\nMassachusetts, Bay Staters; Vermont, Green Mountain Boys; Rhode Island,\nGun Flints; Connecticut, Wooden Nutmegs; New York, Knickerbockers; New\nJersey, Clam Catchers; Pennsylvania, Logher Heads; Delaware, Muskrats;\nMaryland, Claw Thumpers; Virginia, Beagles; North Carolina, Tar Boilers;\nSouth Carolina, Weasels; Georgia, Buzzards; Louisiana, Creoles; Alabama,\nLizards; Kentucky, Corn Crackers; Ohio, Buckeyes; Michigan, Wolverines;\nIndiana, Hoosiers; Illinois, Suckers; Missouri, Pukes; Mississippi,\nTadpoles; Florida, Fly up the Creeks; Wisconsin, Badgers; Iowa,\nHawkeyes; Oregon, Hard Cases. Indeed I am not sure but slang names have\nmore than once made Presidents. \"Old Hickory,\" (Gen. Jackson) is one\ncase in point. \"Tippecanoe, and Tyler too,\" another.\n\nI find the same rule in the people's conversations everywhere. I heard\nthis among the men of the city horse-cars, where the conductor is\noften call'd a \"snatcher\" (i. e. because his characteristic duty is to\nconstantly pull or snatch the bell-strap, to stop or go on.) Two young\nfellows are having a friendly talk, amid which, says 1st conductor,\n\"What did you do before you was a snatcher?\" Answer of 2d conductor,\n\"Nail'd.\" (Translation of answer: \"I work'd as carpenter.\") What is a\n\"boom\"? says one editor to another. \"Esteem'd contemporary,\" says the\nother, \"a boom is a bulge.\" \"Barefoot whiskey\" is the Tennessee name for\nthe undiluted stimulant. In the slang of the New York common restaurant\nwaiters a plate of ham and beans is known as \"stars and stripes,\"\ncodfish balls as \"sleeve-buttons,\" and hash as \"mystery.\"\n\nThe Western States of the Union are, however, as may be supposed,\nthe special areas of slang, not only in conversation, but in names of\nlocalities, towns, rivers, etc. A late Oregon traveller says:\n\n\"On your way to Olympia by rail, you cross a river called the\nShookum-Chuck; your train stops at places named Newaukum, Tumwater, and\nToutle; and if you seek further you will hear of whole counties labell'\nd Wahkiakum, or Snohomish, or Kitsar, or Klikatat; and Cowlitz, Hookium,\nand Nenolelops greet and offend you. They complain in Olympia that\nWashington Territory gets but little immigration; but what wonder? What\nman, having the whole American continent to choose from, would willingly\ndate his letters from the county of Snohomish or bring up his children\nin the city of Nenolelops? The village of Tumwater is, as I am ready\nto bear witness, very pretty indeed; but surely an emigrant would think\ntwice before he establish' d himself either there or at Toutle. Seattle\nis sufficiently barbarous; Stelicoom is no better; and I suspect that\nthe Northern Pacific Railroad terminus has been fixed at Tacoma because\nit is one of the few places on Puget Sound whose name does not inspire\nhorror.\"\n\nThen a Nevada paper chronicles the departure of a mining party from\nReno: \"The toughest set of roosters that ever shook the dust off any\ntown left Reno yesterday for the new mining district of Cornucopia.\nThey came here from Virginia. Among the crowd were four New York\ncock-fighters, two Chicago murderers, three Baltimore bruisers, one\nPhiladelphia prize-fighter, four San Francisco hoodlums, three Virginia\nbeats, two Union Pacific roughs, and two check guerrillas.\" Among\nthe far-west newspapers, have been, or are, _The Fairplay_ (Colorado)\n_Flume, The Solid Muldoon_, of Ouray, _The Tombstone Epitaph_, of\nNevada, _The Jimplecute_, of Texas, and _The Bazoo_, of Missouri.\nShirttail Bend, Whiskey Flat, Puppytown, Wild Yankee Ranch, Squaw Flat,\nRawhide Ranch, Loafer's Ravine, Squitch Gulch, Toenail Lake, are a few\nof the names of places in Butte county, Cal.\n\nPerhaps indeed no place or term gives more luxuriant illustrations of\nthe fermentation processes I have mention'd, and their froth and specks,\nthan those Mississippi and Pacific coast regions, at the present\nday. Hasty and grotesque as are some of the names, others are of an\nappropriateness and originality unsurpassable. This applies to the\nIndian words, which are often perfect. Oklahoma is proposed in Congress\nfor the name of one of our new Territories. Hog-eye, Lick-skillet,\nRake-pocket and Steal-easy are the names of some Texan towns. Miss\nBremer found among the aborigines the following names: _Men's_,\nHorn-point; Round-Wind; Stand-and-look-out; The-Cloud-that-goes-aside;\nIron-toe; Seek-the-sun; Iron-flash; Red-bottle; White-spindle;\nBlack-dog; Two-feathers-of-honor; Gray-grass; Bushy-tail; Thunder-face;\nGo-on-the-burning-sod; Spirits-of-the-dead. _Women's_, Keep-the-fire;\nSpiritual-woman; Second-daughter-of-the-house; Blue-bird.\n\nCertainly philologists have not given enough attention to this element\nand its results, which, I repeat, can probably be found working every\nwhere to-day, amid modern conditions, with as much life and activity as\nin far-back Greece or India, under prehistoric ones. Then the wit--the\nrich flashes of humor and genius and poetry--darting out often from a\ngang of laborers, railroad-men, miners, drivers or boatmen! How often\nhave I hover'd at the edge of a crowd of them, to hear their repartees\nand impromptus! You get more real fun from half an hour with them than\nfrom the books of all \"the American humorists.\"\n\nThe science of language has large and close analogies in geological\nscience, with its ceaseless evolution, its fossils, and its numberless\nsubmerged layers and hidden strata, the infinite go-before of the\npresent. Or, perhaps Language is more like some vast living body, or\nperennial body of bodies. And slang not only brings the first feeders\nof it, but is afterward the start of fancy, imagination and humor,\nbreathing into its nostrils the breath of life.\n\n\n\n\nAN INDIAN BUREAU REMINISCENCE\n\n\nAfter the close of the secession war in 1865, I work'd several months\n(until Mr. Harlan turn'd me out for having written \"Leaves of Grass\") in\nthe Interior Department at Washington, in the Indian Bureau. Along\nthis time there came to see their Great Father an unusual number of\naboriginal visitors, delegations for treaties, settlement of lands,\n&c.--some young or middle-aged, but mainly old men, from the West,\nNorth, and occasionally from the South--parties of from five to twenty\neach--the most wonderful proofs of what Nature can produce, (the\nsurvival of the fittest, no doubt--all the frailer samples dropt, sorted\nout by death)--as if to show how the earth and woods, the attrition of\nstorms and elements, and the exigencies of life at first hand, can\ntrain and fashion men, indeed _chiefs_, in heroic massiveness,\nimperturbability, muscle, and that last and highest beauty consisting\nof strength--the full exploitation and fruitage of a human identity, not\nfrom the culmination-points of \"culture\" and artificial civilization,\nbut tallying our race, as it were, with giant, vital, gnarl'd, enduring\ntrees, or monoliths of separate hardiest rocks, and humanity holding its\nown with the best of the said trees or rocks, and outdoing them.\n\nThere were Omahas, Poncas, Winnebagoes, Cheyennes, Navahos, Apaches,\nand many others. Let me give a running account of what I see and hear\nthrough one of these conference collections at the Indian Bureau, going\nback to the present tense. Every head and face is impressive, even\nartistic; Nature redeems herself out of her crudest recesses. Most have\nred paint on their cheeks, however, or some other paint. (\"Little Hill\"\nmakes the opening speech, which the interpreter translates by scraps.)\nMany wear head tires of gaudy-color'd braid, wound around thickly--some\nwith circlets of eagles' feathers. Necklaces of bears' claws are plenty\naround their necks. Most of the chiefs are wrapt in large blankets of\nthe brightest scarlet.\n\nTwo or three have blue, and I see one black. (A wise man call'd \"the\nFlesh\" now makes a short speech, apparently asking something. Indian\nCommissioner Dole answers him, and the interpreter translates in scraps\nagain.) All the principal chiefs have tomahawks or hatchets, some\nof them very richly ornamented and costly. Plaid shirts are to be\nobserv'd--none too clean. Now a tall fellow, \"Hole-in-the-Day,\" is\nspeaking. He has a copious head-dress composed of feathers and narrow\nribbon, under which appears a countenance painted all over a\nbilious yellow. Let us note this young chief. For all his paint,\n\"Hole-in-the-Day\" is a handsome Indian, mild and calm, dress'd in drab\nbuckskin leggings, dark gray surtout, and a soft black hat. His costume\nwill bear full observation, and even fashion would accept him. His\napparel is worn loose and scant enough to show his superb physique,\nespecially in neck, chest, and legs. (\"The Apollo Belvidere!\" was the\ninvoluntary exclamation of a famous European artist when he first saw a\nfull-grown young Choctaw.)\n\nOne of the red visitors--a wild, lean-looking Indian, the one in the\nblack woolen wrapper--has an empty buffalo head, with the horns on, for\nhis personal surmounting. I see a markedly Bourbonish countenance among\nthe chiefs--(it is not very uncommon among them, I am told.) Most of\nthem avoided resting on chairs during the hour of their \"talk\" in the\nCommissioner's office; they would sit around on the floor, leaning\nagainst something, or stand up by the walls, partially wrapt in their\nblankets. Though some of the young fellows were, as I have said,\nmagnificent and beautiful animals, I think the palm of unique\npicturesqueness, in body, limb, physiognomy, &c., was borne by the old\nor elderly chiefs, and the wise men.\n\nMy here-alluded-to experience in the Indian Bureau produced one\nvery definite conviction, as follows: There is something about these\naboriginal Americans, in their highest characteristic representations,\nessential traits, and the ensemble of their physique and\nphysiognomy--something very remote, very lofty, arousing comparisons\nwith our own civilized ideals--something that our literature, portrait\npainting, &c., have never caught, and that will almost certainly never\nbe transmitted to the future, even as a reminiscence. No biographer, no\nhistorian, no artist, has grasp'd it--perhaps could not grasp it. It is\nso different, so far outside our standards of eminent humanity. Their\nfeathers, paint--even the empty buffalo skull--did not, to say the\nleast, seem any more ludicrous to me than many of the fashions I have\nseen in civilized society. I should not apply the word savage (at any\nrate, in the usual sense) as a leading word in the description of those\ngreat aboriginal specimens, of whom I certainly saw many of the best.\nThere were moments, as I look'd at them or studied them, when our own\nexemplification of personality, dignity, heroic presentation anyhow (as\nin the conventions of society, or even in the accepted poems and plays,)\nseem'd sickly, puny, inferior.\n\nThe interpreters, agents of the Indian Department, or other whites\naccompanying the bands, in positions of responsibility, were always\ninteresting to me; I had many talks with them. Occasionally I would go\nto the hotels where the bands were quarter'd, and spend an hour or\ntwo informally. Of course we could not have much conversation--though\n(through the interpreters) more of this than might be\nsupposed--sometimes quite animated and significant. I had the good\nluck to be invariably receiv'd and treated by all of them in their most\ncordial manner.\n\n[Letter to W. W. from an artist, B. H., who has been much among the\nAmerican Indians:]\n\n\"I have just receiv'd your little paper on the Indian delegations. In\nthe fourth paragraph you say that there is something about the\nessential traits of our aborigines which 'will almost certainly never be\ntransmitted to the future.' If I am so fortunate as to regain my health\nI hope to weaken the force of that statement, at least in so far as\nmy talent and training will permit. I intend to spend some years among\nthem, and shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer\ntypes, both men and women, and some of the characteristic features\nof their life. It will certainly be well worth the while. My artistic\nenthusiasm was never so thoroughly stirr'd up as by the Indians. They\ncertainly have more of beauty, dignity and nobility mingled with their\nown wild individuality, than any of the other indigenous types of man.\nNeither black nor Afghan, Arab nor Malay (and I know them all pretty\nwell) can hold a candle to the Indian. All of the other aboriginal\ntypes seem to be more or less distorted from the model of perfect human\nform--as we know it--the blacks, thin-hipped, with bulbous limbs, not\nwell mark'd; the Arabs large-jointed, &c. But I have seen many a young\nIndian as perfect in form and feature as a Greek statue--very different\nfrom a Greek statue, of course, but as satisfying to the artistic\nperceptions and demand.\n\n\"And the worst, or perhaps the best of it all is that it will require\nan artist--and a good one--to record the real facts and impressions. Ten\nthousand photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt\npainting. Color is all-important. No one but an artist knows how much.\nAn Indian is only half an Indian without the blue-black hair and\nthe brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful dusky ochre and rose\ncomplexion.\"\n\n\n\n\nSOME DIARY NOTES AT RANDOM\n\n\nNEGRO SLAVES IN NEW YORK\n\nI can myself almost remember negro slaves in New York State, as my\ngrandfather and great-grandfather (at West Hills, Suffolk county, New\nYork) own'd a number. The hard labor of the farm was mostly done by\nthem, and on the floor of the big kitchen, toward sundown, would be\nsquatting a circle of twelve or fourteen \"pickaninnies,\" eating\ntheir supper of pudding (Indian corn mush) and milk. A friend of my\ngrandfather, named Wortman, of Oyster Bay, died in 1810, leaving ten\nslaves. Jeanette Treadwell, the last of them, died suddenly in Flushing\nlast summer (1884,) at the age of ninety-four years. I remember \"old\nMose,\" one of the liberated West Hills slaves, well. He was very genial,\ncorrect, manly, and cute, and a great friend of my childhood.\n\n\n\nCANADA NIGHTS--_Late in August_--\n\nThree wondrous nights. Effects of moon, clouds, stars, and night-sheen,\nnever surpass'd. I am out every night, enjoying all. The sunset begins\nit. (I have said already how long evening lingers here.) The moon, an\nhour high just after eight, is past her half, and looks somehow more\nlike a human face up there than ever before. As it grows later, we have\nsuch gorgeous and broad cloud-effects, with Luna's tawny halos,\nsilver edgings--great fleeces, depths of blue-black in patches, and\noccasionally long, low bars hanging silently a while, and then gray\nbulging masses rolling along stately, sometimes in long procession.\nThe moon travels in Scorpion to-night, and dims all the stars of that\nconstellation except fiery Antares, who keeps on shining just to the big\none's side.\n\n\nCOUNTRY DAYS AND NIGHTS--\n\n_Sept. 30, '82, 4.30 A.M._--I am down in Camden county, New Jersey, at\nthe farmhouse of the Staffords--have been looking a long while at\nthe comet--have in my time seen longer-tail'd ones, but never one so\npronounc'd in cometary character, and so spectral-fierce--so like some\ngreat, pale, living monster of the air or sea. The atmosphere and sky,\nan hour or so before sunrise, so cool, still, translucent, give the\nwhole apparition to great advantage. It is low in the east. The head\nshows about as big as an ordinary good-sized saucer--is a perfectly\nround and defined disk--the tail some sixty or seventy feet--not a\nstripe, but quite broad, and gradually expanding. Impress'd with the\nsilent, inexplicably emotional sight, I linger and look till all begins\nto weaken in the break of day.\n\n_October 2_.--The third day of mellow, delicious, sunshiny weather. I\nam writing this in the recesses of the old woods, my seat on a big pine\nlog, my back against a tree. Am down here a few days for a change, to\nbask in the Autumn sun, to idle lusciously and simply, and to eat hearty\nmeals, especially my breakfast. Warm mid-days--the other hours of\nthe twenty-four delightfully fresh and mild--cool evenings, and early\nmornings perfect. The scent of the woods, and the peculiar aroma of a\ngreat yet unreap'd maize-field near by--the white butterflies in every\ndirection by day--the golden-rod, the wild asters, and sunflowers--the\nsong of the katydid all night.\n\nEvery day in Cooper's Woods, enjoying simple existence and the passing\nhours--taking short walks--exercising arms and chest with the saplings,\nor my voice with army songs or recitations. A perfect week for weather;\nseven continuous days bright and dry and cool and sunny. The nights\nsplendid, with full moon--about 10 the grandest of star-shows up in the\neast and south, Jupiter, Saturn, Capella, Aldebaran, and great Orion.\nAm feeling pretty well--am outdoors most of the time, absorbing the days\nand nights all I can.\n\n\nCENTRAL PARK NOTES\n\n_American Society from a Park Policeman's Point of View_\n\nAm in New York city, upper part--visit Central Park almost every day\n(and have for the last three weeks) off and on, taking observations or\nshort rambles, and sometimes riding around. I talk quite a good deal\nwith one of the Park policemen, C.C., up toward the Ninetieth street\nentrance. One day in particular I got him a-going, and it proved deeply\ninteresting to me. Our talk floated into sociology and politics. I\nwas curious to find how these things appear'd on their surfaces to my\nfriend, for he plainly possess'd sharp wits and good nature, and had\nbeen seeing, for years, broad streaks of humanity somewhat out of\nmy latitude. I found that as he took such appearances the inward\ncaste-spirit of European \"aristocracy\" pervaded rich America, with\ncynicism and artificiality at the fore. Of the bulk of official persons,\nExecutives, Congressmen, Legislators, Aldermen, Department heads, &c.,\n&c., or the candidates for those positions, nineteen in twenty, in the\npoliceman's judgment, were just players in a game. Liberty, Equality,\nUnion, and all the grand words of the Republic, were, in their mouths,\nbut lures, decoys, chisel'd likenesses of dead wood, to catch the\nmasses. Of fine afternoons, along the broad tracks of the Park, for many\nyears, had swept by my friend, as he stood on guard, the carriages, &c.,\nof American Gentility, not by dozens and scores, but by hundreds\nand thousands. Lucky brokers, capitalists, contractors, grocery-men,\nsuccessful political strikers, rich butchers, dry goods' folk, &c. And\non a large proportion of these vehicles, on panels or horse-trappings,\nwere conspicuously borne _heraldic family crests_. (Can this really be\ntrue?) In wish and willingness (and if that were so, what matter about\nthe reality?) titles of nobility, with a court and spheres fit for the\ncapitalists, the highly educated, and the carriage-riding classes--to\nfence them off from \"the common people\"--were the heart's desire of the\n\"good society\" of our great cities--aye, of North and South.\n\nSo much for my police friend's speculations--which rather took me\naback--and which I have thought I would just print as he gave them (as a\ndoctor records symptoms.)\n\n\nPLATE GLASS NOTES\n\n_St. Louis, Missouri, November, '79_.--What do you think I find\nmanufactur'd out here--and of a kind the clearest and largest, best, and\nthe most finish'd and luxurious in the world--and with ample demand\nfor it too? _Plate glass_! One would suppose that was the last dainty\noutcome of an old, almost effete-growing civilization; and yet here it\nis, a few miles from St. Louis, on a charming little river, in the wilds\nof the West, near the Mississippi. I went down that way to-day by the\nIron Mountain Railroad--was switch'd off on a side-track four miles\nthrough woods and ravines, to Swash Creek, so-call'd, and there found\nCrystal city, and immense Glass Works, built (and evidently built to\nstay) right in the pleasant rolling forest. Spent most of the day, and\nexamin'd the inexhaustible and peculiar sand the glass is made of--the\noriginal whity-gray stuff in the banks--saw the melting in the pots (a\nwondrous process, a real poem)--saw the delicate preparation the clay\nmaterial undergoes for these great pots (it has to be kneaded finally\nby human feet, no machinery answering, and I watch'd the picturesque\nbare-legged Africans treading it)--saw the molten stuff (a great mass\nof a glowing pale yellow color) taken out of the furnaces (I shall never\nforget that Pot, shape, color, concomitants, more beautiful than any\nantique statue,) pass'd into the adjoining casting-room, lifted by\npowerful machinery, pour'd out on its bed (all glowing, a newer, vaster\nstudy for colorists, indescribable, a pale red-tinged yellow, of tarry\nconsistence, all lambent,) roll'd by a heavy roller into rough plate\nglass, I should say ten feet by fourteen, then rapidly shov'd into the\nannealing oven, which stood ready for it. The polishing and grinding\nrooms afterward--the great glass slabs, hundreds of them, on their flat\nbeds, and the see-saw music of the steam machinery constantly at work\npolishing them--the myriads of human figures (the works employ'd\n400 men) moving about, with swart arms and necks, and no superfluous\nclothing--the vast, rude halls, with immense play of shifting shade, and\nslow-moving currents of smoke and steam, and shafts of light, sometimes\nsun, striking in from above with effects that would have fill'd Michel\nAngelo with rapture.\n\nComing back to St. Louis this evening, at sundown, and for over an\nhour afterward, we follow'd the Mississippi, close by its western\nbank, giving me an ampler view of the river, and with effects a little\ndifferent from any yet. In the eastern sky hung the planet Mars, just\nup, and of a very clear and vivid yellow. It was a soothing and pensive\nhour--the spread of the river off there in the half-light--the glints\nof the down-bound steamboats plodding along--and that yellow orb\n(apparently twice as large and significant as usual) above the Illinois\nshore. (All along, these nights, nothing can exceed the calm, fierce,\ngolden, glistening domination of Mars over all the stars in the sky.)\n\nAs we came nearer St. Louis, the night having well set in, I saw some\n(to me) novel effects in the zinc smelting establishments, the tall\nchimneys belching flames at the top, while inside through the openings\nat the facades of the great tanks burst forth (in regular position)\nhundreds of fierce tufts of a peculiar blue (or green) flame, of a\npurity and intensity, like electric lights--illuminating not only the\ngreat buildings themselves, but far and near outside, like hues of the\naurora borealis, only more vivid. (So that--remembering the Pot from the\ncrystal furnace--my jaunt seem'd to give me new revelations in the color\nline.)\n\n\n\n\nSOME WAR MEMORANDA\n\n_Jotted Down at the Time_\n\n\nI find this incident in my notes (I suppose from \"chinning\" in hospital\nwith some sick or wounded soldier who knew of it):\n\nWhen Kilpatrick and his forces were cut off at Brandy station (last\nof September, '63, or thereabouts,) and the bands struck up \"Yankee\nDoodle,\" there were not cannon enough in the Southern Confederacy to\nkeep him and them \"in.\" It was when Meade fell back. K. had his large\ncavalry division (perhaps 5,000 men,) but the rebs, in superior force,\nhad surrounded them. Things look'd exceedingly desperate. K. had two\nfine bands, and order'd them up immediately; they join'd and play'd\n\"Yankee Doodle\" with a will! It went through the men like lightning--but\nto inspire, not to unnerve. Every man seem'd a giant. They charged like\na cyclone, and cut their way out. Their loss was but 20. It was about\ntwo in the afternoon.\n\n\nWASHINGTON STREET SCENES\n\n_Walking Down Pennsylvania Avenue_\n\n_April 7, 1864_.--Warmish forenoon, after the storm of the past few\ndays. I see, passing up, in the broad space between the curbs, a big\nsquad of a couple of hundred conscripts, surrounded by a strong\ncordon of arm'd guards, and others interspers'd between the ranks. The\ngovernment has learn'd caution from its experiences; there are many\nhundreds of \"bounty jumpers,\" and already, as I am told, eighty thousand\ndeserters! Next (also passing up the Avenue,) a cavalry company, young,\nbut evidently well drill'd and service-harden'd men. Mark the upright\nposture in their saddles, the bronz'd and bearded young faces, the easy\nswaying to the motions of the horses, and the carbines by their right\nknees; handsome and reckless, some eighty of them, riding with rapid\ngait, clattering along. Then the tinkling bells of passing cars, the\nmany shops (some with large show-windows, some with swords, straps\nfor the shoulders of different ranks, hat-cords with acorns, or other\ninsignia,) the military patrol marching along, with the orderly or\nsecond-lieutenant stopping different ones to examine passes--the forms,\nthe faces, all sorts crowded together, the worn and pale, the pleas'd,\nsome on their way to the railroad depot going home, the cripples, the\ndarkeys, the long trains of government wagons, or the sad strings of\nambulances conveying wounded--the many officers' horses tied in front\nof the drinking or oyster saloons, or held by black men or boys, or\norderlies.\n\n\nTHE 195TH PENNSYLVANIA\n\n_Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1865_.--About 3 o'clock this afternoon (sun broiling\nhot) in Fifteenth street, by the Treasury building, a large and handsome\nregiment, 195th Pennsylvania, were marching by--as it happen'd, receiv'd\norders just here to halt and break ranks, so that they might rest\nthemselves awhile. I thought I never saw a finer set of men--so hardy,\ncandid, bright American looks, all weather-beaten, and with warm\nclothes. Every man was home-born. My heart was much drawn toward them.\nThey seem'd very tired, red, and streaming with sweat. It is a one-year\nregiment, mostly from Lancaster county, Pa.; have been in Shenandoah\nvalley. On halting, the men unhitch'd their knapsacks, and sat down to\nrest themselves. Some lay flat on the pavement or under trees. The fine\nphysical appearance of the whole body was remarkable. Great, very\ngreat, must be the State where such young farmers and mechanics are\nthe practical average. I went around for half an hour and talk'd with\nseveral of them, sometimes squatting down with the groups.\n\n\nLEFT-HAND WRITING BY SOLDIERS\n\n_April 30, 1866_.--Here is a single significant fact, from which one may\njudge of the character of the American soldiers in this just concluded\nwar: A gentleman in New York city, a while since, took it into his head\nto collect specimens of writing from soldiers who had lost their right\nhands in battle, and afterwards learn'd to use the left. He gave\npublic notice of his desire, and offer'd prizes for the best of these\nspecimens. Pretty soon they began to come in, and by the time specified\nfor awarding the prizes three hundred samples of such left-hand writing\nby maim'd soldiers had arrived.\n\nI have just been looking over some of this writing. A great many of the\nspecimens are written in a beautiful manner. All are good. The writing\nin nearly all cases slants backward instead of forward. One piece of\nwriting, from a soldier who had lost both arms, was made by holding the\npen in his mouth.\n\n\nCENTRAL VIRGINIA IN '64\n\nCulpepper, where I am stopping, looks like a place of two or three\nthousand inhabitants. Must be one of the pleasantest towns in Virginia.\nEven now, dilapidated fences, all broken down, windows out, it has the\nremains of much beauty. I am standing on an eminence overlooking the\ntown, though within its limits. To the west the long Blue Mountain range\nis very plain, looks quite near, though from 30 to 50 miles distant,\nwith some gray splashes of snow yet visible. The show is varied and\nfascinating. I see a great eagle up there in the air sailing with pois'd\nwings, quite low. Squads of red-legged soldiers are drilling; I suppose\nsome of the new men of the Brooklyn 14th; they march off presently with\nmuskets on their shoulders. In another place, just below me, are some\nsoldiers squaring off logs to build a shanty--chopping away, and the\nnoise of the axes sounding sharp. I hear the bellowing, unmusical\nscreech of the mule. I mark the thin blue smoke rising from camp fires.\nJust below me is a collection of hospital tents, with a yellow flag\nelevated on a stick, and moving languidly in the breeze. Two discharged\nmen (I know them both) are just leaving. One is so weak he can hardly\nwalk; the other is stronger, and carries his comrade's musket. They move\nslowly along the muddy road toward the depot. The scenery is full of\nbreadth, and spread on the most generous scale (everywhere in Virginia\nthis thought fill'd me.) The sights, the scenes, the groups, have been\nvaried and picturesque here beyond description, and remain so.\n\nI heard the men return in force the other night--heard the shouting, and\ngot up and went out to hear what was the matter. That night scene of\nso many hundred tramping steadily by, through the mud (some big flaring\ntorches of pine knots,) I shall never forget. I like to go to the\npaymaster's tent, and watch the men getting paid off. Some have\nfurloughs, and start at once for home, sometimes amid great chaffing and\nblarneying. There is every day the sound of the wood-chopping axe, and\nthe plentiful sight of negroes, crows, and mud. I note large droves and\npens of cattle. The teamsters have camps of their own, and I go often\namong them. The officers occasionally invite me to dinner or supper at\nheadquarters. The fare is plain, but you get something good to drink,\nand plenty of it. Gen. Meade is absent; Sedgwick is in command.\n\n\nPAYING THE 1ST U. S. C. T.\n\nOne of my war time reminiscences comprises the quiet side scene of\na visit I made to the First Regiment U. S. Color'd Troops, at their\nencampment, and on the occasion of their first paying off, July 11,\n1863. Though there is now no difference of opinion worth mentioning,\nthere was a powerful opposition to enlisting blacks during the\nearlier years of the secession war. Even then, however, they had their\nchampions. \"That the color'd race,\" said a good authority, \"is capable\nof military training and efficiency, is demonstrated by the testimony\nof numberless witnesses, and by the eagerness display'd in the raising,\norganizing, and drilling of African troops. Few white regiments make a\nbetter appearance on parade than the First and Second Louisiana\nNative Guards. The same remark is true of other color'd regiments. At\nMilliken's Bend, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, on Morris Island, and\nwherever tested, they have exhibited determin'd bravery, and compell'd\nthe plaudits alike of the thoughtful and thoughtless soldiery. During\nthe siege of Port Hudson the question was often ask'd those who beheld\ntheir resolute charges, how the 'niggers' behav'd under fire; and\nwithout exception the answer was complimentary to them. 'O, tip-top!'\n'first-rate!' 'bully!' were the usual replies. But I did not start out\nto argue the case--only to give my reminiscence literally, as jotted on\nthe spot at the time.\"\n\nI write this on Mason's (otherwise Analostan) island, under the fine\nshade trees of an old white stucco house, with big rooms; the white\nstucco house, originally a fine country seat (tradition says the famous\nVirginia Mason, author of the Fugitive Slave Law, was born here.)\nI reach'd the spot from my Washington quarters by ambulance up\nPennsylvania avenue, through Georgetown, across the Aqueduct bridge, and\naround through a cut and winding road, with rocks and many bad gullies\nnot lacking. After reaching the island, we get presently in the midst of\nthe camp of the 1st Regiment U. S. C. T. The tents look clean and good;\nindeed, altogether, in locality especially, the pleasantest camp I have\nyet seen. The spot is umbrageous, high and dry, with distant sounds of\nthe city, and the puffing steamers of the Potomac, up to Georgetown and\nback again. Birds are singing in the trees, the warmth is endurable here\nin this moist shade, with the fragrance and freshness. A hundred rods\nacross is Georgetown. The river between is swell'd and muddy from the\nlate rains up country. So quiet here, yet full of vitality, all around\nin the far distance glimpses, as I sweep my eye, of hills, verdure-clad,\nand with plenteous trees; right where I sit, locust, sassafras, spice,\nand many other trees, a few with huge parasitic vines; just at hand the\nbanks sloping to the river, wild with beautiful, free vegetation, superb\nweeds, better, in their natural growth and forms, than the best garden.\nLots of luxuriant grape vines and trumpet flowers; the river flowing far\ndown in the distance.\n\nNow the paying is to begin. The Major (paymaster) with his clerk seat\nthemselves at a table--the rolls are before them--the money box is\nopen'd--there are packages of five, ten, twenty-five cent pieces. Here\ncomes the first Company (B), some 82 men, all blacks. Certes, we cannot\nfind fault with the appearance of this crowd--negroes though they\nbe. They are manly enough, bright enough, look as if they had the\nsoldier-stuff in them, look hardy, patient, many of them real handsome\nyoung fellows. The paying, I say, has begun. The men are march'd up in\nclose proximity. The clerk calls off name after name, and each walks up,\nreceives his money, and passes along out of the way. It is a real study,\nboth to see them come close, and to see them pass away, stand counting\ntheir cash--(nearly all of this company get ten dollars and three cents\neach.) The clerk calls George Washington. That distinguish'd personage\nsteps from the ranks, in the shape of a very black man, good sized and\nshaped, and aged about 30, with a military mustache; he takes his \"ten\nthree,\" and goes off evidently well pleas'd. (There are about a dozen\nWashingtons in the company. Let us hope they will do honor to the name.)\nAt the table, how quickly the Major handles the bills, counts without\ntrouble, everything going on smoothly and quickly. The regiment numbers\nto-day about 1,000 men (including 20 officers, the only whites.)\n\nNow another company. These get $5.36 each. The men look well. They, too,\nhave great names; besides the Washingtons aforesaid, John Quincy Adams,\nDaniel Webster, Calhoun, James Madison, Alfred Tennyson, John Brown,\nBenj. G. Tucker, Horace Greeley, &c. The men step off aside, count their\nmoney with a pleas'd, half-puzzled look. Occasionally, but not often,\nthere are some thoroughly African physiognomies, very black in color,\nlarge, protruding lips, low forehead, &c. But I have to say that I do\nnot see one utterly revolting face.\n\nThen another company, each man of this getting $10.03 also. The pay\nproceeds very rapidly (the calculation, roll-signing, &c., having been\narranged beforehand.) Then some trouble. One company, by the rigid rules\nof official computation, gets only 23 cents each man. The company (K)\nis indignant, and after two or three are paid, the refusal to take the\npaltry sum is universal, and the company marches off to quarters unpaid.\n\nAnother company (I) gets only 70 cents. The sullen, lowering,\ndisappointed look is general. Half refuse it in this case. Company G, in\nfull dress, with brass scales on shoulders, look'd, perhaps, as well as\nany of the companies--the men had an unusually alert look. These, then,\nare the black troops,--or the beginning of them. Well, no one can see\nthem, even under these circumstances--their military career in its\nnovitiate--without feeling well pleas'd with them.\n\nAs we enter'd the island, we saw scores at a little distance, bathing,\nwashing their clothes, &c. The officers, as far as looks go, have a fine\nappearance, have good faces, and the air military. Altogether it is a\nsignificant show, and brings up some \"abolition\" thoughts. The scene,\nthe porch of an Old Virginia slave-owner's house, the Potomac rippling\nnear, the Capitol just down three or four miles there, seen through the\npleasant blue haze of this July day.\n\nAfter a couple of hours I get tired, and go off for a ramble. I write\nthese concluding lines on a rock, under the shade of a tree on the banks\nof the island. It is solitary here, the birds singing, the sluggish\nmuddy-yellow waters pouring down from the late rains of the upper\nPotomac; the green heights on the south side of the river before me.\nThe single cannon from a neighboring fort has just been fired, to signal\nhigh noon. I have walk'd all around Analostan, enjoying its luxuriant\nwildness, and stopt in this solitary spot. A water snake wriggles down\nthe bank, disturb'd, into the water. The bank near by is fringed with a\ndense growth of shrubbery, vines, &c.\n\n\n\n\nFIVE THOUSAND POEMS\n\n\nThere have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and\nlittle American poems--all that diligent and long-continued research\ncould lay hands on! The author of 'Old Grimes is Dead' commenced\nit, more than fifty years ago; then the cluster was pass'd on and\naccumulated by C. F. Harris; then further pass'd on and added to by the\nlate Senator Anthony, from whom the whole collection has been bequeath'd\nto Brown University. A catalogue (such as it is) has been made and\npublish'd of these five thousand poems--and is probably the most curious\nand suggestive part of the whole affair. At any rate it has led me to\nsome abstract reflection like the following.\n\nI should like, for myself, to put on record my devout acknowledgment not\nonly of the great masterpieces of the past, but of the benefit of _all_\npoets, past and present, and of _all_ poetic utterance--in its entirety\nthe dominant moral factor of humanity's progress. In view of that\nprogress, and of evolution, the religious and esthetic elements, the\ndistinctive and most important of any, seem to me more indebted to\npoetry than to all other means and influences combined. In a very\nprofound sense _religion is the poetry of humanity_. Then the points of\nunion and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world, however\nwide their separations of time and place and theme, are much more\nnumerous and weighty than the points of contrast. Without relation as\nthey may seem at first sight, the whole earth's poets and poetry--_en\nmasse_--the Oriental, the Greek, and what there is of Roman--the oldest\nmyths--the interminable ballad-romances of the Middle Ages--the hymns\nand psalms of worship--the epics, plays, swarms of lyrics of the British\nIslands, or the Teutonic old or new--or modern French--or what there is\nin America, Bryant's, for instance, or Whittier's or Longfellow's--the\nverse of all tongues and ages, all forms, all subjects, from primitive\ntimes to our own day inclusive--really combine in one aggregate and\nelectric globe or universe, with all its numberless parts and radiations\nheld together by a common centre or verteber. To repeat it, all poetry\nthus has (to the point of view comprehensive enough) more features of\nresemblance than difference, and becomes essentially, like the planetary\nglobe itself, compact and orbic and whole. Nature seems to sow countless\nseeds--makes incessant crude attempts--thankful to get now and then,\neven at rare and long intervals, something approximately good.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD BOWERY\n\n\n_A Reminiscence of New York Plays and Acting Fifty Years Ago_\n\n\nIn an article not long since, \"Mrs. Siddons as Lady Macbeth,\" in \"The\nNineteenth Century,\" after describing the bitter regretfulness to\nmankind from the loss of those first-class poems, temples, pictures,\ngone and vanish'd from any record of men, the writer (Fleeming Jenkin)\ncontinues:\n\n  If this be our feeling as to the more durable works of art, what\n  shall we say of those triumphs which, by their very nature, la\n  no longer than the action which creates them--the triumphs of the\n  orator, the singer, or the actor? There is an anodyne in the words,\n  \"must be so,\" \"inevitable,\" and there is even some absurdity in\n  longing for the impossible. This anodyne and our sense of humor\n  temper the unhappiness we feel when, after hearing some great\n  performance, we leave the theatre and think, \"Well, this great thing\n  has been, and all that is now left of it is the feeble print up\n  my brain, the little thrill which memory will send along my nerves,\n  mine and my neighbors; as we live longer the print and thrill must\n  be feebler, and when we pass away the impress of the great artist\n  will vanish from the world.\" The regret that a great art should in\n  its nature be transitory, explains the lively interest which many\n  feel in reading anecdotes or descriptions of a great actor.\n\nAll this is emphatically my own feeling and reminiscence about the best\ndramatic and lyric artists I have seen in bygone days--for instance,\nMarietta Alboni, the elder Booth, Forrest, the tenor Bettini, the\nbaritone Badiali, \"old man Clarke\"--(I could write a whole paper on the\nlatter's peerless rendering of the Ghost in \"Hamlet\" at the Park, when\nI was a young fellow)--an actor named Ranger, who appear'd in America\nforty years ago in _genre_ characters; Henry Placide, and many others.\nBut I will make a few memoranda at least of the best one I knew.\n\nFor the elderly New Yorker of to-day, perhaps, nothing were more likely\nto start up memories of his early manhood than the mention of the Bowery\nand the elder Booth, At the date given, the more stylish and select\ntheatre (prices, 50 cents pit, $1 boxes) was \"The Park,\" a large and\nwell-appointed house on Park Row, opposite the present Post-office.\nEnglish opera and the old comedies were often given in capital style;\nthe principal foreign stars appear'd here, with Italian opera at\nwide intervals. The Park held a large part in my boyhood's and young\nmanhood's life. Here I heard the English actor, Anderson, in \"Charles\nde Moor,\" and in the fine part of \"Gisippus.\" Here I heard Fanny Kemble,\nCharlotte Cushman, the Seguins, Daddy Rice, Hackett as Falstaff, Nimrod\nWildfire, Rip Van Winkle, and in his Yankee characters. (See pages 19,\n20, \"Specimen Days.\") It was here (some years later than the date in the\nheadline) I also heard Mario many times, and at his best. In such parts\nas Gennaro, in \"Lucrezia Borgia,\" he was inimitable--the sweetest of\nvoices, a pure tenor, of considerable compass and respectable power. His\nwife, Grisi, was with him, no longer first-class or young--a fine Norma,\nthough, to the last.\n\nPerhaps my dearest amusement reminiscences are those musical ones. I\ndoubt if ever the senses and emotions of the future will be thrill'd as\nwere the auditors of a generation ago by the deep passion of Alboni's\ncontralto (at the Broadway Theatre, south side, near Pearl street)--or\nby the trumpet notes of Badiali's baritone, or Bettini's pensive and\nincomparable tenor in Fernando in \"Favorita,\" or Marini's bass in\n\"Faliero,\" among the Havana troupe, Castle Garden.\n\nBut getting back more specifically to the date and theme I started\nfrom--the heavy tragedy business prevail'd more decidedly at the Bowery\nTheatre, where Booth and Forrest were frequently to be heard. Though\nBooth _pere,_ then in his prime, ranging in age from 40 to 44 years (he\nwas born in 1796,) was the loyal child and continuer of the traditions\nof orthodox English play-acting, he stood out \"himself alone\" in many\nrespects beyond any of his kind on record, and with effects and ways\nthat broke through all rules and all traditions. He has been well\ndescrib'd as an actor \"whose instant and tremendous concentration of\npassion in his delineations overwhelm'd his audience, and wrought into\nit such enthusiasm that it partook of the fever of inspiration surging\nthrough his own veins.\" He seems to have been of beautiful private\ncharacter, very honorable, affectionate, good-natured, no arrogance,\nglad to give the other actors the best chances. He knew all stage points\nthoroughly, and curiously ignored the mere dignities. I once talk'd with\na man who had seen him do the Second Actor in the mock play to Charles\nKean's Hamlet in Baltimore. He was a marvellous linguist. He play'd\nShylock once in London, giving the dialogue in Hebrew, and in New\nOrleans Oreste (Racine's \"Andromaque\") in French. One trait of his\nhabits, I have heard, was strict vegetarianism. He was exceptionally\nkind to the brute creation. Every once in a while he would make a break\nfor solitude or wild freedom, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for\ndays. (He illustrated Plato's rule that to the forming an artist of the\nvery highest rank a dash of insanity or what the world calls insanity\nis indispensable.) He was a small-sized man--yet sharp observers noticed\nthat however crowded the stage might be in certain scenes, Booth\nnever seem'd overtopt or hidden. He was singularly spontaneous and\nfluctuating; in the same part each rendering differ'd from any and\nall others. He had no stereotyped positions and made no arbitrary\nrequirements on his fellow-performers.\n\nAs is well known to old play-goers, Booth's most effective part was\nRichard III. Either that, or lago, or Shylock, or Pescara in \"The\nApostate,\" was sure to draw a crowded house. (Remember heavy pieces were\nmuch more in demand those days than now.) He was also unapproachably\ngrand in Sir Giles Overreach, in \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts,\" and the\nprincipal character in \"The Iron Chest.\"\n\nIn any portraiture of Booth, those years, the Bowery Theatre, with its\nleading lights, and the lessee and manager, Thomas Hamblin, cannot be\nleft out. It was at the Bowery I first saw Edwin Forrest (the play was\nJohn Howard Payne's \"Brutus, or the Fall of Tarquin,\" and it affected\nme for weeks; or rather I might say permanently filter'd into my whole\nnature,) then in the zenith of his fame and ability. Sometimes (perhaps\na veteran's benefit night,) the Bowery would group together five or\nsix of the first-class actors of those days--Booth, Forrest, Cooper,\nHamblin, and John R. Scott, for instance. At that time and here George\nJones (\"Count Joannes\") was a young, handsome actor, and quite a\nfavorite. I remember seeing him in the title role in \"Julius Caesar,\"\nand a capital performance it was.\n\nTo return specially to the manager. Thomas Hamblin made a first-rate\nfoil to Booth, and was frequently cast with him. He had a large,\nshapely, imposing presence, and dark and flashing eyes. I remember well\nhis rendering of the main role in Maturin's \"Bertram, or the Castle\nof St. Aldobrand.\" But I thought Tom Hamblin's best acting was in the\ncomparatively minor part of Faulconbridge in \"King John\"--he himself\nevidently revell'd in the part, and took away the house's applause from\nyoung Kean (the King) and Ellen Tree (Constance,) and everybody else on\nthe stage--some time afterward at the Park. Some of the Bowery actresses\nwere remarkably good. I remember Mrs. Pritchard in \"Tour de Nesle,\" and\nMrs. McClure in \"Fatal Curiosity,\" and as Millwood in \"George Barnwell.\"\n(I wonder what old fellow reading these lines will recall the fine\ncomedietta of \"The Youth That Never Saw a Woman,\" and the jolly acting\nin it of Mrs. Herring and old Gates.)\n\nThe Bowery, now and then, was the place, too, for spectacular pieces,\nsuch as \"The Last Days of Pompeii,\" \"The Lion-Doom'd\" and the yet\nundying \"Mazeppa.\" At one time \"Jonathan Bradford, or the Murder at the\nRoadside Inn, \"had a long and crowded run; John Sefton and his brother\nWilliam acted in it. I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste, a splendid\npantomimist, and her emotional \"Wept of the Wishton-Wish.\" But certainly\nthe main \"reason for being\" of the Bowery Theatre those years was to\nfurnish the public with Forrest's and Booth's performances--the latter\nhaving a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics\nfully equal to the former--though people were divided as always. For\nsome reason or other, neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements\nat the more fashionable theatre, the Park. And it is a curious\nreminiscence, but a true one, that both these great actors and their\nperformances were taboo'd by \"polite society\" in New York and Boston\nat the time--probably as being too robustuous. But no such scruples\naffected the Bowery.\n\nRecalling from that period the occasion of either Forrest or Booth,\nany good night at the old Bowery, pack'd from ceiling to pit with\nits audience mainly of alert, well-dress'd, full-blooded young and\nmiddle-aged men, the best average of American-born mechanics--the\nemotional nature of the whole mass arous'd by the power and magnetism\nof as mighty mimes as ever trod the stage--the whole crowded auditorium,\nand what seeth'd in it, and flush'd from its faces and eyes, to me\nas much a part of the show as any--bursting forth in one of those\nlong-kept-up tempests of hand-clapping peculiar to the Bowery--no dainty\nkid-glove business, but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2,000\nfull-sinew'd men--(the inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those\novations to Edwin Forrest, welcoming him back after an absence, comes up\nto me this moment)--Such sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely\nafford to many old New Yorkers some fruitful recollections.\n\nI can yet remember (for I always scann'd an audience as rigidly as\na play) the faces of the leading authors, poets, editors, of those\ntimes--Fenimore Cooper, Bryant, Paulding, Irving, Charles King, Watson\nWebb, N. P. Willis, Hoffman, Halleck, Mumford, Morris, Leggett, L. G.\nClarke, R. A. Locke and others, occasionally peering from the first tier\nboxes; and even the great National Eminences, Presidents Adams, Jackson,\nVan Buren and Tyler, all made short visits there on their Eastern tours.\n\nAwhile after 1840 the character of the Bowery as hitherto described\ncompletely changed. Cheap prices and vulgar programmes came in. People\nwho of after years saw the pandemonium of the pit and the doings on the\nboards must not gauge by them the times and characters I am describing.\nNot but what there was more or less rankness in the crowd even then. For\ntypes of sectional New York those days--the streets East of the Bowery,\nthat intersect Division, Grand, and up to Third avenue--types that\nnever found their Dickens, or Hogarth, or Balzac, and have pass'd away\nunportraitured--the young ship-builders, cartmen, butchers, firemen (the\nold-time \"soap-lock\" or exaggerated \"Mose\" or \"Sikesey,\" of Chanfrau's\nplays,) they, too, were always to be seen in these audiences, racy of\nthe East river and the Dry Dock. Slang, wit, occasional shirt sleeves,\nand a picturesque freedom of looks and manners, with a rude good-nature\nand restless movement, were generally noticeable. Yet there never were\naudiences that paid a good actor or an interesting play the compliment\nof more sustain'd attention or quicker rapport. Then at times came the\nexceptionally decorous and intellectual congregations I have hinted it;\nfor the Bowery really furnish'd plays and players you could get nowhere\nelse. Notably, Booth always drew the best hearers; and to a specimen of\nhis acting I will now attend in some detail.\n\nI happen'd to see what has been reckon'd by experts one of the most\nmarvellous pieces of histrionism ever known. It must have been about\n1834 or '35. A favorite comedian and actress at the Bowery, Thomas Flynn\nand his wife, were to have a joint benefit, and, securing Booth for\nRichard, advertised the fact many days beforehand. The house fill'd\nearly from top to bottom. There was some uneasiness behind the scenes,\nfor the afternoon arrived, and Booth had not come from down in Maryland,\nwhere he lived. However, a few minutes before ringing-up time he made\nhis appearance in lively condition.\n\nAfter a one-act farce over, as contrast and prelude, the curtain rising\nfor the tragedy, I can, from my good seat in the pit, pretty well front,\nsee again Booth's quiet entrance from the side, as, with head bent, he\nslowly and in silence, (amid the tempest of boisterous hand-clapping,)\nwalks down the stage to the footlights with that peculiar and abstracted\ngesture, musingly kicking his sword, which he holds off from him by its\nsash. Though fifty years have pass'd since then, I can hear the clank,\nand feel the perfect following hush of perhaps three thousand people\nwaiting. (I never saw an actor who could make more of the said hush\nor wait, and hold the audience in an indescribable, half-delicious,\nhalf-irritating suspense.) And so throughout the entire play, all parts,\nvoice, atmosphere, magnetism, from\n\n    \"Now is the winter of our discontent,\"\n\nto the closing death fight with Richmond, were of the finest and\ngrandest. The latter character was play'd by a stalwart young fellow\nnamed Ingersoll. Indeed, all the renderings were wonderfully good.\nBut the great spell cast upon the mass of hearers came from Booth.\nEspecially was the dream scene very impressive. A shudder went through\nevery nervous system in the audience; it certainly did through mine.\n\nWithout question Booth was royal heir and legitimate representative of\nthe Garrick-Kemble-Siddons dramatic traditions; but he vitalized and\ngave an unnamable _race_ to those traditions with his own electric\npersonal idiosyncrasy. (As in all art-utterance it was the subtle and\npowerful something _special to the individual_ that really conquer'd.)\n\nTo me, too, Booth stands for much else besides theatricals. I consider\nthat my seeing the man those years glimps'd for me, beyond all else,\nthat inner spirit and form--the unquestionable charm and vivacity, but\nintrinsic sophistication and artificiality--crystallizing rapidly upon\nthe English stage and literature at and after Shakspere's time,\nand coming on accumulatively through the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies to the beginning, fifty or forty years ago, of those\ndisintegrating, decomposing processes now authoritatively going on. Yes;\nalthough Booth must be class'd in that antique, almost extinct school,\ninflated, stagy, rendering Shakspere (perhaps inevitably, appropriately)\nfrom the growth of arbitrary and often cockney conventions, his genius\nwas to me one of the grandest revelations of my life, a lesson of\nartistic expression. The words fire, energy, _abandon_, found in him\nunprecedented meanings. I never heard a speaker or actor who could give\nsuch a sting to hauteur or the taunt. I never heard from any other the\ncharm of unswervingly perfect vocalization without trenching at all on\nmere melody, the province of music.\n\nSo much for a Thespian temple of New York fifty years since, where\n\"sceptred tragedy went trailing by\" under the gaze of the Dry Dock\nyouth, and both players and auditors were of a character and like we\nshall never see again. And so much for the grandest histrion of modern\ntimes, as near as I can deliberately judge (and the phrenologists put\nmy \"caution\" at 7)--grander, I believe, than Kean in the expression of\nelectric passion, the prime eligibility of the tragic artist. For\nthough those brilliant years had many fine and even magnificent actors,\nundoubtedly at Booth's death (in 1852) went the last and by far the\nnoblest Roman of them all.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES TO LATE ENGLISH BOOKS\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE READER IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS--\"Specimen Days in\nAmerica\"\n\nLondon Edition, _June 1887_ If you will only take the following pages,\nas you do some long and gossippy letter written for you by a relative or\nfriend travelling through distant scenes and incidents and jotting\nthem down lazily and informally, but ever veraciously (with occasional\ndiversion of critical thought about sombody or something,) it might\nremove all formal or literary impediments at once, and bring you and me\ncloser together in the spirt in which the jottings were collated to\nbe read. You have had, and have, plenty of public events and facts\nand general statistics of America;--in the following book is a common\nindividual New World _private life_, its birth and growth, its struggles\nfor a living, its goings and comings and observations (or representative\nportions of them) amid the United States of America the last thirty or\nforty years, with their varied war and peace, their local coloring, the\nunavoidable egotism, and the lights and shades and sights and joys and\npains and sympathies common to humanity. Further introductory light may\nbe found in the paragraph, \"A Happy Hour's Command,\" and the bottom note\nbelonging to it at the beginning of the book. I have said in the text\nthat if I were required to give good reason-for-being of \"Specimen\nDays,\" I should be unable to do so. Let me fondly hope that it has at\nleast the reason and excuse of such off-hand gossippy letter as just\nalluded to, portraying American life-sights and incidents as they\nactually occurred--their presentation, making additions as far as it\ngoes, to the simple experience and association of your soul, from a\ncomrade soul;--and that also, in the volume, as below any page of mine,\nanywhere, ever remains, for seen or unseen basis-phrase, GOOD-WILL\nBETWEEN THE COMMON PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.\n\n\nADDITIONAL NOTE, 1887\n\n_To English Edition \"Specimen Days\"_\n\nAs I write these lines I still continue living in Camden, New Jersey,\nAmerica. Coming this way from Washington city, on my road to the\nsea-shore (and a temporary rest, as I supposed) in the early summer\nof 1873, I broke down disabled, and have dwelt here, as my central\nresidence, all the time since--almost 14 years. In the preceding pages\nI have described how, during those years, I partially recuperated (in\n1876) from my worst paralysis by going down to Timber creek, living\nclose to Nature, and domiciling with my dear friends George and Susan\nStafford. From 1877 or '8 to '83 or '4 I was well enough to travel\naround, considerably--journey'd westward to Kansas, leisurely exploring\nthe Prairies, and on to Denver and the Rocky Mountains; another time\nnorth to Canada, where I spent most of the summer with my friend Dr.\nBucke, and jaunted along the great lakes, and the St. Lawrence and\nSaguenay rivers; another time to Boston, to properly print the final\nedition of my poems (I was there over two months, and had a \"good\ntime.\") I have so brought out the completed \"Leaves of Grass\" during\nthis period; also \"Specimen Days,\" of which the foregoing is a\ntranscript; collected and re-edited the \"Democratic Vistas\" cluster (see\ncompanion volume to the present)--commemorated Abraham Lincoln's death,\non the successive anniversaries of its occurrence, by delivering my\nlecture on it ten or twelve times; and \"put in,\" through many a month\nand season, the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives.\n\nThus the last 14 years have pass'd. At present (end-days of March,\n1887--I am nigh entering my 69th year) I find myself continuing on here,\nquite dilapidated and even wreck'd bodily from the paralysis, &c.--but\nin _good heart_ (to use a Long Island country phrase,) and with about\nthe same mentality as ever. The worst of it is, I have been growing\nfeebler quite rapidly for a year, and now can't walk around--hardly from\none room to the next. I am forced to stay in-doors and in my big chair\nnearly all the time. We have had a sharp, dreary winter too, and it has\npinch'd me. I am alone most of the time; every week, indeed almost every\nday, write some--reminiscences, essays, sketches, for the magazines;\nand read, or rather I should say dawdle over books and papers a good\ndeal--spend half the day at that.\n\nNor can I finish this note without putting on record--wafting over sea\nfrom hence--my deepest thanks to certain friends and helpers (I would\nspecify them all and each by name, but imperative reasons, outside of\nmy own wishes, forbid,) in the British Islands, as well as in America.\nDear, even in the abstract, is such flattering unction always no doubt\nto the soul! Nigher still, if possible, I myself have been, and am\nto-day indebted to such help for my very sustenance, clothing, shelter,\nand continuity. And I would not go to the grave without briefly, but\nplainly, as I here do, acknowledging--may I not say even glorying in it?\n\n\nPREFACE TO \"DEMOCRATIC VISTAS\" WITH OTHER PAPERS--_English Edition_\n\nMainly I think I should base the request to weigh the following pages on\nthe assumption that they present, however indirectly, some views of\nthe West and Modern, or of a distinctly western and modern (American)\ntendency, about certain matters. Then, too, the pages include (by\nattempting to illustrate it,) a theory herein immediately mentioned. For\nanother and different point of the issue, the Enlightenment, Democracy\nand Fair-show of the bulk, the common people of America (from sources\nrepresenting not only the British Islands, but all the world,) means,\nat least, eligibility to Enlightenment, Democracy and Fair-show for the\nbulk, the common people of all civilized nations.\n\nThat positively \"the dry land has appeared,\" at any rate, is an\nimportant fact.\n\nAmerica is really the great test or trial case for all the problems and\npromises and speculations of humanity, and of the past and present.\n\nI say, too, we[41] are not to look so much to changes, ameliorations,\nand adaptations in Politics as to those of Literature and (thence)\ndomestic Sociology. I have accordingly in the following melange\nintroduced many themes besides political ones.\n\nSeveral of the pieces are ostensibly in explanation of my own writings;\nbut in that very process they best include and set forth their side of\nprinciples and generalities pressing vehemently for consideration our\nage.\n\nUpon the whole, it is on the atmosphere they are born in, and, (I hope)\ngive out, more than any specific piece or trait, I would care to rest.\n\nI think Literature--a new, superb, democratic literature--is to be\nthe medicine and lever, and (with Art) the chief influence in modern\ncivilization. I have myself not so much made a dead set at this theory,\nor attempted to present it directly, as admitted it to color and\nsometimes dominate what I had to say. In both Europe and America we have\nserried phalanxes who promulge and defend the political claims: I go for\nan equal force to uphold the other.\n\nWALT WHITMAN,\n\nCAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _April, 1888_.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n[41] We who, in many departments, ways, make _the building up of the\nmasses,_ by _building up grand individuals_, our shibboleth: and in\nbrief that is the marrow of this book.\n\n\n\n\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\n\nGlad am I to give--were anything better lacking--even the most brief\nand shorn testimony of Abraham Lincoln. Everything I heard about him\nauthentically, and every time I saw him (and it was my fortune through\n1862 to '65 to see, or pass a word with, or watch him, personally,\nperhaps twenty or thirty times,) added to and anneal'd my respect and\nlove at the moment. And as I dwell on what I myself heard or saw of the\nmighty Westerner, and blend it with the history and literature of my\nage, and of what I can get of all ages, and conclude it with his death,\nit seems like some tragic play, superior to all else I know--vaster and\nfierier and more convulsionary, for this America of ours, than Eschylus\nor Shakspere ever drew for Athens or for England. And then the Moral\npermeating, underlying all! the Lesson that none so remote--none so\nilliterate--no age, no class--but may directly or indirectly read!\n\nAbraham Lincoln's was really one of those characters, the best of which\nis the result of long trains of cause and effect--needing a certain\nspaciousness of time, and perhaps even remoteness, to properly enclose\nthem--having unequal'd influence on the shaping of this Republic (and\ntherefore the world) as to-day, and then far more important in\nthe future. Thus the time has by no means yet come for a thorough\nmeasurement of him. Nevertheless, we who live in his era--who have\nseen him, and heard him, face to face, and are in the midst of, or just\nparting from, the strong and strange events which he and we have had\nto do with--can in some respects bear valuable, perhaps indispensable\ntestimony concerning him.\n\nI should first like to give a very fair and characteristic likeness of\nLincoln, as I saw him and watch'd him one afternoon in Washington, for\nnearly half an hour, not long before his death. It was as he stood on\nthe balcony of the National Hotel, Pennsylvania avenue, making a short\nspeech to the crowd in front, on the occasion either of a set of\nnew colors presented to a famous Illinois regiment, or of the daring\ncapture, by the Western men, of some flags from \"the enemy,\" (which\nlatter phrase, by the by, was not used by him at all in his remarks.)\nHow the picture happen'd to be made I do not know, but I bought it a few\ndays afterward in Washington, and it was endors'd by every one to whom I\nshow'd it. Though hundreds of portraits have been made, by painters and\nphotographers, (many to pass on, by copies, to future times,) I have\nnever seen one yet that in my opinion deserv'd to be called a perfectly\n_good likeness_; nor do I believe there is really such a one in\nexistence. May I not say too, that, as there is no entirely competent\nand emblematic likeness of Abraham Lincoln in picture or statue, there\nis not--perhaps cannot be--any fully appropriate literary statement or\nsumming-up of him yet in existence?\n\nThe best way to estimate the value of Lincoln is to think what the\ncondition of America would be to-day, if he had never lived--never been\nPresident. His nomination and first election were mainly accidents,\nexperiments. Severely view'd, one cannot think very much of American\nPolitical Parties, from the beginning, after the Revolutionary War, down\nto the present time. Doubtless, while they have had their uses--have\nbeen and are \"the grass on which the cow feeds\"--and indispensable\neconomies of growth--it is undeniable that under flippant names they\nhave merely identified temporary passions, or freaks, or sometimes\nprejudice, ignorance, or hatred. The only thing like a great and worthy\nidea vitalizing a party, and making it heroic, was the enthusiasm in '64\nfor re-electing Abraham Lincoln, and the reason behind that enthusiasm.\n\nHow does this man compare with the acknowledg'd \"Father of his country\"?\nWashington was model'd on the best Saxon, and Franklin--of the age of\nthe Stuarts (rooted in the Elizabethan period)--was essentially a noble\nEnglishman, and just the kind needed for the occasions and the times of\n1776-'83. Lincoln, underneath his practicality, was far less European,\nwas quite thoroughly Western, original, essentially non-conventional,\nand had a certain sort of out-door or prairie stamp. One of the best of\nthe late commentators on Shakspere, (Professor Dowden,) makes the height\nand aggregate of his quality as a poet to be, that he thoroughly blended\nthe ideal with the practical or realistic. If this be so, I should\nsay that what Shakspere did in poetic expression, Abraham Lincoln\nessentially did in his personal and official life. I should say the\ninvisible foundations and vertebra of his character, more than any man's\nin history, were mystical, abstract, moral and spiritual--while upon all\nof them was built, and out of all of them radiated, under the control of\nthe average of circumstances, what the vulgar call _horse-sense_, and a\nlife often bent by temporary but most urgent materialistic and political\nreasons.\n\nHe seems to have been a man of indomitable firmness (even obstinacy) on\nrare occasions, involving great points; but he was generally very easy,\nflexible, tolerant, almost slouchy, respecting minor matters. I note\nthat even those reports and anecdotes intended to level him down, all\nleave the tinge of a favorable impression of him. As to his religious\nnature, it seems to me to have certainly been of the amplest,\ndeepest-rooted, loftiest kind.\n\nAlready a new generation begins to tread the stage, since the persons\nand events of the secession war. I have more than once fancied to myself\nthe time when the present century has closed, and a new one open'd,\nand the men and deeds of that contest have become somewhat vague and\nmythical-fancied perhaps in some great Western city, or group collected\ntogether, or public festival, where the days of old, of 1863, and '4 and\n'5 are discuss'd--some ancient soldier sitting in the background as the\ntalk goes on, and betraying himself by his emotion and moist eyes--like\nthe journeying Ithacan at the banquet of King Alcinoiis, when the bard\nsings the contending warriors and their battles on the plains of Troy:\n\n    \"So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes\n    Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs.\"\n\nI have fancied, I say, some such venerable relic of this time of ours,\npreserv'd to the next or still the next generation of America. I have\nfancied, on such occasion, the young men gathering around; the awe, the\neager questions: \"What! have you seen Abraham Lincoln--and heard him\nspeak--and touch'd his hand? Have you, with your own eyes, look'd on\nGrant, and Lee, and Sherman?\"\n\nDear to Democracy, to the very last! And among the paradoxes generated\nby America, not the least curious was that spectacle of all the kings\nand queens and emperors of the earth, many from remote distances,\nsending tributes of condolence and sorrow in memory of one rais'd\nthrough the commonest average of life--a rail-splitter and flat-boatman!\n\nConsider'd from contemporary points of view--who knows what the future\nmay decide?--and from the points of view of current Democracy and The\nUnion, (the only thing like passion or infatuation in the man was the\npassion for the Union of These States,) Abraham Lincoln seems to me\nthe grandest figure yet, on all the crowded canvas of the Nineteenth\nCentury.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW ORLEANS IN 1848\n\n_Walt Whitman gossips of his sojourn here years ago as a newspaper\nwriter. Notes of his trip up the Mississippi and to New York._\n\nAmong the letters brought this morning (Camden, New Jersey, Jan. 15,\n1887,) by my faithful post-office carrier, J.G., is one as follows:\n\n\"NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11, '87.--We have been informed that when you were\nyounger and less famous than now, you were in New Orleans and perhaps\nhave helped on the _Picayune_. If you have any remembrance of the\n_Picayune's_ young days, or of journalism in New Orleans of that era,\nand would put it in writing (verse or prose) for the _Picayune's_\nfiftieth year edition, Jan. 25, we shall be pleased,\" etc.\n\nIn response to which: I went down to New Orleans early in 1848 to work\non a daily newspaper, but it was not the _Picayune_, though I saw quite\na good deal of the editors of that paper, and knew its personnel and\nways. But let me indulge my pen in some gossipy recollections of that\ntime and place, with extracts from my journal up the Mississippi and\nacross the great lakes to the Hudson.\n\nProbably the influence most deeply pervading everything at that time\nthrough the United States, both in physical facts and in sentiment, was\nthe Mexican War, then just ended. Following a brilliant campaign (in\nwhich our troops had march'd to the capital city, Mexico, and taken full\npossession,) we were returning after our victory. From the situation of\nthe country, the city of New Orleans had been our channel and _entrepot_\nfor everything, going and returning. It had the best news and war\ncorrespondents; it had the most to say, through its leading papers, the\n_Picayune_ and _Delta_ especially, and its voice was readiest listen'd\nto; from it \"Chapparal\" had gone out, and his army and battle letters\nwere copied everywhere, not only in the United States, but in Europe.\nThen the social cast and results; no one who has never seen the society\nof a city under similar circumstances can understand what a strange\nvivacity and _rattle_ were given throughout by such a situation. I\nremember the crowds of soldiers, the gay young officers, going or\ncoming, the receipt of important news, the many discussions, the\nreturning wounded, and so on.\n\nI remember very well seeing Gen. Taylor with his staff and other\nofficers at the St. Charles Theatre one evening (after talking with them\nduring the day.) There was a short play on the stage, but the principal\nperformance was of Dr. Colyer's troupe of \"Model Artists,\" then in\nthe full tide of their popularity. They gave many fine groups and solo\nshows. The house was crowded with uniforms and shoulder-straps. Gen. T.\nhimself, if I remember right, was almost the only officer in civilian\nclothes; he was a jovial, old, rather stout, plain man, with a wrinkled\nand dark-yellow face, and, in ways and manners, show'd the least of\nconventional ceremony or etiquette I ever saw; he laugh'd unrestrainedly\nat everything comical. (He had a great personal resemblance to Fenimore\nCooper, the novelist, of New York.) I remember Gen. Pillow and quite a\ncluster of other militaires also present.\n\nOne of my choice amusements during my stay in New Orleans was going down\nto the old French Market, especially of a Sunday morning. The show was\na varied and curious one; among the rest, the Indian and negro hucksters\nwith their wares. For there were always fine specimens of Indians,\nboth men and women, young and old. I remember I nearly always on these\noccasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit, for my\nbreakfast, from the immense shining copper kettle of a great Creole\nmulatto woman (I believe she weigh'd 230 pounds.) I never have had\nsuch coffee since. About nice drinks, anyhow, my recollection of the\n\"cobblers\" (with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers,)\nand also the exquisite wines, and the perfect and mild French brandy,\nhelp the regretful reminiscence of my New Orleans experiences of those\ndays. And what splendid and roomy and leisurely bar-rooms! particularly\nthe grand ones of the St. Charles and St. Louis. Bargains, auctions,\nappointments, business conferences, &c., were generally held in the\nspaces or recesses of these bar-rooms.\n\nI used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the\ncrowded and bustling levees, on the banks of the river. The diagonally\nwedg'd-in boats, the stevedores, the piles of cotton and other\nmerchandise, the carts, mules, negroes, etc., afforded never-ending\nstudies and sights to me. I made acquaintances among the captains,\nboatmen, or other characters, and often had long talks with\nthem--sometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters.\nSundays I sometimes went forenoons to the old Catholic Cathedral in the\nFrench quarter. I used to walk a good deal in this arrondissement; and I\nhave deeply regretted since that I did not cultivate, while I had such\na good opportunity, the chance of better knowledge of French and Spanish\nCreole New Orleans people. (I have an idea that there is much and of\nimportance about the Latin race contributions to American nationality\nin the South and Southwest that will never be put with sympathetic\nunderstanding and tact on record.)\n\nLet me say, for better detail, that through several months (1848) I\nwork'd on a new daily paper, _The Crescent_; my situation rather a\npleasant one. My young brother, Jeff, was with me; and he not only grew\nvery homesick, but the climate of the place, and especially the water,\nseriously disagreed with him. From this and other reasons (although I\nwas quite happily fix'd) I made no very long stay in the South. In due\ntime we took passage northward for St. Louis in the \"Pride of the West\"\nsteamer, which left her wharf just at dusk. My brother was unwell,\nand lay in his berth from the moment we left till the next morning; he\nseem'd to me to be in a fever, and I felt alarm'd. However, the next\nmorning he was all right again, much to my relief.\n\nOur voyage up the Mississippi was after the same sort as the voyage,\nsome months before, down it. The shores of this great river are very\nmonotonous and dull--one continuous and rank flat, with the exception of\na meagre stretch of bluff, about the neighborhood of Natchez,\nMemphis, &c. Fortunately we had good weather, and not a great crowd of\npassengers, though the berths were all full. The \"Pride\" jogg'd along\npretty well, and put us into St. Louis about noon Saturday. After\nlooking around a little I secured passage on the steamer \"Prairie Bird,\"\n(to leave late in the afternoon,) bound up the Illinois river to La\nSalle, where we were to take canal for Chicago. During the day I rambled\nwith my brother over a large portion of the town, search'd after a\nrefectory, and, after much trouble, succeeded in getting some dinner.\n\nOur \"Prairie Bird\" started out at dark, and a couple of hours after\nthere was quite a rain and blow, which made them haul in along shore\nand tie fast. We made but thirty miles the whole night. The boat was\nexcessively crowded with passengers, and had withal so much freight that\nwe could hardly turn around. I slept on the floor, and the night was\nuncomfortable enough. The Illinois river is spotted with little villages\nwith big names, Marseilles, Naples, etc.; its banks are low, and the\nvegetation excessively rank. Peoria, some distance up, is a pleasant\ntown; I went over the place; the country back is all rich land, for sale\ncheap. Three or four miles from P., land of the first quality can be\nbought for $3 or $4 an acre. (I am transcribing from my notes written at\nthe time.)\n\nArriving at La Salle Tuesday morning, we went on board a canal-boat, had\na detention by sticking on a mud bar, and then jogg'd along at a slow\ntrot, some seventy of us, on a moderate-sized boat. (If the weather\nhadn't been rather cool, particularly at night, it would have been\ninsufferable.) Illinois is the most splendid agricultural country I ever\nsaw; the land is of surpassing richness; the place par excellence for\nfarmers. We stopt at various points along the canal, some of them pretty\nvillages.\n\nIt was 10 o'clock A.M. when we got in Chicago, too late for the steamer;\nso we went to an excellent public house, the \"American Temperance,\" and\nI spent the time that day and till next morning, looking around Chicago.\n\nAt 9 the next forenoon we started on the \"Griffith\" (on board of which I\nam now inditing these memoranda,) up the blue waters of Lake Michigan.\nI was delighted with the appearance of the towns along Wisconsin. At\nMilwaukee I went on shore, and walk'd around the place. They say the\ncountry back is beautiful and rich. (It seems to me that if we should\never remove from Long Island, Wisconsin would be the proper place to\ncome to.) The towns have a remarkable appearance of good living, without\nany penury or want. The country is so good naturally, and labor is in\nsuch demand.\n\nAbout 5 o'clock one afternoon I heard the cry of \"a woman over-board.\"\nIt proved to be a crazy lady, who had become so from the loss of her\nson a couple of weeks before. The small boat put off, and succeeded in\npicking her up, though she had been in the water 15 minutes. She was\ndead. Her husband was on board. They went off at the next stopping\nplace. While she lay in the water she probably recover'd her reason, as\nshe toss'd up her arms and lifted her face toward the boat.\n\n_Sunday Morning, June 11_.--We pass'd down Lake Huron yesterday and last\nnight, and between 4 and 5 o'clock this morning we ran on the \"flats,\"\nand have been vainly trying, with the aid of a steam tug and a lumbering\nlighter, to get clear again. The day is beautiful and the water clear\nand calm. Night before last we stopt at Mackinaw, (the island and\ntown,) and I went up on the old fort, one of the oldest stations in\nthe Northwest. We expect to get to Buffalo by to-morrow. The tug has\nfasten'd lines to us, but some have been snapt and the others have no\neffect. We seem to be firmly imbedded in the sand. (With the exception\nof a larger boat and better accommodations, it amounts to about the\nsame thing as a becalmment I underwent on the Montauk voyage, East\nLong Island, last summer.) _Later_.--We are off again--expect to reach\nDetroit before dinner.\n\nWe did not stop at Detroit. We are now on Lake Erie, jogging along at\na good round pace. A couple of hours since we were on the river above.\nDetroit seem'd to me a pretty place and thrifty. I especially liked\nthe looks of the Canadian shore opposite and of the little village\nof Windsor, and, indeed, all along the banks of the river. From the\nshrubbery and the neat appearance of some of the cottages, I think it\nmust have been settled by the French. While I now write we can see a\nlittle distance ahead the scene of the battle between Perry's fleet and\nthe British during the last war with England. The lake looks to me a\nfine sheet of water. We are having a beautiful day.\n\n_June 12_.--We stopt last evening at Cleveland, and though it was dark,\nI took the opportunity of rambling about the place; went up in the heart\nof the city and back to what appear'd to be the courthouse. The streets\nare unusually wide, and the buildings appear to be substantial and\ncomfortable. We went down through Main street and found, some distance\nalong, several squares of ground very prettily planted with trees and\nlooking attractive enough. Return'd to the boat by way of the lighthouse\non the hill.\n\nThis morning we are making for Buffalo, being, I imagine, a little more\nthan half across Lake Erie. The water is rougher than on Michigan or\nHuron. (On St. Clair it was smooth as glass.) The day is bright and dry,\nwith a stiff head wind.\n\nWe arriv'd in Buffalo on Monday evening; spent that night and a portion\nof next day going round the city exploring. Then got in the cars and\nwent to Niagara; went under the falls--saw the whirlpool and all the\nother sights.\n\nTuesday night started for Albany; travel'd all night. From the time\ndaylight afforded us a view of the country all seem'd very rich and well\ncultivated. Every few miles were large towns or villages.\n\nWednesday late we arriv'd at Albany. Spent the evening in exploring.\nThere was a political meeting (Hunker) at the capitol, but I pass'd\nit by. Next morning I started down the Hudson in the \"Alida;\" arriv'd\nsafely in New York that evening.\n\n_From the New Orleans Picayune, Jan. 25, 1887._\n\n\n\n\nSMALL MEMORANDA\n\n_Thousands lost--here one or two preserv'd_\n\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, _Washington, Aug. 22, 1865_.--As I write\nthis, about noon, the suite of rooms here is fill'd with Southerners,\nstanding in squads, or streaming in and out, some talking with\nthe Pardon Clerk, some waiting to see the Attorney General, others\ndiscussing in low tones among themselves. All are mainly anxious about\ntheir pardons. The famous 13th exception of the President's Amnesty\nProclamation of ----, makes it necessary that every secessionist, whose\nproperty is worth $20,000 or over, shall get a special pardon, before he\ncan transact any legal purchase, sale, &c. So hundreds and thousands of\nsuch property owners have either sent up here, for the last two months,\nor have been, or are now coming personally here, to get their pardons.\nThey are from Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South\nCarolina, and every Southern State. Some of their written petitions are\nvery abject. Secession officers of the rank of Brigadier General, or\nhigher, also need these special pardons. They also come here. I see\nstreams of the $20,000 men, (and some women,) every day. I talk now and\nthen with them, and learn much that is interesting and significant. All\nthe southern women that come (some splendid specimens, mothers, &c.) are\ndress'd in deep black.\n\nImmense numbers (several thousands) of these pardons have been pass'd\nupon favorably; the Pardon Warrants (like great deeds) have been issued\nfrom the State Department, on the requisition of this office. But for\nsome reason or other, they nearly all yet lie awaiting the President's\nsignature. He seems to be in no hurry about it, but lets them wait.\n\nThe crowds that come here make a curious study for me. I get along, very\nsociably, with any of them--as I let them do all the talking; only now\nand then I have a long confab, or ask a suggestive question or two.\n\nIf the thing continues as at present, the property and wealth of the\nSouthern States is going to legally rest, for the future, on these\npardons. Every single one is made out with the condition that the\ngrantee shall respect the abolition of slavery, and never make an\nattempt to restore it.\n\n_Washington, Sept. 8, 9, &c., 1865_.--The arrivals, swarms, &c., of the\n$20,000 men seeking pardons, still continue with increas'd numbers and\npertinacity. I yesterday (I am a clerk in the U. S. Attorney General's\noffice here) made out a long list from Alabama, nearly 200, recommended\nfor pardon by the Provisional Governor. This list, in the shape of a\nrequisition from the Attorney General, goes to the State Department.\nThere the Pardon Warrants are made out, brought back here, and then sent\nto the President, where they await his signature. He is signing them\nvery freely of late.\n\nThe President, indeed, as at present appears, has fix'd his mind on a\nvery generous and forgiving course toward the return'd secessionists.\nHe will not countenance at all the demand of the extreme Philo-African\nelement of the North, to make the right of negro voting at elections a\ncondition and sine qua non of the reconstruction of the United States\nsouth, and of their resumption of co-equality in the Union.\n\n\nA GLINT INSIDE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S CABINET APPOINTMENTS. ONE ITEM OF\nMANY.\n\nWhile it was hanging in suspense who should be appointed Secretary of\nthe Interior, (to take the place of Caleb Smith,) the choice was very\nclose between Mr. Harlan and Col. Jesse K. Dubois, of Illinois. The\nlatter had many friends. He was competent, he was honest, and he was a\nman. Mr. Harlan, in the race, finally gain'd the Methodist interest, and\ngot himself to be consider'd as identified with it; and his appointment\nwas apparently ask'd for by that powerful body. Bishop Simpson, of\nPhiladephia, came on and spoke for the selection. The President was\nmuch perplex'd. The reasons for appointing Col. Dubois were very strong,\nalmost insuperable--yet the argument for Mr. Harlan, under the adroit\nposition he had plac'd himself, was heavy. Those who press'd him adduc'd\nthe magnitude of the Methodists as a body, their loyalty, more general\nand genuine than any other sect--that they represented the West, and\nhad a right to be heard--that all or nearly all the other great\ndenominations had their representatives in the heads of the\ngovernment--that they as a body and the great sectarian power of the\nWest, formally ask'd Mr. Harlan's appointment--that he was of them,\nhaving been a Methodist minister--that it would not do to offend them,\nbut was highly necessary to propitiate them.\n\nMr. Lincoln thought deeply over the whole matter. He was in more than\nusual tribulation on the subject. Let it be enough to say that though\nMr. Harlan finally receiv'd the Secretaryship, Col. Dubois came as near\nbeing appointed as a man could, and not be. The decision was finally\nmade one night about 10 o'clock. Bishop Simpson and other clergymen\nand leading persons in Mr. Harlan's behalf, had been talking long and\nvehemently with the President. A member of Congress who was pressing\nCol. Dubois's claims, was in waiting. The President had told the Bishop\nthat he would make a decision that evening, and that he thought it\nunnecessary to be press'd any more on the subject. That night he call'd\nin the M.C. above alluded to, and said to him: \"Tell Uncle Jesse that\nI want to give him this appointment, and yet I cannot. I will do almost\nanything else in the world for him I am able. I have thought the matter\nall over, and under the circumstances think the Methodists too good and\ntoo great a body to be slighted. They have stood by the government, and\nhelp'd us their very best. I have had no better friends; and as the case\nstands, I have decided to appoint Mr. Harlan.\"\n\n\nNOTE TO A FRIEND\n\n[_Written on the fly-leaf of a copy of_ Specimen Days, _sent to Peter\nDoyle, at Washington, June, 1883_]\n\nPete, do you remember--(of course you do--I do well)--those great long\njovial walks we had at times for years, (1866-'72) out of Washington\ncity--often moonlight nights--'way to \"Good Hope\";--or, Sundays, up and\ndown the Potomac shores, one side or the other, sometimes ten miles at\na stretch? Or when you work'd on the horse-cars, and I waited for you,\ncoming home late together--or resting and chatting at the Market, corner\n7th street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk or watermelons?\nOr during my tedious sickness and first paralysis ('73) how you used to\ncome to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven me,\nand chat for an hour or so--or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr.\nDrinkard had order'd for me--before you went on duty?... Give my love\nto dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash, and tell them I have not forgotten them, and\nnever will.\n\nW.W.\n\n\nWRITTEN IMPROMPTU IN AN ALBUM\n\n_Germantown, Phila., Dec. 26, '83_. In memory of these merry Christmas\ndays and nights--to my friends Mr. and Mrs. Williams, Churchie, May,\nGurney, and little Aubrey.... A heavy snow-storm blocking up everything,\nand keeping us in. But souls, hearts, thoughts, unloos'd. And so--one\nand all, little and big--hav'n't we had a good time?\n\nW.W.\n\n\nTHE PLACE GRATITUDE FILLS IN A FINE CHARACTER\n\n_From the Philadelphia Press, Nov. 27, 1884, (Thanksgiving number)_\n\n_Scene_.--A large family supper party, a night or two ago, with voices\nand laughter of the young, mellow faces of the old, and a by-and-by\npause in the general joviality. \"Now, Mr. Whitman,\" spoke up one of the\ngirls, \"what have you to say about Thanksgiving? Won't you give us a\nsermon in advance, to sober us down?\" The sage nodded smilingly, look'd\na moment at the blaze of the great wood fire, ran his forefinger right\nand left through the heavy white mustache that might have otherwise\nimpeded his voice, and began: \"Thanksgiving goes probably far deeper\nthan you folks suppose. I am not sure but it is the source of the\nhighest poetry--as in parts of the Bible. Ruskin, indeed, makes the\ncentral source of all great art to be praise (gratitude) to the Almighty\nfor life, and the universe with its objects and play of action.\n\n\"We Americans devote an official day to it every year; yet I sometimes\nfear the real article is almost dead or dying in our self-sufficient,\nindependent Republic. Gratitude, anyhow, has never been made half enough\nof by the moralists; it is indispensable to a complete character, man's\nor woman's--the disposition to be appreciative, thankful. That is the\nmain matter, the element, inclination--what geologists call the _trend_.\nOf my own life and writings I estimate the giving thanks part, with what\nit infers, as essentially the best item. I should say the quality of\ngratitude rounds the whole emotional nature; I should say love and faith\nwould quite lack vitality without it. There are people--shall I call\nthem even religious people, as things go?--who have no such trend to\ntheir disposition.\"\n\n\n\n\nLAST OF THE WAR CASES\n\n_Memorandized at the time, Washington, 1865-'66_\n\n\n[Of reminiscences of the secession war, after the rest is said, I have\nthought it remains to give a few special words--in some respects at the\ntime the typical words of all, and most definite-of the samples of the\nkill'd and wounded in action, and of soldiers who linger'd afterward,\nfrom these wounds, or were laid up by obstinate disease or prostration.\nThe general statistics have been printed already, but can bear to be\nbriefly stated again. There were over 3,000,000 men (for all periods of\nenlistment, large and small) furnish'd to the Union army during the war,\nNew York State furnishing over 500,000, which was the greatest number\nof any one State. The losses by disease, wounds, kill'd in action,\naccidents, &c., were altogether about 600,000, or approximating to that\nnumber. Over 4,000,000 cases were treated in the main and adjudicatory\narmy hospitals. The number sounds strange, but it is true. More than\ntwo-thirds of the deaths were from prostration or disease. To-day\nthere lie buried over 300,000 soldiers in the various National army\nCemeteries, more than half of them (and that is really the most\nsignificant and eloquent bequest of the war) mark'd \"unknown.\" In full\nmortuary statistics of the war, the greatest deficiency arises from\nour not having the rolls, even as far as they were kept, of most of the\nSouthern military prisons--a gap which probably both adds to, and helps\nconceal, the indescribable horrors of those places; it is, however,\n(restricting one vivid point only) certain that over 30,000 Union\nsoldiers died, largely of actual starvation, in them. And now, leaving\nall figures and their \"sum totals,\" I feel sure a few genuine memoranda\nof such things--some cases jotted down '64, '65, and '66--made at the\ntime and on the spot, with all the associations of those scenes and\nplaces brought back, will not only go directest to the right spot, but\ngive a clearer and more actual sight of that period, than anything else.\nBefore I give the last cases I begin with verbatim extracts from letters\nhome to my mother in Brooklyn, the second year of the war.--W.W.]\n\n_Washington, Oct. 13, 1863_.--There has been a new lot of wounded and\nsick arriving for the last three days. The first and second days, long\nstrings of ambulances with the sick. Yesterday the worst, many with bad\nand bloody wounds, inevitably long neglected. I thought I was cooler and\nmore used to it, but the sight of some cases brought tears into my eyes.\nI had the luck yesterday, however, to do lots of good. Had provided many\nnourishing articles for the men for another quarter, but, fortunately,\nhad my stores where I could use them at once for these new-comers, as\nthey arrived, faint, hungry, fagg'd out from their journey, with soil'd\nclothes, and all bloody. I distributed these articles, gave partly to\nthe nurses I knew, or to those in charge. As many as possible I fed\nmyself. Then I found a lot of oyster soup handy, and bought it all at\nonce.\n\nIt is the most pitiful sight, this, when the men are first brought in,\nfrom some camp hospital broke up, or a part of the army moving. These\nwho arrived yesterday are cavalry men. Our troops had fought like\ndevils, but got the worst of it. They were Kilpatrick's cavalry; were\nin the rear, part of Meade's retreat, and the reb cavalry, knowing the\nground and taking a favorable opportunity, dash'd in between, cut them\noff, and shell'd them terribly. But Kilpatrick turn'd and brought them\nout mostly. It was last Sunday. (One of the most terrible sights and\ntasks is of such receptions.)\n\n_Oct. 27, 1863_.--If any of the soldiers I know (or their parents\nor folks) should call upon you--as they are often anxious to have my\naddress in Brooklyn--you just use them as you know how, and if you\nhappen to have pot-luck, and feel to ask them to take a bite, don't be\nafraid to do so. I have a friend, Thomas Neat, 2d N.Y. Cavalry, wounded\nin leg, now home in Jamaica, on furlough; he will probably call. Then\npossibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks, from western New York: he\nhad a son died here, and I was with the boy a good deal. The old man and\nhis wife have written me and ask'd me my Brooklyn address; he said he\nhad children in New York, and was occasionally down there. (When I come\nhome I will show you some of the letters I get from mothers, sisters,\nfathers, &c. They will make you cry.)\n\nHow the time passes away! To think it is over a year since I left\nhome suddenly--and have mostly been down in front since. The year has\nvanish'd swiftly, and oh, what scenes I have witness'd during that time!\nAnd the war is not settled yet; and one does not see anything certain,\nor even promising, of a settlement. But I do not lose the solid feeling,\nin myself, that the Union triumph is assured, whether it be sooner or\nwhether it be later, or whatever roundabout way we may be led there;\nand I find I don't change that conviction from any reverses we meet, nor\ndelays, nor blunders. One realizes here in Washington the great labors,\neven the negative ones, of Lincoln; that it is a big thing to have just\nkept the United States from being thrown down and having its throat cut.\nI have not waver'd or had any doubt of the issue, since Gettysburg.\n\n_8th September, '63_.--Here, now, is a specimen army hospital case:\nLorenzo Strong, Co. A, 9th United States Cavalry, shot by a shell last\nSunday; right leg amputated on the field. Sent up here Monday night,\n14th. Seem'd to be doing pretty well till Wednesday noon, 16th, when he\ntook a turn for the worse, and a strangely rapid and fatal termination\nensued. Though I had much to do, I staid and saw all. It was a\ndeath-picture characteristic of these soldiers' hospitals--the perfect\nspecimen of physique, one of the most magnificent I ever saw--the\nconvulsive spasms and working of muscles, mouth, and throat. There are\ntwo good women nurses, one on each side. The doctor comes in and gives\nhim a little chloroform. One of the nurses constantly fans him, for\nit is fearfully hot. He asks to be rais'd up, and they put him in a\nhalf-sitting posture. He call'd for \"Mark\" repeatedly, half-deliriously,\nall day. Life ebbs, runs now with the speed of a mill race; his splendid\nneck, as it lays all open, works still, slightly; his eyes turn back.\nA religious person coming in offers a prayer, in subdued tones, bent at\nthe foot of the bed; and in the space of the aisle, a crowd, including\ntwo or three doctors, several students, and many soldiers, has silently\ngather'd. It is very still and warm, as the struggle goes on, and\ndwindles, a little more, and a little more--and then welcome oblivion,\npainlessness, death. A pause, the crowd drops away, a white bandage is\nbound around and under the jaw, the propping pillows are removed, the\nlimpsy head falls down, the arms are softly placed by the side,\nall composed, all still,--and the broad white sheet is thrown over\neverything.\n\n_April 10, 1864_.--Unusual agitation all around concentrated here.\nExciting times in Congress. The Copperheads are getting furious, and\nwant to recognize the Southern Confederacy. \"This is a pretty time to\ntalk of recognizing such--,\" said a Pennsylvania officer in hospital to\nme to-day, \"after what has transpired the last three years.\" After first\nFredericksburg I felt discouraged myself, and doubted whether our rulers\ncould carry on the war. But that has pass'd away. The war _must_ be\ncarried on. I would willingly go in the ranks myself if I thought it\nwould profit more than as at present, and I don't know sometimes but I\nshall, as it is. Then there is certainly a strange, deep, fervid feeling\nform'd or arous'd in the land, hard to describe or name; it is not a\nmajority feeling, but it will make itself felt. M., you don't know what\na nature a fellow gets, not only after being a soldier a while, but\nafter living in the sights and influences of the camps, the wounded,\n&c.--a nature he never experienced before. The stars and stripes, the\ntune of Yankee Doodle, and similar things, produce such an effect on\na fellow as never before. I have seen them bring tears on some men's\ncheeks, and others turn pale with emotion. I have a little flag (it\nbelong'd to one of our cavalry regiments,) presented to me by one of the\nwounded; it was taken by the secesh in a fight, and rescued by our men\nin a bloody skirmish following. It cost three men's lives to get back\nthat four-by-three flag--to tear it from the breast of a dead rebel--for\n_the name_ of getting their little \"rag\" back again. The man that\nsecured it was very badly wounded, and they let him keep it. I was with\nhim a good deal; he wanted to give me some keepsake, he said,--he didn't\nexpect to live,--so he gave me that flag. The best of it all is, dear\nM., there isn't a regiment, cavalry or infantry, that wouldn't do the\nlike, on the like occasion.\n\n_April 12_.--I will finish my letter this morning; it is a beautiful\nday. I was up in Congress very late last night. The House had a very\nexcited night session about expelling the men that proposed recognizing\nthe Southern Confederacy. You ought to hear (as I do) the soldiers talk;\nthey are excited to madness. We shall probably have hot times here, not\nin the military fields alone. The body of the army is true and firm as\nthe North Star.\n\n_May 6, '64_.--M., the poor soldier with diarrhoea, is still living,\nbut, oh, what a looking object! Death would be a relief to him--he\ncannot last many hours. Cunningham, the Ohio soldier, with leg amputated\nat thigh, has pick'd up beyond expectation; now looks indeed like\ngetting well. (He died a few weeks afterwards.) The hospitals are very\nfull. I am very well indeed. Hot here to-day.\n\n_May 23, '64_.--Sometimes I think that should it come when it _must_,\nto fall in battle, one's anguish over a son or brother kill'd might be\ntemper'd with much to take the edge off. Lingering and extreme suffering\nfrom wounds or sickness seem to me far worse than death in battle. I\ncan honestly say the latter has no terrors for me, as far as I myself am\nconcern'd. Then I should say, too, about death in war, that our feelings\nand imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter. Of\nthe many I have seen die, or known of, the past year, I have not seen or\nknown one who met death with terror. In most cases I should say it was\na welcome relief and release. Yesterday I spent a good part of the\nafternoon with a young soldier of seventeen, Charles Cutter, of Lawrence\ncity, Massachusetts, 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, Battery M. He\nwas brought to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen. Well,\nI thought to myself, as I sat looking at him, it ought to be a relief to\nhis folks if they could see how little he really suffer'd. He lay very\nplacid, in a half lethargy, with his eyes closed. As it was extremely\nhot, and I sat a good while silently fanning him, and wiping the\nsweat, at length he open'd his eyes quite wide and clear, and look'd\ninquiringly around. I said, \"What is it, my boy? Do you want anything?\"\nHe answer'd quietly, with a good-natured smile, \"Oh, nothing; I was only\nlooking around to see who was with me.\" His mind was somewhat wandering,\nyet he lay in an evident peacefulness that sanity and health might\nhave envied. I had to leave for other engagements. He died, I heard\nafterward, without any special agitation, in the course of the night.\n\n_Washington, May 26, '63_.--M., I think something of commencing a series\nof lectures, readings, talks, &c., through the cities of the North, to\nsupply myself with funds for hospital ministrations. I do not like to\nbe so beholden to others; I need a pretty free supply of money, and the\nwork grows upon me, and fascinates me. It is the most magnetic as well\nas terrible sight: the lots of poor wounded and helpless men depending\nso much, in one ward or another, upon my soothing or talking to them,\nor rousing them up a little, or perhaps petting, or feeding them their\ndinner or supper (here is a patient, for instance, wounded in both\narms,) or giving some trifle for a novelty or change--anything, however\ntrivial, to break the monotony of those hospital hours.\n\nIt is curious: when I am present at the most appalling scenes, deaths,\noperations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots,) I keep cool and\ndo not give out or budge, although my sympathies are very much excited;\nbut often, hours afterward, perhaps when I am home, or out walking\nalone, I feel sick, and actually tremble, when I recall the case again\nbefore me.\n\n_Sunday afternoon, opening of 1865_.--Pass'd this afternoon among a\ncollection of unusually bad cases, wounded and sick secession soldiers,\nleft upon our hands. I spent the previous Sunday afternoon there also.\nAt that time two were dying. Two others have died during the week.\nSeveral of them are partly deranged. I went around among them\nelaborately. Poor boys, they all needed to be cheer'd up. As I sat down\nby any particular one, the eyes of all the rest in the neighboring cots\nwould fix upon me, and remain steadily riveted as long as I sat within\ntheir sight. Nobody seem'd to wish anything special to eat or drink.\nThe main thing ask'd for was postage stamps, and paper for writing. I\ndistributed all the stamps I had. Tobacco was wanted by some.\n\nOne call'd me over to him and ask'd me in a low tone what denomination\nI belong'd to. He said he was a Catholic--wish'd to find some one of the\nsame faith--wanted some good reading. I gave him something to read, and\nsat down by him a few minutes. Moved around with a word for each. They\nwere hardly any of them personally attractive cases, and no visitors\ncome here. Of course they were all destitute of money. I gave small sums\nto two or three, apparently the most needy. The men are from quite all\nthe Southern States, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, &c.\n\nWrote several letters. One for a young fellow named Thomas J. Byrd, with\na bad wound and diarrhoea. Was from Russell county, Alabama; been out\nfour years. Wrote to his mother; had neither heard from her nor written\nto her in nine months. Was taken prisoner last Christmas, in Tennessee;\nsent to Nashville, then to Camp Chase, Ohio, and kept there a long time;\nall the while not money enough to get paper and postage stamps. Was\nparoled, but on his way home the wound took gangrene; had diarrhoea\nalso; had evidently been very low. Demeanor cool, and patient. A\ndark-skinn'd, quaint young fellow, with strong Southern idiom; no\neducation.\n\nAnother letter for John W. Morgan, aged 18, from Shellot, Brunswick\ncounty, North Carolina; been out nine months; gunshot wound in right\nleg, above knee; also diarrhoea; wound getting along well; quite a\ngentle, affectionate boy; wish'd me to put in the letter for his mother\nto kiss his little brother and sister for him. [I put strong envelopes\non these, and two or three other letters, directed them plainly and\nfully, and dropt them in the Washington post-office the next morning\nmyself.]\n\nThe large ward I am in is used for secession soldiers exclusively. One\nman, about forty years of age, emaciated with diarrhoea, I was attracted\nto, as he lay with his eyes turn'd up, looking like death. His weakness\nwas so extreme that it took a minute or so, every time, for him to talk\nwith anything like consecutive meaning; yet he was evidently a man of\ngood intelligence and education. As I said anything, he would lie a\nmoment perfectly still, then, with closed eyes, answer in a low, very\nslow voice, quite correct and sensible, but in a way and tone that wrung\nmy heart. He had a mother, wife, and child living (or probably living)\nin his home in Mississippi. It was long, long since he had seen them.\nHad he caus'd a letter to be sent them since he got here in Washington?\nNo answer. I repeated the question, very slowly and soothingly. He could\nnot tell whether he had or not--things of late seem'd to him like a\ndream. After waiting a moment, I said: \"Well, I am going to walk down\nthe ward a moment, and when I come back you can tell me. If you have not\nwritten, I will sit down and write.\" A few minutes after I return'd; he\nsaid he remember'd now that some one had written for him two or three\ndays before. The presence of this man impress'd me profoundly. The\nflesh was all sunken on face and arms; the eyes low in their sockets\nand glassy, and with purple rings around them. Two or three great tears\nsilently flow'd out from the eyes, and roll'd down his temples (he was\ndoubtless unused to be spoken to as I was speaking to him.)Sickness,\nimprisonment, exhaustion, &c., had conquer'd the body, yet the mind held\nmastery still, and call'd even wandering remembrance back.\n\nThere are some fifty Southern soldiers here; all sad, sad cases. There\nis a good deal of scurvy. I distributed some paper, envelopes, and\npostage stamps, and wrote addresses full and plain on many of the\nenvelopes.\n\nI return'd again Tuesday, August 1, and moved around in the same manner\na couple of hours.\n\n_September 22, '65_.--Afternoon and evening at Douglas hospital to see\na friend belonging to 2d New York Artillery (Hiram W. Frazee, Serg't,)\ndown with an obstinate compound fracture of left leg receiv'd in one of\nthe last battles near Petersburg. After sitting a while with him,\nwent through several neighboring wards. In one of them found an old\nacquaintance transferr'd here lately, a rebel prisoner, in a dying\ncondition. Poor fellow, the look was already on his face. He gazed long\nat me. I ask'd him if he knew me. After a moment he utter'd something,\nbut inarticulately. I have seen him off and on for the last five months.\nHe has suffer'd very much; a bad wound in left leg, severely fractured,\nseveral operations, cuttings, extractions of bone, splinters, &c. I\nremember he seem'd to me, as I used to talk with him, a fair specimen of\nthe main strata of the Southerners, those without property or education,\nbut still with the stamp which comes from freedom and equality. I liked\nhim; Jonathan Wallace, of Hurd co., Georgia, age 30 (wife, Susan F.\nWallace, Houston, Hurd co., Georgia.) [If any good soul of that county\nshould see this, I hope he will send her this word.] Had a family; had\nnot heard from them since taken prisoner, now six months. I had written\nfor him, and done trifles for him, before he came here. He made no\noutward show, was mild in his talk and behavior, but I knew he worried\nmuch inwardly. But now all would be over very soon. I half sat upon the\nlittle stand near the head of the bed. Wallace was somewhat restless.\nI placed my hand lightly on his forehead and face, just sliding it over\nthe surface. In a moment or so he fell into a calm, regular-breathing\nlethargy or sleep, and remain'd so while I sat there. It was dark, and\nthe lights were lit. I hardly know why (death seem'd hovering near,) but\nI stay'd nearly an hour. A Sister of Charity, dress'd in black, with\na broad white linen bandage around her head and under her chin, and a\nblack crape over all and flowing down from her head in long wide pieces,\ncame to him, and moved around the bed. She bow'd low and solemn to me.\nFor some time she moved around there noiseless as a ghost, doing little\nthings for the dying man.\n\n_December, '65_.--The only remaining hospital is now \"Harewood,\" out in\nthe woods, northwest of the city. I have been visiting there regularly\nevery Sunday during these two months.\n\n_January 24, '66_.--Went out to Harewood early to-day, and remain'd all\nday.\n\n_Sunday, February 4, 1866_.--Harewood Hospital again. Walk'd out this\nafternoon (bright, dry, ground frozen hard) through the woods. Ward 6 is\nfill'd with blacks, some with wounds, some ill, two or three with limbs\nfrozen. The boys made quite a picture sitting round the stove. Hardly\nany can read or write. I write for three or four, direct envelopes, give\nsome tobacco, &c.\n\nJoseph Winder, a likely boy, aged twenty-three, belongs to 10th Color'd\nInfantry (now in Texas;) is from Eastville, Virginia. Was a slave;\nbelong'd to Lafayette Homeston. The master was quite willing he should\nleave. Join'd the army two years ago; has been in one or two battles.\nWas sent to hospital with rheumatism. Has since been employ'd as cook.\nHis parents at Eastville; he gets letters from them, and has letters\nwritten to them by a friend. Many black boys left that part of Virginia\nand join'd the army; the 10th, in fact, was made up of Virginia blacks\nfrom thereabouts. As soon as discharged is going back to Eastville to\nhis parents and home, and intends to stay there.\n\nThomas King, formerly 2d District Color'd Regiment, discharged soldier,\nCompany E, lay in a dying condition; his disease was consumption. A\nCatholic priest was administering extreme unction to him. (I have\nseen this kind of sight several times in the hospitals; it is very\nimpressive.)\n\n_Harewood, April 29, 1866. Sunday afternoon_.--Poor Joseph Swiers,\nCompany H, 155th Pennsylvania, a mere lad (only eighteen years of age;)\nhis folks living in Reedsburgh, Pennsylvania. I have known him for\nnearly a year, transferr'd from hospital to hospital. He was badly\nwounded in the thigh at Hatcher's Run, February 6, '65.\n\nJames E. Ragan, Atlanta, Georgia; 2d United States Infantry. Union\nfolks. Brother impress'd, deserted, died; now no folks, left alone\nin the world, is in a singularly nervous state; came in hospital with\nintermittent fever.\n\nWalk slowly around the ward, observing, and to see if I can do anything.\nTwo or three are lying very low with consumption, cannot recover; some\nwith old wounds; one with both feet frozen off, so that on one only the\nheel remains. The supper is being given out: the liquid call'd tea, a\nthick slice of bread, and some stew'd apples.\n\nThat was about the last I saw of the regular army hospitals.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION Here is a portrait of E.H. from life, by Henry Inman, in\nNew York, about 1827 or '28. The painting was finely copper-plated\nin 1830, and the present is a fac simile. Looks as I saw him in the\nfollowing narrative.]\n\nThe time was signalized by the _separation_ of the society of Friends,\nso greatly talked of--and continuing yet--but so little really\nexplain'd. (All I give of this separation is in a Note following.)\n\n\n\n\nNotes (_such as they are) founded on_\n\nELIAS HICKS\n\n\n_Prefatory Note_--As myself a little boy hearing so much of E.H., at\nthat time, long ago, in Suffolk and Queens and Kings counties--and more\nthan once personally seeing the old man--and my dear, dear father and\nmother faithful listeners to him at the meetings--I remember how I\ndream'd to write perhaps a piece about E.H. and his look and discourses,\nhowever long afterward--for my parents' sake--and the dear Friends\ntoo! And the following is what has at last but all come out of it--the\nfeeling and intention never forgotten yet!\n\nThere is a sort of nature of persons I have compared to little rills of\nwater, fresh, from perennial springs--(and the comparison is indeed an\nappropriate one)--persons not so very plenty, yet some few certainly\nof them running over the surface and area of humanity, all times, all\nlands. It is a specimen of this class I would now present. I would sum\nup in E.H., and make his case stand for the class, the sort, in all\nages, all lands, sparse, not numerous, yet enough to irrigate the\nsoil--enough to prove the inherent moral stock and irrepressible\ndevotional aspirations growing indigenously of themselves, always\nadvancing, and never utterly gone under or lost.\n\nAlways E.H. gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked\ntheology, all religion, all worship, all the truth to which you are\npossibly eligible--namely in _yourself_ and your inherent relations.\nOthers talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious\natonements--the canons outside of yourself and apart from man--E.H. to\nthe religion inside of man's very own nature. This he incessantly labors\nto kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen. He is the\nmost _democratic_ of the religionists--the prophets.\n\nI have no doubt that both the curious fate and death of his four sons,\nand the facts (and dwelling on them) of George Fox's strange early life,\nand permanent \"conversion,\" had much to do with the peculiar and\nsombre ministry and style of E.H. from the first, and confirmed him all\nthrough. One must not be dominated by the man's almost absurd saturation\nin cut and dried biblical phraseology, and in ways, talk, and standard,\nregardful mainly of the one need he dwelt on, above all the rest. This\nmain need he drove home to the soul; the canting and sermonizing soon\nexhale away to any auditor that realizes what E.H. is for and after. The\npresent paper, (a broken memorandum of his formation, his earlier life,)\nis the cross-notch that rude wanderers make in the woods, to remind\nthem afterward of some matter of first-rate importance and full\ninvestigation. (Remember too, that E.H. was _a thorough believer in the\nHebrew Scriptures_, in his way.)\n\nThe following are really but disjointed fragments recall'd to serve and\neke out here the lank printed pages of what I commenc'd unwittingly two\nmonths ago. Now, as I am well in for it, comes an old attack, the sixth\nor seventh recurrence, of my war-paralysis, dulling me from putting the\nnotes in shape, and threatening any further action, head or body. _W.W.,\nCamden, N.J., July, 1888_.\n\nTo begin with, my theme is comparatively featureless. The great\nhistorian has pass'd by the life of Elias Hicks quite without glance or\ntouch. Yet a man might commence and overhaul it as furnishing one of the\namplest historic and biography's backgrounds. While the foremost actors\nand events from 1750 to 1830 both in Europe and America were crowding\neach other on the world's stage--While so many kings, queens, soldiers,\nphilosophs, musicians, voyagers, litterateurs, enter one side, cross the\nboards, and disappear--amid loudest reverberating names--Frederick\nthe Great, Swedenborg, Junius, Voltaire, Rousseau, Linnaeus,\nHerschel--curiously contemporary with the long life of Goethe--through\nthe occupancy of the British throne by George the Third--amid stupendous\nvisible political and social revolutions, and far more stupendous\ninvisible moral ones--while the many quarto volumes of the Encyclopaedia\nFrancaise are being published at fits and intervals, by Diderot, in\nParis--while Haydn and Beethoven and Mozart and Weber are working out\ntheir harmonic compositions--while Mrs. Siddons and Talma and Kean are\nacting--while Mungo Park explores Africa, and Capt. Cook circumnavigates\nthe globe--through all the fortunes of the American Revolution, the\nbeginning, continuation and end, the battle of Brooklyn, the surrender\nat Saratoga, the final peace of '83--through the lurid tempest of the\nFrench Revolution, the execution of the king and queen, and the Reign of\nTerror--through the whole of the meteor-career of Napoleon--through\nall Washington's, Adams's, Jefferson's, Madison's, and Monroe's\nPresidentiads--amid so many flashing lists of names, (indeed there seems\nhardly, in any department, any end to them, Old World or New,) Franklin,\nSir Joshua Reynolds, Mirabeau, Fox, Nelson, Paul Jones, Kant, Fichte,\nand Hegel, Fulton, Walter Scott, Byron, Mesmer, Champollion--Amid\npictures that dart upon me even as I speak, and glow and mix and\ncoruscate and fade like aurora boreales--Louis the 16th threaten'd by\nthe mob, the trial of Warren Hastings, the death-bed of Robert Burns,\nWellington at Waterloo, Decatur capturing the Macedonian, or the\nsea-fight between the Chesapeake and the Shannon--During all these\nwhiles,\n\nI say, and though on a far different grade, running parallel and\ncontemporary with all--a curious, quiet yet busy life centred in a\nlittle country village on Long Island, and within sound on still\nnights of the mystic surf-beat of the sea. About this life, this\nPersonality--neither soldier, nor scientist, nor litterateur--I propose\nto occupy a few minutes in fragmentary talk, to give some few melanges,\ndisconnected impressions, statistics, resultant groups, pictures,\nthoughts' of him, or radiating from him.\n\nElias Hicks was born March 19, 1748, in Hempstead township, Queens\ncounty, Long Island, New York State, near a village bearing the old\nScripture name of Jericho, (a mile or so north and east of the present\nHicksville, on the L.I. Railroad.) His father and mother were Friends,\nof that class working with their own hands, and mark'd by neither riches\nnor actual poverty. Elias as a child and youth had small education from\nletters, but largely learn'd from Nature's schooling. He grew up even in\nhis ladhood a thorough gunner and fisherman. The farm of his parents lay\non the south or sea-shore side of Long Island, (they had early removed\nfrom Jericho,) one of the best regions in the world for wild fowl and\nfor fishing. Elias became a good horseman, too, and knew the animal\nwell, riding races; also a singer fond of \"vain songs,\" as he afterwards\ncalls them; a dancer, too, at the country balls. When a boy of 13 he had\ngone to live with an elder brother; and when about 17 he changed again\nand went as apprentice to the carpenter's trade. The time of all this\nwas before the Revolutionary War, and the locality 30 to 40 miles from\nNew York city. My great-grandfather, Whitman, was often with Elias at\nthese periods, and at merry-makings and sleigh-rides in winter over \"the\nplains.\"\n\nHow well I remember the region--the flat plains of the middle of Long\nIsland, as then, with their prairie-like vistas and grassy patches in\nevery direction, and the 'kill-calf' and herds of cattle and sheep. Then\nthe South Bay and shores and the salt meadows, and the sedgy smell, and\nnumberless little bayous and hummock-islands in the waters, the habitat\nof every sort of fish and aquatic fowl of North America. And the bay\nmen--a strong, wild, peculiar race--now extinct, or rather entirely\nchanged. And the beach outside the sandy bars, sometimes many miles at\na stretch, with their old history of wrecks and storms--the weird,\nwhite-gray beach--not without its tales of pathos--tales, too,\nof grandest heroes and heroisms. In such scenes and elements and\ninfluences--in the midst of Nature and along the shores of the\nsea--Elias Hicks was fashion'd through boyhood and early manhood, to\nmaturity. But a moral and mental and emotional change was imminent.\nAlong at this time he says:\n\n  My apprenticeship being now expir'd, I gradually withdrew from\n  the company of my former associates, became more acquainted with\n  Friends, and was more frequent in my attendance of meetings; and\n  although this was in some degree profitable to me, yet I made but\n  slow progress in my religious improvement. The occupation of part of\n  my time in fishing and fowling had frequently tended to preser\n  me from falling into hurtful associations; but through the rising\n  intimations and reproofs of divine grace in my heart, I now began to\n  feel that the manner in which I sometimes amus'd myself with my gun\n  was not without sin; for although I mostly preferr'd going alone,\n  and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl,\n  mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations, that the\n  opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me; yet, on\n  other occasions, when accompanied by some of my acquaintances, and\n  when no fowls appear'd which would be useful to us after being\n  obtain'd, we sometimes, from wantonness or for mere diversion, would\n  destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us. This\n  cruel procedure affects my heart while penning these lines.\n\nIn his 23d year Elias was married, by the Friends' ceremony, to Jemima\nSeaman. His wife was an only child; the parents were well off for common\npeople, and at their request the son-in-law mov'd home with them and\ncarried on the farm--which at their decease became his own, and he liv'd\nthere all his remaining life. Of this matrimonial part of his career,\n(it continued, and with unusual happiness, for 58 years,) he says,\ngiving the account of his marriage:\n\n  On this important occasion, we felt the clear and consoling evidence\n  of divine truth, and it remain'd with us as a seal upon our spirits,\n  strengthening us mutually to bear, with becoming fortitude, the\n  vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot, and of which we h\n  a large share in passing through this probationary state. My wife,\n  although not of a very strong constitution, liv'd to be the mother\n  of eleven children, four sons and seven daughters. Our second\n  daughter, a very lovely, promising child, died when young, with the\n  small-pox, and the youngest was not living at its birth. The rest\n  all arriv'd to years of discretion, and afforded us considerable\n  comfort, as they prov'd to be in a good degree dutiful children. All\n  our sons, however, were of weak constitutions, and were not able to\n  take care of themselves, being so enfeebl'd as not to be able to\n  walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age. The two eldest died\n  in the fifteenth year of their age, the third in his seventeenth\n  year, and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died. But,\n  although thus helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the\n  resign'd cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments,\n  made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and\n  pleasant; and I trust we were preserv'd from murmuring or repining,\n  believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and according to the\n  will and gracious disposing of an all-wise providence, for purposes\n  best known to himself. And when I have observ'd the great anxiety\n  and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who\n  are favor'd with health, especially their sons, I could perceive\n  very few whose troubles and exercises, on that account, did not far\n  exceed ours. The weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to\n  keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations\n  the world; and we believ'd that in their death they were happy, and\n  admitted into the realms of peace and joy: a reflection, the most\n  comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their\n  tender offspring.\n\nOf a serious and reflective turn, by nature, and from his reading\nand surroundings, Elias had more than once markedly devotional inward\nintimations. These feelings increas'd in frequency and strength, until\nsoon the following:\n\n  About the twenty-sixth year of my age I was again brought, by the\n  operative influence of divine grace, under deep concern of mind; and\n  was led, through adorable mercy, to see, that although I had ceas'd\n  from many sins and vanities of my youth, yet there were many\n  remaining that I was still guilty of, which were not yet aton'd for,\n  and for which I now felt the judgments of God to rest upon m\n  This caus'd me to cry earnestly to the Most High for pardon and\n  redemption, and he graciously condescended to hear my cry, and to\n  open a way before me, wherein I must walk, in order to experience\n  reconciliation with him; and as I abode in watchfulness and deep\n  humiliation before him, light broke forth out of obscurity, and my\n  darkness became as the noon-day. I began to have openings leading to\n  the ministry, which brought me under close exercise and deep travail\n  of spirit; for although I had for some time spoken on subjects of\n  business in monthly and preparative meetings, yet the prospe\n  of opening my mouth in public meetings was a close trial; but I\n  endeavor'd to keep my mind quiet and resign' d to the heavenly call,\n  if it should be made clear to me to be my duty. Nevertheless,\n  I was, soon after, sitting in a meeting, in much weightiness of\n  spirit, a secret, though clear, intimation accompanied me to spe\n  a few words, which were then given to me to utter, yet fear so\n  prevail'd, that I did not yield to the intimation. For this\n  omission, I felt close rebuke, and judgment seem'd, for some time,\n  to cover my mind; but as I humbl'd myself under the Lord's mighty\n  hand, he again lifted up the light of his countenance upon me, and\n  enabl'd me to renew covenant with him, that if he would pass by this\n  my offence, I would, in future, be faithful, if he should again\n  require such a service of me.\n\nThe Revolutionary War following, tried the sect of Friends more than\nany. The difficulty was to steer between their convictions as patriots,\nand their pledges of non-warring peace. Here is the way they solv'd the\nproblem:\n\n  A war, with all its cruel and destructive effects, having raged for\n  several years between the British Colonies in North America and the\n  mother country, Friends, as well as others, were expos' d to many\n  severe trials and sufferings; yet, in the colony of New York,\n  Friends, who stood faithful to their principles, and did not meddle\n  in the controversy, had, after a short period at first, considerable\n  favor allow'd them. The yearly meeting was held steadily, duri\n  the war, on Long Island, where the king's party had the rule; yet\n  Friends from the Main, where the American army ruled, had free\n  passage through both armies to attend it, and any other meetings\n  they were desirous of attending, except in a few instances. This was\n  a favor which the parties would not grant to their best friends, who\n  were of a war-like disposition; which shows what great advantages\n  would redound to mankind, were they all of this pacific spirit. I\n  pass'd myself through the lines of both armies six times during the\n  war, without molestation, both parties generally receiving me with\n  openness and civility; and although I had to pass over a tract of\n  country, between the two armies, sometimes more than thirty miles in\n  extent, and which was much frequented by robbers, a set, in general,\n  of cruel, unprincipled banditti, issuing out from both partie\n  yet, excepting once, I met with no interruption even from the\n  But although Friends in general experienc'd many favors and\n  deliverances, yet those scenes of war and confusion occasion\n  many trials and provings in various ways to the faithful. One\n  circumstance I am willing to mention, as it caus'd me considerable\n  exercise and concern. There was a large cellar under the new\n  meeting-house belonging to Friends in New York, which was generally\n  let as a store. When the king's troops enter'd the city, they took\n  possession of it for the purpose of depositing their warlike stores;\n  and ascertaining what Friends had the care of letting it, their\n  commissary came forward and offer'd to pay the rent; and those\n  Friends, for want of due consideration, accepted it. This caus'd\n  great uneasiness to the concern'd part of the Society, who\n  apprehended it not consistent with our peaceable principles to\n  receive payment for the depositing of military stores in our houses.\n  The subject was brought before the yearly meeting in 1779, and\n  engag'd its careful attention; but those Friends, who had been\n  active in the reception of the money, and some few others, were not\n  willing to acknowledge their proceedings to be inconsistent, nor to\n  return the money to those from whom it was receiv'd; and in order to\n  justify themselves therein, they referr'd to the conduct of Friends\n  in Philadelphia in similar cases. Matters thus appearing very\n  difficult and embarrassing, it was unitedly concluded to refer the\n  final determination thereof to the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania;\n  and several Friends were appointed to attend that meeting in\n  relation thereto, among whom I was one of the number. We accordingly\n  set out on the 9th day of the 9th month, 1779, and I was accompanied\n  from home by my beloved friend John Willis, who was likewise on the\n  appointment. We took a solemn leave of our families, they feeling\n  much anxiety at parting with us, on account of the dangers we were\n  expos'd to, having to pass not only the lines of the two armies, but\n  the deserted and almost uninhabited country that lay between them,\n  in many places the grass being grown up in the streets, and many\n  houses desolate and empty. Believing it, however, my duty to proceed\n  in the service, my mind was so settled and trust-fix'd in the divine\n  arm of power, that faith seem'd to banish all fear, and cheerfulness\n  and quiet resignation were, I believe, my constant companions during\n  the journey. We got permission, with but little difficulty, to pass\n  the outguards of the king's army at Kingsbridge, and proceeded to\n  Westchester. We afterwards attended meetings at Harrison's Purchase,\n  and Oblong, having the concurrence of our monthly meeting to take\n  some meetings in our way, a concern leading thereto having for some\n  time previously attended my mind. We pass'd from thence to Nine\n  Partners, and attended their monthly meeting, and then turn'd our\n  faces towards Philadelphia, being join'd by several others of the\n  Committee. We attended New Marlborough, Hardwick, and Kingswood\n  meetings on our journey, and arriv'd at Philadelphia on the 7th day\n  of the week, and 25th of 9th month, on which day we attended the\n  yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders, which began at the eleventh\n  hour. I also attended all the sittings of the yearly meeting until\n  the 4th day of the next week, and was then so indispos'd with a\n  fever, which had been increasing on me for several days, that I was\n  not able to attend after that time. I was therefore not present when\n  the subject was discuss' d, which came from our yearly meeting but I\n  was inform'd by my companion, that it was a very solemn opportunity,\n  and the matter was resulted in advising that the money should be\n  return'd into the office from whence it was receiv'd, accompanied\n  with our reasons for so doing: and this was accordingly done by the\n  direction of our yearly meeting the next year.\n\nThen, season after season, when peace and Independence reign'd, year\nfollowing year, this remains to be (1791) a specimen of his personal\nlabors:\n\n  I was from home on this journey four months and eleven days; rode\n  about one thousand five hundred miles, and attended forty-nine\n  particular meetings among Friends, three quarterly meetings, six\n  monthly meetings, and forty meetings among other people.\n\nAnd again another experience:\n\n  In the forepart of this meeting, my mind was reduc'd into such a\n  state of great weakness and depression, that my faith was almost\n  ready to fail, which produc'd great searchings of heart, so that I\n  was led to call in question all that I had ever before experienc'd.\n  In this state of doubting, I was ready to wish myself at home, from\n  an apprehension that I should only expose myself to reproach, and\n  wound the cause I was embark'd in; for the heavens seem'd like\n  brass, and the earth as iron; such coldness and hardness, I thought,\n  could scarcely have ever been experienc'd before by any creature, so\n  great was the depth of my baptism at this time; nevertheless, as I\n  endeavor'd to quiet my mind, in this conflicting dispensation, and\n  be resign'd to my allotment, however distressing, towards the latter\n  part of the meeting a ray of light broke through the surrounding\n  darkness, in which the Shepherd of Israel was pleas'd to arise, and\n  by the light of his glorious countenance, to scatter those clouds of\n  opposition. Then ability was receiv'd, and utterance given, to speak\n  of his marvellous works in the redemption of souls, and to op\n  the way of life and salvation, and the mysteries of his glorious\n  kingdom, which are hid from the wise and prudent of this world, and\n  reveal'd only unto those who are reduc'd into the state of little\n  children and babes in Christ.\n\nAnd concluding another jaunt in 1794:\n\n  I was from home in this journey about five months, and travell\n  by land and water about two thousand two hundred and eighty-three\n  miles; having visited all the meetings of Friends in the New England\n  states, and many meetings amongst those of other professions; and\n  also visited many meetings, among Friends and others, in the upper\n  part of our own yearly meeting; and found real peace in my labors.\n\nAnother 'tramp' in 1798:\n\n  I was absent from home in this journey about five months and two\n  weeks, and rode about sixteen hundred miles, and attended about one\n  hundred and forty-three meetings.\n\nHere are some memoranda of 1813, near home:\n\n  First day. Our meeting this day pass'd in silent labor. The cloud\n  rested on the tabernacle; and, although it was a day of much rain\n  outwardly, yet very little of the dew of Hermon appear'd to distil\n  among us. Nevertheless, a comfortable calm was witness'd towards the\n  close, which we must render to the account of unmerited mercy and\n  love.\n\n  Second day. Most of this day was occupied in a visit to a sick\n  friend, who appeared comforted therewith. Spent part of the evening\n  in reading part of Paul's Epistle to the Romans.\n\n  Third day. I was busied most of this day in my common vocations.\n  Spent the evening principally in reading Paul. Found considerable\n  satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians; in which he\n  shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who\n  were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth,\n  without looking through and beyond the instrument, to the great\n  first cause and Author of every blessing, to whom all the praise and\n  honor are due.\n\n  Fifth day, 1st of 4th month. At our meeting to-day found it, as\n  usual, a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center'\n  where it ought to be. What a multitude of intruding thoughts\n  imperceptibly, as it were, steal into the mind, and turn it from its\n  proper object, whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against\n  them. Felt a little strength, just at the close, to remind Friends\n  of the necessity of a steady perseverance, by a recapitulation of\n  the parable of the unjust judge, showing how men ought always to\n  pray, and not to faint.\n\n  Sixth day. Nothing material occurr'd, but a fear lest the cares of\n  the world should engross too much of my time.\n\n  Seventh day. Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends, which\n  I have long lov'd. The rest of the day I employ'd in manual labor,\n  mostly in gardening.\n\nBut we find if we attend to records and details, we shall lay out an\nendless task. We can briefly say, summarily, that his whole life was\na long religious missionary life of method, practicality, sincerity,\nearnestness, and pure piety--as near to his time here, as one in Judea,\nfar back--or in any life, any age. The reader who feels interested must\nget--with all its dryness and mere dates, absence of emotionality\nor literary quality, and whatever abstract attraction (with even a\nsuspicion of cant, sniffling,) the \"Journal of the Life and Religious\nLabours of Elias Hicks, written by himself,\" at some Quaker book-store.\n(It is from this headquarters I have extracted the preceding\nquotations.) During E. H.'s matured life, continued from fifty to sixty\nyears--while working steadily, earning his living and paying his way\nwithout intermission--he makes, as previously memorandized, several\nhundred preaching visits, not only through Long Island, but some of them\naway into the Middle or Southern States, or north into Canada, or the\nthen far West--extending to thousands of miles, or filling several weeks\nand sometimes months. These religious journeys--scrupulously accepting\nin payment only his transportation from place to place, with his own\nfood and shelter, and never receiving a dollar of money for \"salary\"\nor preaching--Elias, through good bodily health and strength, continues\ntill quite the age of eighty. It was thus at one of his latest jaunts in\nBrooklyn city I saw and heard him. This sight and hearing shall now be\ndescribed.\n\nElias Hicks was at this period in the latter part (November or December)\nof 1829. It was the last tour of the many missions of the old man's\nlife. He was in the 81st year of his age, and a few months before he\nhad lost by death a beloved wife with whom he had lived in unalloyed\naffection and esteem for 58 years. (But a few months after this meeting\nElias was paralyzed and died.) Though it is sixty years ago since--and I\na little boy at the time in Brooklyn, New York--I can remember my father\ncoming home toward sunset from his day's work as carpenter, and saying\nbriefly, as he throws down his armful of kindling-blocks with a bounce\non the kitchen floor, \"Come, mother, Elias preaches to-night.\" Then my\nmother, hastening the supper and the table-cleaning afterward, gets a\nneighboring young woman, a friend of the family, to step in and keep\nhouse for an hour or so--puts the two little ones to bed--and as I had\nbeen behaving well that day, as a special reward I was allow'd to go\nalso.\n\nWe start for the meeting. Though, as I said, the stretch of more than\nhalf a century has pass'd over me since then, with its war and peace,\nand all its joys and sins and deaths (and what a half century! how it\ncomes up sometimes for an instant, like the lightning flash in a storm\nat night!) I can recall that meeting yet. It is a strange place\nfor religious devotions. Elias preaches anywhere--no respect to\nbuildings--private or public houses, school-rooms, barns, even\ntheatres--anything that will accommodate. This time it is in a handsome\nball-room, on Brooklyn Heights, overlooking New York, and in full sight\nof that great city, and its North and East rivers fill'd with ships--is\n(to specify more particularly) the second story of \"Morrison's Hotel,\"\nused for the most genteel concerts, balls, and assemblies--a large,\ncheerful, gay-color'd room, with glass chandeliers bearing myriads of\nsparkling pendants, plenty of settees and chairs, and a sort of velvet\ndivan running all round the side-walls. Before long the divan and all\nthe settees and chairs are fill'd; many fashionables out of curiosity;\nall the principal dignitaries of the town, Gen. Jeremiah Johnson, Judge\nFurman, George Hall, Mr. Willoughby, Mr. Pierrepont, N.B. Morse, Cyrus\nP. Smith, and F.C. Tucker. Many young folks too; some richly dress'd\nwomen; I remember I noticed with one party of ladies a group of\nuniform'd officers, either from the U.S. Navy Yard, or some ship in the\nstream, or some adjacent fort. On a slightly elevated platform at the\nhead of the room, facing the audience, sit a dozen or more Friends, most\nof them elderly, grim, and with their broad-brimm'd hats on their heads.\nThree or four women, too, in their characteristic Quaker costumes and\nbonnets. All still as the grave.\n\nAt length after a pause and stillness becoming almost painful, Elias\nrises and stands for a moment or two without a word. A tall, straight\nfigure, neither stout nor very thin, dress'd in drab cloth, clean-shaved\nface, forehead of great expanse, and large and clear black eyes,[42]\nlong or middling-long white hair; he was at this time between 80 and 81\nyears of age, his head still wearing the broad-brim. A moment looking\naround the audience with those piercing eyes, amid the perfect\nstillness. (I can almost see him and the whole scene now.) Then the\nwords come from his lips, very emphatically and slowly pronounc'd, in a\nresonant, grave, melodious voice, _What is the chief end of man? I was\ntold in my early youth, it was to glorify God, and seek and enjoy him\nforever._\n\nI cannot follow the discourse. It presently becomes very fervid, and in\nthe midst of its fervor he takes the broad-brim hat from his head, and\nalmost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind, continues with\nuninterrupted earnestness. But, I say, I cannot repeat, hardly suggest\nhis sermon. Though the differences and disputes of the formal division\nof the Society of Friends were even then under way, he did not allude\nto them at all. A pleading, tender, nearly agonizing conviction,\nand magnetic stream of natural eloquence, before which all minds and\nnatures, all emotions, high or low, gentle or simple, yielded entirely\nwithout exception, was its cause, method, and effect. Many, very many\nwere in tears. Years afterward in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the\nsailor's preacher, and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the\nresemblance to Elias Hicks's--not argumentative or intellectual, but so\npenetrating--so different from anything in the books--(different as the\nfresh air of a May morning or sea-shore breeze from the atmosphere of a\nperfumer's shop.)\n\nWhile he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing-song tone sometimes\nheard in such meetings; but in a moment or two more as if recollecting\nhimself, he breaks off, stops, and resumes in a natural tone. This\noccurs three or four times during the talk of the evening, till all\nconcludes.\n\nNow and then, at the many scores and hundreds--even thousands--of his\ndiscourses--as at this one--he was very mystical and radical,[43] and\nhad much to say of \"the light within.\" Very likely this same inner\nlight, (so dwelt upon by newer men, as by Fox and Barclay at the\nbeginning, and all Friends and deep thinkers since and now,) is perhaps\nonly another name for the religious conscience. In my opinion they have\nall diagnos'd, like superior doctors, the real in-most disease of our\ntimes, probably any times. Amid the huge inflammation call'd society,\nand that other inflammation call'd politics, what is there to-day of\nmoral power and ethic sanity as antiseptic to them and all? Though I\nthink the essential elements of the moral nature exist latent in the\ngood average people of the United States of to-day, and sometimes break\nout strongly, it is certain that any mark'd or dominating National\nMorality (if I may use the phrase) has not only not yet been develop'd,\nbut that--at any rate when the point of view is turn'd on business,\npolitics, competition, practical life, and in character and manners in\nour New World--there seems to be a hideous depletion, almost absence, of\nsuch moral nature. Elias taught throughout, as George Fox began it, or\nrather reiterated and verified it, the Platonic doctrine that the ideals\nof character, of justice, of religious action, whenever the highest is\nat stake, are to be conform'd to no outside doctrine of creeds, Bibles,\nlegislative enactments, conventionalities, or even decorums, but are to\nfollow the inward Deity-planted law of the emotional soul. In this only\nthe true Quaker, or Friend, has faith; and it is from rigidly, perhaps\nstrainingly carrying it out, that both the Old and New England records\nof Quakerdom show some unseemly and insane acts.\n\nIn one of the lives of Ralph Waldo Emerson is a list of lessons or\ninstructions, (\"seal'd orders\" the biographer calls them,) prepar'd by\nthe sage himself for his own guidance. Here is one:\n\n    Go forth with thy message among thy fellow-creatures; teach them that\n    they must trust themselves as guided by that inner light which dwells\n    with the pure in heart, to whom it was promis'd of old that they shall\n    see God.\n\nHow thoroughly it fits the life and theory of Elias Hicks. Then in Omar\nKhayyam:\n\n    I sent my soul through the Invisible,\n      Some letter of that after-life to spell,\n    And by-and-by my soul return'd to me,\n      And answer'd, \"I myself am Heaven and Hell.\"\n\nIndeed, of this important element of the theory and practice of\nQuakerism, the difficult-to-describe \"Light within\" or \"Inward Law, by\nwhich all must be either justified or condemn'd,\" I will not undertake\nwhere so many have fail'd--the task of making the statement of it for\nthe average comprehension. We will give, partly for the matter and\npartly as specimen of his speaking and writing style, what Elias Hicks\nhimself says in allusion to it--one or two of very many passages. Most\nof his discourses, like those of Epictetus and the ancient peripatetics,\nhave left no record remaining--they were extempore, and those were not\nthe times of reporters. Of one, however, deliver'd in Chester, Pa.,\ntoward the latter part of his career, there is a careful transcript; and\nfrom it (even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to\nbe pick'd and thrash'd out several times before you get the grain,) we\ngive the following extract:\n\n  I don't want to express a great many words; but I want you to be\n  call'd home to the substance. For the Scriptures, and all the\n  books in the world, can do no more; Jesus could do no more than to\n  recommend to this Comforter, which was the light in him. \"God is\n  light, and in him is no darkness at all; and if we walk in the\n  light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.\"\n  Because the light is one in all, and therefore it binds us together\n  in the bonds of love; for it is not only light, but love--that love\n  which casts out all fear. So that they who dwell in God dwell in\n  love, and they are constrain'd to walk in it; and if they \"walk in\n  it, they have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus\n  Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\"\n\n  But what blood, my friends? Did Jesus Christ, the Saviour, ever have\n  any material blood? Not a drop of it, my friends--not a drop of it.\n  That blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin, was the life of\n  the soul of Jesus. The soul of man has no material blood; but as the\n  outward material blood, created from the dust of the earth, is the\n  life of these bodies of flesh, so with respect to the soul, the\n  immortal and invisible spirit, its blood is that life which God\n  breath'd into it.\n\n  As we read, in the beginning, that \"God form'd man of the dust of\n  the ground, and breath'd into him the breath of life, and man became\n  a living soul.\" He breath'd into that soul, and it became alive to\n  God.\n\nThen, from one of his many letters, for he seems to have delighted in\ncorrespondence:\n\n  Some may query, What is the cross of Christ? To these I answer, It\n  is the perfect law of God, written on the tablet of the hear\n  and in the heart of every rational creature, in such indelible\n  characters that all the power of mortals cannot erase nor obliterate\n  it. Neither is there any power or means given or dispens'd to the\n  children of men, but this inward law and light, by which the true\n  and saving knowledge of God can be obtain' d. And by this inward law\n  and light, all will be either justified or condemn'd, and all made\n  to know God for themselves, and be left without excuse, agreeably to\n  the prophecy of Jeremiah, and the corroborating testimony of Jesus\n  in his last counsel and command to his disciples, not to depart from\n  Jerusalem till they should receive power from on high; assuring them\n  that they should receive power, when they had receiv'd the pouring\n  forth of the spirit upon them, which would qualify them to bear\n  witness of him in Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and to the uttermost\n  parts of the earth; which was verified in a marvellous manner on the\n  day of Pentecost, when thousands were converted to the Christian\n  faith in one day.\n\n  By which it is evident that nothing but this inward light and law,\n  as it is heeded and obey'd, ever did, or ever can, make a true\n  and real Christian and child of God. And until the professors\n  of Christianity agree to lay aside all their non-essentials in\n  religion, and rally to this unchangeable foundation and standard of\n  truth, wars and fightings, confusion and error, will prevail, and\n  the angelic song cannot be heard in our land--that of \"glory to God\n  in the highest, and on earth peace and good will to men.\"\n\n  But when all nations are made willing to make this inward law and\n  light the rule and standard of all their faith and works, then we\n  shall be brought to know and believe alike, that there is but one\n  Lord, one faith, and but one baptism; one God and Father, that is\n  above all, through all, and in all.\n\n  And then will all those glorious and consoling prophecies recorded\n  in the scriptures of truth be fulfill'd--\"He,\" the Lord, \"shall\n  judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they\n  shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into\n  pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up the sword against nation,\n  neither shall they learn war any more. The wolf also shall dwell\n  with the lamb; and the cow and the bear shall feed; and the lion\n  shall eat straw like the ox; and the sucking child shall play\n  the hole of the asp, and the wean'd child put his hand on the\n  cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy\n  mountain; for the earth,\" that is our earthly tabernacle, \"shall be\n  full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\"\n\nThe exposition in the last sentence, that the terms of the texts are not\nto be taken in their literal meaning, but in their spiritual one, and\nallude to a certain wondrous exaltation of the body, through religious\ninfluences, is significant, and is but one of a great number of\ninstances of much that is obscure, to \"the world's people,\" in the\npreachings of this remarkable man.\n\nThen a word about his physical oratory, connected with the preceding. If\nthere is, as doubtless there is, an unnameable something behind oratory,\na fund within or atmosphere without, deeper than art, deeper even than\nproof, that unnameable constitutional something Elias Hicks emanated\nfrom his very heart to the hearts of his audience, or carried with\nhim, or probed into, and shook and arous'd in them--a sympathetic germ,\nprobably rapport, lurking in every human eligibility, which no book,\nno rule, no statement has given or can give inherent knowledge,\nintuition--not even the best speech, or best put forth, but launch'd out\nonly by powerful human magnetism:\n\n    Unheard by sharpest ear--unformed in clearest eye, or cunningest\n      mind,\n    Nor lore, nor fame, nor happiness, nor wealth,\n    And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world,\n      incessantly,\n    Which you and I, and all, pursuing ever, ever miss;\n    Open, but still a secret--the real of the real--an illusion;\n    Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner;\n    Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme----historians in prose;\n    Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted;\n    Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter' d.\n\nThat remorse, too, for a mere worldly life--that aspiration towards the\nideal, which, however overlaid, lies folded latent, hidden, in perhaps\nevery character. More definitely, as near as I remember (aided by\nmy dear mother long afterward,) Elias Hicks's discourse there in the\nBrooklyn ball-room, was one of his old never-remitted appeals to that\nmoral mystical portion of human nature, the inner light. But it is\nmainly for the scene itself, and Elias's personnel, that I recall the\nincident.\n\nSoon afterward the old man died:\n\n  On first day morning, the 14th of 2d month (February, 1830,) he was\n  engaged in his room, writing to a friend, until a little after ten\n  o'clock, when he return'd to that occupied by the family, apparently\n  just attack'd by a paralytic affection, which nearly deprived h\n  of the use of his right side, and of the power of speech. Being\n  assisted to a chair near the fire, he manifested by signs, that the\n  letter which he had just finish'd, and which had been dropp'd\n  the way, should be taken care of; and on its being brought to him,\n  appear'd satisfied, and manifested a desire that all should sit down\n  and be still, seemingly sensible that his labours were brought to a\n  close, and only desirous of quietly waiting the final change. The\n  solemn composure at this time manifest in his countenance, w\n  very impressive, indicating that he was sensible the time of his\n  departure was at hand, and that the prospect of death brought no\n  terrors with it. During his last illness, his mental faculti\n  were occasionally obscured, yet he was at times enabled to give\n  satisfactory evidence to those around him, that all was well, and\n  that he felt nothing in his way.\n\n  His funeral took place on fourth day, the 3rd of 3rd month. It was\n  attended by a large concourse of Friends and others, and a solid\n  meeting was held on the occasion; after which, his remains were\n  interr'd in Friends' burial-ground at this place (Jericho, Queens\n  county, New York.)\n\nI have thought (even presented so incompletely, with such fearful\nhiatuses, and in my own feebleness and waning life) one might well\nmemorize this life of Elias Hicks. Though not eminent in literature or\npolitics or inventions or business, it is a token of not a few, and is\nsignificant. Such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiers--but I have\nthought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a sample--that this\none specially does. I have already compared it to a little flowing\nliquid rill of Nature's life, maintaining freshness. As if, indeed,\nunder the smoke of battles, the blare of trumpets, and the madness of\ncontending hosts--the screams of passion, the groans of the suffering,\nthe parching of struggles of money and politics, and all hell's heat and\nnoise and competition above and around--should come melting down from\nthe mountains from sources of unpolluted snows, far up there in God's\nhidden, untrodden recesses, and so rippling along among us low in the\nground, at men's very feet, a curious little brook of clear and cool,\nand ever-healthy, ever-living water.\n\n_Note.--The Separation_.--The division vulgarly call'd between Orthodox\nand Hicksites in the Society of Friends took place in 1827, '8 and '9.\nProbably it had been preparing some time. One who was present has since\ndescribed to me the climax, at a meeting of Friends in Philadelphia\ncrowded by a great attendance of both sexes, with Elias as principal\nspeaker. In the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these\nwords: \"The blood of Christ--the blood of Christ--why, my friends, the\nactual blood of Christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood\nof bulls and goats--not a bit more--not a bit.\" At these words, after\na momentary hush, commenced a great tumult. Hundreds rose to their\nfeet.... Canes were thump'd upon the floor. From all parts of the\nhouse angry mutterings. Some left the place, but more remain'd, with\nexclamations, flush'd faces and eyes. This was the definite utterance,\nthe overt act, which led to the separation. Families diverg'd--even\nhusbands and wives, parents and children, were separated.\n\nOf course what Elias promulg'd spread a great commotion among the\nFriends. Sometimes when he presented himself to speak in the meeting,\nthere would be opposition--this led to angry words, gestures, unseemly\nnoises, recriminations. Elias, at such times, was deeply affected--the\ntears roll'd in streams down his cheeks--he silently waited the close of\nthe dispute. \"Let the Friend speak; let the Friend speak!\" he would\nsay when his supporters in the meeting tried to bluff off some violent\northodox person objecting to the new doctrinaire. But he never recanted.\n\nA reviewer of the old dispute and separation made the following comments\non them in a paper ten years ago: \"It was in America, where there had\nbeen no persecution worth mentioning since Mary Dyer was hang'd on\nBoston Common, that about fifty years ago differences arose, singularly\nenough upon doctrinal points of the divinity of Christ and the nature\nof the atonement. Whoever would know how bitter was the controversy,\nand how much of human infirmity was found to be still lurking under\nbroad-brim hats and drab coats, must seek for the information in the\nLives of Elias Hicks and of Thomas Shillitoe, the latter an English\nFriend, who visited us at this unfortunate time, and who exercised his\ngifts as a peace-maker with but little success. The meetings, according\nto his testimony, were sometimes turn'd into mobs. The disruption was\nwide, and seems to have been final. Six of the ten yearly meetings were\ndivided; and since that time various sub-divisions have come, four\nor five in number. There has never, however, been anything like a\nrepetition of the excitement of the Hicksite controversy; and Friends of\nall kinds at present appear to have settled down into a solid, steady,\ncomfortable state, and to be working in their own way without troubling\nother Friends whose ways are different.\"\n\n_Note_.--Old persons, who heard this man in his day, and who glean'd\nimpressions from what they saw of him, (judg'd from their own points\nof views,) have, in their conversation with me, dwelt on another point.\nThey think Elias Hicks had a large element of personal ambition, the\npride of leadership, of establishing perhaps a sect that should reflect\nhis own name, and to which he should give especial form and character.\nVery likely. Such indeed seems the means, all through progress and\ncivilization, by which strong men and strong convictions achieve\nanything definite. But the basic foundation of Elias was undoubtedly\ngenuine religious fervor. He was like an old Hebrew prophet. He had the\nspirit of one, and in his later years look'd like one. What Carlyle says\nof John Knox will apply to him:\n\n  He is an instance to us how a man, by sincerity itself, becomes\n  heroic; it is the grand gift he has. We find in him a good, honest,\n  intellectual talent, no transcendent one;--a narrow, inconsiderable\n  man, as compared with Luther; but in heartfelt instinctive adherence\n  to truth, in _sincerity_ as we say, he has no superior; nay, one\n  might ask, What equal he has? The heart of him is of the true\n  Prophet cast. \"He lies there,\" said the Earl of Morton at Knox's\n  grave, \"who never fear'd the face of man.\" He resembles, more than\n  any of the moderns, an old Hebrew Prophet. The same inflexibility,\n  intolerance, rigid, narrow-looking adherence to God's truth.\n\n_A Note yet. The United States to-day_.--While under all previous\nconditions (even convictions) of society, Oriental, Feudal,\nEcclesiastical, and in all past (or present) Despotisms, through the\nentire past, there existed, and exists yet, in ally and fusion with\nthem, and frequently forming the main part of them, certain churches,\ninstitutes, priesthoods, fervid beliefs, &c., practically promoting\nreligious and moral action to the fullest degrees of which humanity\nthere under circumstances was capable, and often conserving all there\nwas of justice, art, literature, and good manners--it is clear I say,\nthat, under the Democratic Institutes of the United States, now and\nhenceforth, there are no equally genuine fountains of fervid beliefs,\nadapted to produce similar moral and religious results, according to\nour circumstances. I consider that the churches, sects, pulpits, of the\npresent day, in the United States, exist not by any solid convictions,\nbut by a sort of tacit, supercilious, scornful suffrance. Few speak\nopenly--none officially--against them. But the ostent continuously\nimposing, who is not aware that any such living fountains of belief in\nthem are now utterly ceas'd and departed from the minds of men?\n\n_A Lingering Note_.--In the making of a full man, all the other\nconsciences, (the emotional, courageous, intellectual, esthetic, &c.,)\nare to be crown'd and effused by the religious conscience. In the higher\nstructure of a human self, or of community, the Moral, the Religious,\nthe Spiritual, is strictly analogous to the subtle vitalization and\nantiseptic play call'd Health in the physiologic structure. To person or\nState, the main verteber (or rather _the_ verteber) is Morality.\n\nThat is indeed the only real vitalization of character, and of all the\nsupersensual, even heroic and artistic portions of man or nationality.\nIt is to run through and knit the superior parts, and keep man or State\nvital and upright, as health keeps the body straight and blooming. Of\ncourse a really grand and strong and beautiful character is probably to\nbe slowly grown, and adjusted strictly with reference to itself, its own\npersonal and social sphere--with (paradox though it may be) the clear\nunderstanding that the conventional theories of life, worldly ambition,\nwealth, office, fame, &c., are essentially but glittering mayas,\ndelusions.\n\nDoubtless the greatest scientists and theologians will sometimes find\nthemselves saying, It isn't only those who know most, who contribute\nmost to God's glory. Doubtless these very scientists at times stand with\nbared heads before the humblest lives and personalities. For there is\nsomething greater (is there not?) than all the science and poems of the\nworld--above all else, like the stars shining eternal--above Shakspere's\nplays, or Concord philosophy, or art of Angelo or Raphael--something\nthat shines elusive, like beams of Hesperus at evening--high above all\nthe vaunted wealth and pride--prov'd by its practical outcropping in\nlife, each case after its own concomitants--the intuitive blending of\ndivine love and faith in a human emotional character--blending for all,\nfor the unlearn'd, the common, and the poor.\n\nI don't know in what book I once read, (possibly the remark has been\nmade in books, all ages,) that no life ever lived, even the most\nuneventful, but, probed to its centre, would be found in itself as\nsubtle a drama as any that poets have ever sung, or playwrights fabled.\nOften, too, in size and weight, that life suppos'd obscure. For it isn't\nonly the palpable stars; astronomers say there are dark, or almost dark,\nunnotic'd orbs and suns, (like the dusky companions of Sirius, seven\ntimes as large as our own sun,) rolling through space, real and potent\nas any--perhaps the most real and potent. Yet none recks of them. In the\nbright lexicon we give the spreading heavens, they have not even names.\nAmid ceaseless sophistications all times, the soul would seem to glance\nyearningly around for such contrasts--such cool, still offsets.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n[42]In Walter Scott's reminiscences he speaks of Burns as having the\nmost eloquent, glowing, flashing, illuminated dark-orbed eyes he ever\nbeheld in a human face; and I think Elias Hicks's must have been like\nthem.\n\n[43] The true Christian religion, (such was the teaching of Elias\nHicks,) consists neither in rites or Bibles or sermons or Sundays--but\nin noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration, in purity, in a\ngood practical life, in charity to the poor and toleration to all. He\nsaid, \"A man may keep the Sabbath, may belong to a church and attend all\nthe observances, have regular family prayer, keep a well-bound copy of\nthe Hebrew Scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house, and yet not\nbe a truly religious person at all.\" E. believ'd little in a church\nas organiz'd-even his own--with houses, ministers, or with salaries,\ncreeds, Sundays, saints, Bibles, holy festivals, &c. But he believ'\nd always in the universal church, in the soul of man, invisibly rapt,\never-waiting, ever-responding to universal truths.--He was fond of pithy\nproverbs. He said, \"It matters not where you live, but how you live.\"\nHe said once to my father, \"They talk of the devil--I tell thee, Walter,\nthere is no worse devil than man.\"\n\n\nGEORGE FOX (AND SHAKSPERE)\n\nWhile we are about it, we must almost Inevitably go back to the origin\nof the Society of which Elias Hicks has so far prov'd to be the most\nmark'd individual result. We must revert to the latter part of the\n16th, and all, or nearly all of that 17th century, crowded with so many\nimportant historical events, changes, and personages. Throughout Europe,\nand especially in what we call our Mother Country, men were unusually\narous'd--(some would say demented.) It was a special age of the insanity\nof witch-trials and witch-hangings. In one year 60 were hung for\nwitchcraft in one English county alone. It was peculiarly an age\nof military-religious conflict. Protestantism and Catholicism were\nwrestling like giants for the mastery, straining every nerve. Only to\nthink of it--that age! its events, persons--Shakspere just dead, (his\nfolios publish'd, complete)--Charles 1st, the shadowy spirit and the\nsolid block! To sum up all, it was the age of Cromwell!\n\nAs indispensable foreground, indeed, for Elias Hicks, and perhaps sine\nqua non to an estimate of the kind of man, we must briefly transport\nourselves back to the England of that period. As I say, it is the time\nof tremendous moral and political agitation; ideas of conflicting forms,\ngovernments, theologies, seethe and dash like ocean storms, and ebb and\nflow like mighty tides. It was, or had been, the time of the long feud\nbetween the Parliament and the Crown. In the midst of the sprouts, began\nGeorge Fox--born eight years after the death of Shakspere. He was the\nson of a weaver, himself a shoemaker, and was \"converted\" before the age\nof 20. But O the sufferings, mental and physical, through which those\nyears of the strange youth pass'd! He claim'd to be sent by God to\nfulfill a mission. \"I come,\" he said, \"to direct people to the spirit\nthat gave forth the Scriptures.\" The range of his thought, even then,\ncover'd almost every important subject of after times, anti-slavery,\nwomen's rights, &c. Though in a low sphere, and among the masses, he\nforms a mark'd feature in the age.\n\nAnd how, indeed, beyond all any, that stormy and perturb'd age! The\nfoundations of the old, the superstitious, the conventionally poetic,\nthe credulous, all breaking--the light of the new, and of science and\ndemocracy, definitely beginning--a mad, fierce, almost crazy age!\nThe political struggles of the reigns of the Charleses, and of the\nProtectorate of Cromwell, heated to frenzy by theological struggles.\nThose were the years following the advent and practical working of the\nReformation--but Catholicism is yet strong, and yet seeks supremacy. We\nthink our age full of the flush of men and doings, and culminations of\nwar and peace; and so it is. But there could hardly be a grander and\nmore picturesque and varied age than that.\n\nBorn out of and in this age, when Milton, Bunyan, Dryden and John Locke\nwere still living--amid the memories of Queen Elizabeth and James First,\nand the events of their reigns--when the radiance of that galaxy\nof poets, warriors, statesmen, captains, lords, explorers, wits and\ngentlemen, that crowded the courts and times of those sovereigns still\nfill'd the atmosphere--when America commencing to be explor'd and\nsettled commenc'd also to be suspected as destin'd to overthrow the old\nstandards and calculations--when Feudalism, like a sunset, seem'd\nto gather all its glories, reminiscences, personalisms, in one last\ngorgeous effort, before the advance of a new day, a new incipient\ngenius--amid the social and domestic circles of that period--indifferent\nto reverberations that seem'd enough to wake the dead, and in a sphere\nfar from the pageants of the court, the awe of any personal rank\nor charm of intellect, or literature, or the varying excitement of\nParliamentarian or Royalist fortunes--this curious young rustic goes\nwandering up and down England.\n\nGeorge Fox, born 1624, was of decent stock, in ordinary lower life--as\nhe grew along toward manhood, work'd at shoemaking, also at farm\nlabors--loved to be much by himself, half-hidden in the woods,\nreading the Bible--went about from town to town, dress'd in leather\nclothes--walk'd much at night, solitary, deeply troubled (\"the inward\ndivine teaching of the Lord\")--sometimes goes among the ecclesiastical\ngatherings of the great professors, and though a mere youth bears\nbold testimony--goes to and fro disputing--(must have had great\npersonality)--heard the voice of the Lord speaking articulately to\nhim, as he walk'd in the fields--feels resistless commands not to be\nexplain'd, but follow'd, to abstain from taking off his hat, to say\n_Thee_ and _Thou_, and not bid others Good morning or Good evening-was\nilliterate, could just read and write-testifies against shows, games,\nand frivolous pleasures--enters the courts and warns the judges that\nthey see to doing justice--goes into public houses and market-places,\nwith denunciations of drunkenness and money-making--rises in the midst\nof the church-services, and gives his own explanations of the ministers'\nexplanations, and of Bible passages and texts--sometimes for such things\nput in prison, sometimes struck fiercely on the mouth on the spot, or\nknock'd down, and lying there beaten and bloody--was of keen wit, ready\nto any question with the most apropos of answers--was sometimes press'd\nfor a soldier, (_him_ for a soldier!)--was indeed terribly buffeted;\nbut goes, goes, goes--often sleeping out-doors, under hedges, or\nhay stacks--forever taken before justices--improving such, and all\noccasions, to _bear testimony_, and give good advice--still enters the\n\"steeple-houses,\" (as he calls churches,) and though often dragg'd\nout and whipt till he faints away, and lies like one dead, when he\ncomes-to--stands up again, and offering himself all bruis'd and bloody,\ncries out to his tormenters, \"Strike--strike again, here where you have\nnot yet touch'd! my arms, my head, my cheeks,\"--Is at length arrested\nand sent up to London, confers with the Protector, Cromwell,--is set at\nliberty, and holds great meetings in London.\n\nThus going on, there is something in him that fascinates one or two\nhere, and three or four there, until gradually there were others who\nwent about in the same spirit, and by degrees the Society of Friends\ntook shape, and stood among the thousand religious sects of the world.\nWomen also catch the contagion, and go round, often shamefully misused.\nBy such contagion these ministerings, by scores, almost hundreds of poor\ntravelling men and women, keep on year after year, through ridicule,\nwhipping, imprisonment, &c.--some of the Friend-ministers emigrate to\nNew England--where their treatment makes the blackest part of the early\nannals of the New World. Some were executed, others maim'd, par-burnt,\nand scourg'd--two hundred die in prison--some on the gallows, or at the\nstake.\n\nGeorge Fox himself visited America, and found a refuge and hearers, and\npreach'd many times on Long Island, New York State. In the village\nof Oysterbay they will show you the rock on which he stood, (1672,)\naddressing the multitude, in the open air--thus rigidly following the\nfashion of apostolic times.--(I have heard myself many reminiscences of\nhim.) Flushing also contains (or contain'd--I have seen them) memorials\nof Fox, and his son, in two aged white-oak trees, that shaded him while\nhe bore his testimony to people gather'd in the highway.--Yes, the\nAmerican Quakers were much persecuted--almost as much, by a sort of\nconsent of all the other sects, as the Jews were in Europe in the\nmiddle ages. In New England, the cruelest laws were pass'd, and put in\nexecution against them. As said, some were whipt--women the same as\nmen. Some had their ears cut off--others their tongues pierc'd with hot\nirons--others their faces branded. Worse still, a woman and three men\nhad been hang'd, (1660.)--Public opinion, and the statutes, join'd\ntogether, in an odious union, Quakers, Baptists, Roman Catholics and\nWitches.--Such a fragmentary sketch of George Fox and his time--and the\nadvent of \"the Society of Friends\" in America.\n\nStrange as it may sound, Shakspere and George Fox, (think of them!\ncompare them!) were born and bred of similar stock, in much the same\nsurroundings and station in life--from the same England--and at\na similar period. One to radiate all of art's, all literature's\nsplendor--a splendor so dazzling that he himself is almost lost in it,\nand his contemporaries the same--his fictitious Othello, Romeo, Hamlet,\nLear, as real as any lords of England or Europe then and there--more\nreal to us, the mind sometimes thinks, than the man Shakspere himself.\nThen the other--may we indeed name him the same day? What is poor plain\nGeorge Fox compared to William Shakspere--to fancy's lord, imagination's\nheir? Yet George Fox stands for something too--a thought--the thought\nthat wakes in silent hours--perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought\nlatent in the human soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the\nthoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity. Great, great is\nthis thought--aye, greater than all else. When the gorgeous pageant of\nArt, refulgent in the sunshine, color'd with roses and gold--with all\nthe richest mere poetry, old or new, (even Shakespere's) with all that\nstatue, play, painting, music, architecture, oratory, can effect, ceases\nto satisfy and please--When the eager chase after wealth flags, and\nbeauty itself becomes a loathing--and when all worldly or carnal or\nesthetic, or even scientific values, having done their office to the\nhuman character, and minister'd their part to its development--then,\nif not before, comes forward this over-arching thought, and brings its\neligibilities, germinations. Most neglected in life of all humanity's\nattributes, easily cover'd with crust, deluded and abused, rejected, yet\nthe only certain source of what all are seeking, but few or none finding\nit I for myself clearly see the first, the last, the deepest depths and\nhighest heights of art, of literature, and of the purposes of life. I\nsay whoever labors here, makes contributions here, or best of all\nsets an incarnated example here, of life or death, is dearest to\nhumanity--remains after the rest are gone. And here, for these purposes,\nand up to the light that was in him, the man Elias Hicks--as the man\nGeorge Fox had done years before him--lived long, and died, faithful in\nlife, and faithful in death.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOOD-BYE MY FANCY\n\n\n\nAN OLD MAN'S REJOINDER\n\nIn the domain of Literature loftily consider'd (an accomplish'd and\nveteran critic in his just out work[44] now says,) 'the kingdom of the\nFather has pass'd; the kingdom of the Son is passing; the kingdom of the\nSpirit begins.' Leaving the reader to chew on and extract the juice and\nmeaning of this, I will proceed to say in melanged form what I have had\nbrought out by the English author's essay (he discusses the poetic art\nmostly) on my own, real, or by him supposed, views and purports. If I\ngive any answers to him, or explanations of what my books intend, they\nwill be not direct but indirect and derivative. Of course this brief\njotting is personal. Something very like querulous egotism and growling\nmay break through the narrative (for I have been and am rejected by all\nthe great magazines, carry now my 72d annual burden, and have been a\nparalytic for 18 years.)\n\nNo great poem or other literary or artistic work of any scope, old\nor new, can be essentially consider'd without weighing first the age,\npolitics (or want of politics) and aim, visible forms, unseen soul, and\ncurrent times, out of the midst of which it rises and is formulated:\nas the Biblic canticles and their days and spirit--as the Homeric, or\nDante's utterance, or Shakspere's, or the old Scotch or Irish ballads,\nor Ossian, or Omar Khayyam. So I have conceiv'd and launch'd, and work'd\nfor years at, my 'Leaves of Grass'--personal emanations only at best,\nbut with specialty of emergence and background--the ripening of the\nnineteenth century, the thought and fact and radiation of individuality,\nof America, the secession war, and showing the democratic conditions\nsupplanting everything that insults them or impedes their aggregate way.\nDoubtless my poems illustrate (one of novel thousands to come for a long\nperiod) those conditions; but \"democratic art\" will have to wait long\nbefore it is satisfactorily formulated and defined--if it ever is.\n\nI will now for one indicative moment lock horns with what many Think\nthe greatest thing, the question of _art_, so-call'd. I have not seen\nwithout learning something therefrom, how, with hardly an exception,\nthe poets of this age devote themselves, always mainly, sometimes\naltogether, to fine rhyme, spicy verbalism, the fabric and cut of the\ngarment, jewelry, _concetti_, style, art. To-day these adjuncts\nare certainly the effort, beyond all else, yet the lesson of Nature\nundoubtedly is, to proceed with single purpose toward the result\nnecessitated, and for which the time has arrived, utterly regardless of\nthe outputs of shape, appearance or criticism, which are always left to\nsettle themselves. I have not only not bother'd much about style,\nform, art, etc., but confess to more or less apathy (I believe I have\nsometimes caught myself in decided aversion) toward them throughout,\nasking nothing of them but negative advantages--that they should never\nimpede me, and never under any circumstances, or for their own purposes\nonly, assume any mastery over me.\n\nFrom the beginning I have watch'd the sharp and sometimes heavy and\ndeep-penetrating objections and reviews against my work, and I hope\nentertain'd and audited them; (for I have probably had an advantage in\nconstructing from a central and unitary principle since the first, but\nat long intervals and stages--sometimes lapses of five or six years, or\npeace or war.) Ruskin, the Englishman, charges as a fearful and serious\nlack that my poems have no humor. A profound German critic complains\nthat, compared with the luxuriant and well-accepted songs of the world,\nthere is about my verse a certain coldness, severity, absence of spice,\npolish, or of consecutive meaning and plot. (The book is autobiographic\nat bottom, and may-be I do not exhibit and make ado about the stock\npassions: I am partly of Quaker stock.) Then E.C. Stedman finds (or\nfound) mark'd fault with me because while celebrating the common people\n_en masse_, I do not allow enough heroism and moral merit and good\nintentions to the choicer classes, the college-bred, the _etat-major_.\nIt is quite probable that S. is right in the matter. In the main I\nmyself look, and have from the first look'd, to the bulky democratic\n_torso_ of the United States even for esthetic and moral attributes\nof serious account--and refused to aim at or accept anything less. If\nAmerica is only for the rule and fashion and small typicality of other\nlands (the rule of the _etat-major_) it is not the land I take it for,\nand should to-day feel that my literary aim and theory had been blanks\nand misdirections. Strictly judged, most modern poems are but larger\nor smaller lumps of sugar, or slices of toothsome sweet cake--even the\nbanqueters dwelling on those glucose flavors as a main part of the dish.\nWhich perhaps leads to something: to have great heroic poetry we need\ngreat readers--a heroic appetite and audience. Have we at present any\nsuch?\n\nThen the thought at the centre, never too often repeated. Boundless\nmaterial wealth, free political organization, immense geographic\narea, and unprecedented \"business\" and products--even the most active\nintellect and \"culture\"--will not place this Commonwealth of ours on the\ntopmost range of history and humanity--or any eminence of \"democratic\nart\"--to say nothing of its pinnacle. Only the production (and on the\nmost copious scale) of loftiest moral, spiritual and heroic personal\nillustrations--a great native Literature headed with a Poetry stronger\nand sweeter than any yet. If there can be any such thing as a kosmic\nmodern and original song, America needs it, and is worthy of it.\n\nIn my opinion to-day (bitter as it is to say so) the outputs through\ncivilized nations everywhere from the great words Literature, Art,\nReligion, &c., with their conventional administerers, stand squarely in\nthe way of what the vitalities of those great words signify, more than\nthey really prepare the soil for them--or plant the seeds, or cultivate\nor garner the crop. My own opinion has long been, that for New World\nservice our ideas of beauty (inherited from the Greeks, and so on to\nShakspere--_query_--perverted from them?) need to be radically changed,\nand made anew for to-day's purposes and finer standards. But if so,\nit will all come in due time--the real change will be an autochthonic,\ninterior, constitutional, even local one, from which our notions of\nbeauty (lines and colors are wondrous lovely, but character is lovelier)\nwill branch or offshoot.\n\nSo much have I now rattled off (old age's garrulity,) that there is not\nspace for explaining the most important and pregnant principle of all,\nviz., that Art is one, is not partial, but includes all times and forms\nand sorts--is not exclusively aristocratic or democratic, or oriental or\noccidental. My favorite symbol would be a good font of type, where the\nimpeccable long-primer rejects nothing. Or the old Dutch flour-miller\nwho said, \"I never bother myself what road the folks come--I only want\ngood wheat and rye.\"\n\nThe font is about the same forever. Democratic art results of democratic\ndevelopment, from tinge, true nationality, belief, in the one setting up\nfrom it.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[44] Two new volumes, \"Essays Speculative and Suggestive,\" by John\nAddington Symonds. One of the Essays is on \"Democratic Art,\" in which I\nand my books are largely alluded to and cited and dissected. It is\nthis part of the vols. that has caused the off-hand lines above--(first\nthanking Mr. S. for his invariable courtesy of personal treatment).\n\n\nOLD POETS\n\nPoetry (I am clear) is eligible of something far more ripen'd and ample,\nour lands and pending days, than it has yet produced from any utterance\nold or new. Modern or new poetry, too, (viewing or challenging it with\nsevere criticism,) is largely a-void--while the very cognizance, or even\nsuspicion of that void, and the need of filling it, proves a certainty\nof the hidden and waiting supply. Leaving other lands and languages to\nspeak for themselves, we can abruptly but deeply suggest it best from\nour own--going first to oversea illustrations, and standing on them.\nThink of Byron, Burns, Shelley, Keats, (even first-raters, \"the brothers\nof the radiant summit,\" as William O'Connor calls them,) as having done\nonly their precursory and 'prentice work, and all their best and real\npoems being left yet unwrought, untouch'd. Is it difficult to imagine\nahead of us and them, evolv'd from them, poesy completer far than any\nthey themselves fulfill'd? One has in his eye and mind some very large,\nvery old, entirely sound and vital tree or vine, like certain hardy,\never-fruitful specimens in California and Canada, or down in\nMexico, (and indeed in all lands) beyond the chronological\nrecords--illustrations of growth, continuity, power, amplitude\nand _exploitation_, almost beyond statement, but proving fact and\npossibility, outside of argument.\n\nPerhaps, indeed, the rarest and most blessed quality of transcendent\nnoble poetry--as of law, and of the profoundest wisdom and\nestheticism--is, (I would suggest,) from sane, completed, vital, capable\nold age.\n\nThe final proof of song or personality is a sort of matured, accreted,\nsuperb, evoluted, almost divine, impalpable diffuseness and atmosphere\nor invisible magnetism, dissolving and embracing all--and not any\nspecial achievement of passion, pride, metrical form, epigram, plot,\nthought, or what is call'd beauty. The bud of the rose or the half-blown\nflower is beautiful, of course, but only the perfected bloom or apple\nor finish'd wheat-head is beyond the rest. Completed fruitage like\nthis comes (in my opinion) to a grand age, in man or woman, through an\nessentially sound continuated physiology and psychology (both important)\nand is the culminating glorious aureole of all and several preceding.\nLike the tree or vine just mention'd, it stands at last in a beauty,\npower and productiveness of its own, above all others, and of a sort and\nstyle uniting all criticisms, proofs and adherences.\n\nLet us diversify the matter a little by portraying some of the American\npoets from our own point of view.\n\nLongfellow, reminiscent, polish'd, elegant, with the air of finest\nconventional library, picture-gallery or parlor, with ladies and\ngentlemen in them, and plush and rosewood, and ground-glass lamps, and\nmahogany and ebony furniture, and a silver inkstand and scented satin\npaper to write on.\n\nWhittier stands for morality (not in any all-accepting philosophic or\nHegelian sense, but) filter'd through a Puritanical or Quaker filter--is\nincalculably valuable as a genuine utterance, (and the finest,)--with\nmany local and Yankee and _genre_ bits--all hued with anti-slavery\ncoloring--(the _genre_ and anti-slavery contributions all precious--all\nhelp.) Whittier's is rather a grand figure, but pretty lean and\nascetic--no Greek-not universal and composite enough (don't try--don't\nwish to be) for ideal Americanism. Ideal Americanism would take the\nGreek spirit and law, and democratize and scientize and (thence) truly\nChristianize them for the whole, the globe, all history, all ranks\nand lands, all facts, all good and bad. (Ah this _bad_--this\nnineteen-twentieths of us all! What a stumbling-block it remains for\npoets and metaphysicians--what a chance (the strange, clear-as-ever\ninscription on the old dug-up tablet) it offers yet for being\ntranslated--what can be its purpose in the God-scheme of this universe,\nand all?)\n\nThen William Cullen Bryant--meditative, serious, from first to last\ntending to threnodies--his genius mainly lyrical--when reading his\npieces who could expect or ask for more magnificent ones than such\nas \"The Battle-Field,\" and \"A Forest Hymn\"? Bryant, unrolling,\nprairie-like, notwithstanding his mountains and lakes--moral enough\n(yet worldly and conventional)--a naturalist, pedestrian, gardener\nand fruiter--well aware of books, but mixing to the last in cities and\nsociety. I am not sure but his name ought to lead the list of American\nbards. Years ago I thought Emerson pre eminent (and as to the last\npolish and intellectual cuteness may-be I think so still)--but, for\nreasons, I have been gradually tending to give the file-leading place\nfor American native poesy to W. C. B.\n\nOf Emerson I have to confirm my already avow'd opinion regarding his\nhighest bardic and personal attitude. Of the galaxy of the past--of Poe,\nHalleck, Mrs. Sigourney, Allston, Willis, Dana,\n\nJohn Pierpont, W. G. Simms, Robert Sands, Drake, Hillhouse, Theodore\nFay, Margaret Fuller, Epes Sargent, Boker, Paul Hayne, Lanier, and\nothers, I fitly in essaying such a theme as this, and reverence for\ntheir memories, may at least give a heart-benison on the list of their\nnames.\n\nTime and New World humanity having the venerable resemblances more than\nanything else, and being \"the same subject continued,\" just here in\n1890, one gets a curious nourishment and lift (I do) from all those\ngrand old veterans, Bancroft, Kossuth, von Moltke--and such typical\nspecimen-reminiscences as Sophocles and Goethe, genius, health, beauty\nof person, riches, rank, renown and length of days, all combining and\ncentering in one case.\n\nAbove everything, what could humanity and literature do without the\nmellow, last-justifying, averaging, bringing-up of many, many years--a\ngreat old age amplified? Every really first-class production has likely\nto pass through the crucial tests of a generation, perhaps several\ngenerations. Lord Bacon says the first sight of any work really new\nand first-rate in beauty and originality always arouses something\ndisagreeable and repulsive. Voltaire term'd the Shaksperean works \"a\nhuge dunghill\"; Hamlet he described (to the Academy, whose members\nlisten'd with approbation) as \"the dream of a drunken savage, with a\nfew flashes of beautiful thoughts.\" And not the Ferney sage alone;\nthe orthodox judges and law-givers of France, such as La Harpe, J. L.\nGeoffrey, and Chateaubriand, either join'd in Voltaire's verdict, or\nwent further. Indeed the classicists and regulars there still hold to\nit. The lesson is very significant in all departments. People resent\nanything new as a personal insult. When umbrellas were first used in\nEngland, those who carried them were hooted and pelted so furiously that\ntheir lives were endanger'd. The same rage encounter'd the attempt in\ntheatricals to perform women's parts by real women, which was publicly\nconsider'd disgusting and outrageous. Byron thought Pope's verse\nincomparably ahead of Homer and Shakspere. One of the prevalent\nobjections, in the days of Columbus was, the learn'd men boldly asserted\nthat if a ship should reach India she would never get back again,\nbecause the rotundity of the globe would present a kind of mountain, up\nwhich it would be impossible to sail even with the most favorable wind.\n\n\"Modern poets,\" says a leading Boston journal, \"enjoy longevity.\nBrowning lived to be seventy-seven. Wordsworth, Bryant, Emerson, and\nLongfellow were old men. Whittier, Tennyson, and Walt Whitman still\nlive.\"\n\nStarted out by that item on Old Poets and Poetry for chyle to inner\nAmerican sustenance--I have thus gossipp'd about it all, and treated it\nfrom my own point of view, taking the privilege of rambling wherever the\ntalk carried me. Browning is lately dead; Bryant, Emerson and Longfellow\nhave not long pass'd away; and yes, Whittier and Tennyson remain, over\neighty years old--the latter having sent out not long since a fresh\nvolume, which the English-speaking Old and New Worlds are yet reading. I\nhave already put on record my notions of T. and his effusions: they are\nvery attractive and flowery to me--but flowers, too, are at least as\nprofound as anything; and by common consent T. is settled as the poetic\ncream-skimmer of our age's melody, _ennui_ and polish--a verdict in\nwhich I agree, and should say that nobody (not even Shakspere)\ngoes deeper in those exquisitely touch'd and half-hidden hints and\nindirections left like faint perfumes in the crevices of his lines. Of\nBrowning I don't know enough to say much; he must be studied deeply out,\ntoo, and quite certainly repays the trouble--but I am old and indolent,\nand cannot study (and never did.)\n\nGrand as to-day's accumulative fund of poetry is, there is certainly\nsomething unborn, not yet come forth, different from anything\nnow formulated in any verse, or contributed by the past in any\nland--something waited for, craved, hitherto non-express'd. What it\nwill be, and how, no one knows. It will probably have to prove itself by\nitself and its readers. One thing, it must run through entire humanity\n(this new word and meaning Solidarity has arisen to us moderns) twining\nall lands like a divine thread, stringing all beads, pebbles or gold,\nfrom God and the soul, and like God's dynamics and sunshine illustrating\nall and having reference to all. From anything like a cosmical point of\nview, the entirety of imaginative literature's themes and results as\nwe get them to-day seems painfully narrow. All that has been put in\nstatement, tremendous as it is, what is it compared with the vast fields\nand values and varieties left unreap'd? Of our own country, the splendid\nraces North or South, and especially of the Western and Pacific regions,\nit sometimes seems to me their myriad noblest Homeric and Biblic\nelements are all untouch'd, left as if ashamed of, and only certain very\nminor occasional _delirium tremens_ glints studiously sought and put in\nprint, in short tales, \"poetry\" or books.\n\nI give these speculations, or notions, in all their audacity, for the\ncomfort of thousands--perhaps a majority of ardent minds, women's and\nyoung men's--who stand in awe and despair before the immensity of suns\nand stars already in the firmament. Even in the Iliad and Shakspere\nthere is (is there not?) a certain humiliation produced to us by the\nabsorption of them, unless we sound in equality, or above them,\nthe songs due our own democratic era and surroundings, and the full\nassertion of ourselves. And in vain (such is my opinion) will\nAmerica seek successfully to tune any superb national song unless the\nheart-strings of the people start it from their own breasts--to be\nreturn'd and echoed there again.\n\n\nSHIP AHOY\n\n    In dreams I was a ship, and sail'd the boundless seas,\n    Sailing and ever sailing--all seas and into every port, or out\n      upon the offing,\n    Saluting, cheerily hailing each mate, met or pass'd, little or big,\n    \"Ship ahoy!\" thro' trumpet or by voice--if nothing more, some\n      friendly merry word at least,\n    For companionship and good will for ever to all and each.\n\n\nFOR QUEEN VICTORIA'S BIRTHDAY\n\n_An American arbutus bunch to be put in a little vase on the royal\nbreakfast table May 24th, 1890_.\n\nLady, accept a birth-day thought--haply an idle gift and token, Right\nfrom the scented soil's May-utterance here, (Smelling of countless\nblessings, prayers, and old-time thanks,)[45] A bunch of white and pink\narbutus, silent, spicy, shy, From Hudson's, Delaware's, or Potomac's\nwoody banks.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[45] NOTE.--Very little, as we Americans stand this day, with our\nsixty-five or seventy millions of population, an immense surplus in the\ntreasury, and all that actual power or reserve power (land and sea) so\ndear to nations--very little I say do we realize that curious crawling\nnational shudder when the \"Trent affair\" promis'd to bring upon us a war\nwith Great Britain--follow'd unquestionably, as that war would have, by\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy from all the leading European\nnations. It is now certain that all this then inevitable train of\ncalamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and\nwritten missive of the British Minister, to America, which the Queen\n(and Prince Albert latent) positively and promptly cancell'd; and which\nher firm attitude did alone actually erase and leave out, against all\nthe other official prestige and Court of St. James's. On such minor and\npersonal incidents (so to call them,) often depend the great growths and\nturns of civilization. This moment of a woman and a queen surely swung\nthe grandest oscillation of modern history's pendulum. Many sayings and\ndoings of that period, from foreign potentates and powers, might well be\ndropt in oblivion by America--but never _this_, if I could have my way.\nW. W.\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAN NATIONAL LITERATURE\n\n_Is there any such thing--or can there ever be?_\n\n\nSo you want an essay about American National Literature, (tremendous\nand fearful subject!) do you?[46] Well, if you will let me put down some\nmelanged cogitations regarding the matter, hap-hazard, and from my own\npoints of view, I will try. Horace Greeley wrote a book named \"Hints\ntoward Reforms,\" and the title-line was consider'd the best part of all.\nIn the present case I will give a few thoughts and suggestions, of good\nand ambitious intent enough anyhow--first reiterating the question right\nout plainly: American National Literature--is there distinctively\nany such thing, or can there ever be? First to me comes an almost\nindescribably august form, the People, with varied typical shapes and\nattitudes-then the divine mirror, Literature.\n\nAs things are, probably no more puzzling question ever offer'd itself\nthan (going back to old Nile for a trope,) What bread-seeds of printed\nmentality shall we cast upon America's waters, to grow and return after\nmany days? Is there for the future authorship of the United States any\nbetter way than submission to the teeming facts, events, activities, and\nimportations already vital through and beneath them all? I have often\nponder'd it, and felt myself disposed to let it go at that. Indeed, are\nnot those facts and activities and importations potent and certain to\nfulfil themselves all through our Commonwealth, irrespective of any\nattempt from individual guidance? But allowing all, and even at that,\na good part of the matter being honest discussion, examination, and\nearnest personal presentation, we may even for sanitary exercise and\ncontact plunge boldly into the spread of the many waves and cross-tides,\nas follows. Or, to change the figure, I will present my varied little\ncollation (what is our Country itself but an infinitely vast and varied\ncollation?) in the hope that the show itself indicates a duty getting\nmore and more incumbent every day.\n\nIn general, civilization's totality or real representative National\nLiterature formates itself (like language, or \"the weather\") not\nfrom two or three influences, however important, nor from any learned\nsyllabus, or criticism, or what ought to be, nor from any minds\nor advice of toploftical quarters--and indeed not at all from the\ninfluences and ways ostensibly supposed (though they too are adopted,\nafter a sort)--but slowly, slowly, curiously, from many more and more,\ndeeper mixings and siftings (especially in America) and generations\nand years and races, and what largely appears to be chance--but is not\nchance at all. First of all, for future National Literature in America,\nNew England (the technically moral and schoolmaster region, as a cynical\nfellow I know calls it) and the three or four great Atlantic-coast\ncities, highly as they to-day suppose they dominate the whole, will\nhave to haul in their horns. _Ensemble_ is the tap-root of National\nLiterature. America is become already a huge world of peoples, rounded\nand orbic climates, idiocrasies, and geographies--forty-four Nations\ncuriously and irresistibly blent and aggregated in ONE NATION, with one\nimperial language, and one unitary set of social and legal standards\nover all--and (I predict) a yet to be National Literature. (In my mind\nthis last, if it ever comes, is to prove grander and more important for\nthe Commonwealth than its politics and material wealth and trade, vast\nand indispensable as those are.)\n\nThink a moment what must, beyond peradventure, be the real permanent\nsub-bases, or lack of them. Books profoundly considered show a great\nnation more than anything else--more than laws or manners. (This is,\nof course, probably the deep-down meaning of that well-buried but\never-vital platitude, Let me sing the people's songs, and I don't care\nwho makes their laws.) Books too reflect humanity _en masse_, and surely\nshow them splendidly, or the reverse, and prove or celebrate their\nprevalent traits (these last the main things.) Homer grew out of and\nhas held the ages, and holds to-day, by the universal admiration\nfor personal prowess, courage, rankness, _amour propre_, leadership,\ninherent in the whole human race. Shakspere concentrates the brilliancy\nof the centuries of feudalism on the proud personalities they produced,\nand paints the amorous passion. The books of the Bible stand for the\nfinal superiority of devout emotions over the rest, and of religious\nadoration, and ultimate absolute justice, more powerful than haughtiest\nkings or millionaires or majorities.\n\nWhat the United States are working out and establishing needs\nimperatively the connivance of something subtler than ballots and\nlegislators. The Goethean theory and lesson (if I may briefly state\nit so) of the exclusive sufficiency of artistic, scientific, literary\nequipment to the character, irrespective of any strong claims of the\npolitical ties of nation, state, or city, could have answer'd under the\nconventionality and pettiness of Weimar, or the Germany, or even Europe,\nof those times; but it will not do for America to-day at all. We have\nnot only to exploit our own theory above any that has preceded us, but\nwe have entirely different, and deeper-rooted, and infinitely broader\nthemes.\n\nWhen I have had a chance to see and observe a sufficient crowd of\nAmerican boys or maturer youths or well-grown men, all the States, as in\nmy experiences in the secession war among the soldiers, or west,\neast, north, or south, or my wanderings and loiterings through cities\n(especially New York and in Washington,) I have invariably found coming\nto the front three prevailing personal traits, to be named here for\nbrevity's sake under the heads Good-Nature, Decorum, and Intelligence.\n(I make Good-Nature first, as it deserves to be--it is a splendid\nresultant of all the rest, like health or fine weather.) Essentially\nthese lead the inherent list of the high average personal born and bred\nqualities of the young fellows everywhere through the United States,\nas any sharp observer can find out for himself. Surely these make the\nvertebral stock of superbest and noblest nations! May the destinies show\nit so forthcoming. I mainly confide the whole future of our Commonwealth\nto the fact of these three bases. Need I say I demand the same in the\nelements and spirit and fruitage of National Literature?\n\nAnother, perhaps a born root or branch, comes under the words _Noblesse\nOblige_, even for a national rule or motto. My opinion is that this\nforegoing phrase, and its spirit, should influence and permeate official\nAmerica and its representatives in Congress, the Executive Departments,\nthe Presidency, and the individual States--should be one of their\nchiefest mottoes, and be carried out practically. (I got the idea from\nmy dear friend the democratic Englishwoman, Mrs. Anne Gilchrist, now\ndead. \"The beautiful words _Noblesse Oblige_,\" said she to me once,\n\"are not best for some develop'd gentleman or lord, but some rich and\ndevelop'd nation--and especially for your America.\")\n\nThen another and very grave point (for this discussion is deep,\ndeep--not for trifles, or pretty seemings.) I am not sure but the\nestablish'd and old (and superb and profound, and, one may say, needed\nas old) conception of Deity as mainly of moral constituency (goodness,\npurity, sinlessness, &c.) has been undermined by nineteenth-century\nideas and science. What does this immense and almost abnormal\ndevelopment of Philanthropy mean among the moderns? One doubts if there\never will come a day when the moral laws and moral standards will be\nsupplanted as over all: while time proceeds (I find it so myself) they\nwill probably be intrench'd deeper and expanded wider. Then the expanded\nscientific and democratic and truly philosophic and poetic quality\nof modernism demands a Deific identity and scope superior to all\nlimitations, and essentially including just as well the so-call'd\nevil and crime and criminals--all the malformations, the defective and\nabortions of the universe.\n\nSometimes the bulk of the common people (who are far more 'cute than the\ncritics suppose) relish a well-hidden allusion or hint carelessly dropt,\nfaintly indicated, and left to be disinterr'd or not. Some of the very\nold ballads have delicious morsels of this kind. Greek Aristophanes and\nPindar abounded in them. (I sometimes fancy the old Hellenic audiences\nmust have been as generally keen and knowing as any of their poets.)\nShakspere is full of them. Tennyson has them. It is always a capital\ncompliment from author to reader, and worthy the peering brains of\nAmerica. The mere smartness of the common folks, however, does not need\nencouraging, but qualities more solid and opportune.\n\nWhat are now deepest wanted in the States as roots for their literature\nare Patriotism, Nationality, Ensemble, or the ideas of these, and the\nuncompromising genesis and saturation of these. Not the mere bawling\nand braggadocio of them, but the radical emotion-facts, the fervor and\nperennial fructifying spirit at fountain-head. And at the risk of being\nmisunderstood I should dwell on and repeat that a great imaginative\n_literatus_ for America can never be merely good and moral in the\nconventional method. Puritanism and what radiates from it must always\nbe mention'd by me with respect; then I should say, for this vast and\nvaried Commonwealth, geographically and artistically, the puritanical\nstandards are constipated, narrow, and non-philosophic.\n\nIn the main I adhere to my positions in \"Democratic Vistas,\" and\nespecially to my summing-up of American literature as far as to-day is\nconcern'd. In Scientism, the Medical Profession, Practical Inventions,\nand Journalism, the United States have press'd forward to the glorious\nfront rank of advanced civilized lands, as also in the popular\ndissemination of printed matter (of a superficial nature perhaps, but\nthat is an indispensable preparatory stage,) and have gone in common\neducation, so-call'd, far beyond any other land or age. Yet the\nhigh-pitch'd taunt of Margaret Fuller, forty years ago, still sounds in\nthe air: \"It does not follow, because the United States print and read\nmore books, magazines, and newspapers than all the rest of the world,\nthat they really have therefore a literature.\" For perhaps it is not\nalone the free schools and newspapers, nor railroads and factories,\nnor all the iron, cotton, wheat, pork, and petroleum, nor the gold and\nsilver, nor the surplus of a hundred or several hundred millions, nor\nthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, nor the last national census,\nthat can put this Commonweal high or highest on the cosmical scale of\nhistory. Something else is indispensable. All that record is lofty, but\nthere is a loftier.\n\nThe great current points are perhaps simple, after all: first, that the\nhighest developments of the New World and Democracy, and probably the\nbest society of the civilized world all over, are to be only reach'd\nand spinally nourish'd (in my notion) by a new evolutionary sense and\ntreatment; and, secondly, that the evolution-principle, which is the\ngreatest law through nature, and of course in these States, has now\nreach'd us markedly for and in our literature.\n\nIn other writings I have tried to show how vital to any aspiring\nNationality must ever be its autochthonic song, and how for a really\ngreat people there can be no complete and glorious Name, short of\nemerging out of and even rais'd on such born poetic expression, coming\nfrom its own soil and soul, its area, spread, idiosyncrasies, and (like\nshowers of rain, originally rising impalpably, distill'd from land and\nsea,) duly returning there again. Nor do I forget what we all owe to\nour ancestry; though perhaps we are apt to forgive and bear too much for\nthat alone.\n\nOne part of the national American literatus's task is (and it is not an\neasy one) to treat the old hereditaments, legends, poems, theologies,\nand even customs, with fitting respect and toleration, and at the same\ntime clearly understand and justify, and be devoted to and exploit our\nown day, its diffused light, freedom, responsibilities, with all\nit necessitates, and that our New-World circumstances and stages of\ndevelopment demand and make proper. For American literature we want\nmighty authors, _not_ even Carlyle- and Heine-like, born and brought\nup in (and more or less essentially partaking and giving out) that vast\nabnormal ward or hysterical sick-chamber which in many respects Europe,\nwith all its glories, would seem to be. The greatest feature in current\npoetry (perhaps in literature anyhow) is the almost total lack of\nfirst-class power, and simple, natural health, flourishing and produced\nat first hand, typifying our own era. Modern verse generally lacks quite\naltogether the modern, and is oftener possess'd in spirit with the past\nand feudal, dressed may-be in late fashions. For novels and plays often\nthe plots and surfaces are contemporary--but the spirit, even the fun,\nis morbid and effete.\n\nThere is an essential difference between the Old and New. The poems of\nAsia and Europe are rooted in the long past. They celebrate man and his\nintellections and relativenesses as they have been. But America, in as\nhigh a strain as ever, is to sing them all as they are and are to be. (I\nknow, of course, that the past is probably a main factor in what we are\nand know and must be.) At present the States are absorb'd in business,\nmoney-making, politics, agriculture, the development of mines,\nintercommunications, and other material attents--which all shove forward\nand appear at their height--as, consistently with modern civilization,\nthey must be and should be. Then even these are but the inevitable\nprecedents and providers for home-born, transcendent, democratic\nliterature--to be shown in superior, more heroic, more spiritual, more\nemotional, personalities and songs. A national literature is, of\ncourse, in one sense, a great mirror or reflector. There must however\nbe something before--something to reflect. I should say now, since the\nsecession war, there has been, and to-day unquestionably exists, that\nsomething.\n\nCertainly, anyhow, the United States do not so far utter poetry,\nfirst-rate literature, or any of the so-call'd arts, to any lofty\nadmiration or advantage--are not dominated or penetrated from actual\ninherence or plain bent to the said poetry and arts. Other work, other\nneeds, current inventions, productions, have occupied and to-day mainly\noccupy them. They are very 'cute and imitative and proud--can't\nbear being left too glaringly away far behind the other high-class\nnations--and so we set up some home \"poets,\" \"artists,\" painters,\nmusicians, _literati_, and so forth, all our own (thus claim'd.) The\nwhole matter has gone on, and exists to-day, probably as it should have\nbeen, and should be; as, for the present, it must be. To all which\nwe conclude, and repeat the terrible query: American National\nLiterature--is there distinctively any such thing, or can there ever be?\n\n\nNote:\n\n[46] The essay was for the _North American Review_, in answer to the\nformal request of the editor. It appear'd in March, 1891.\n\n\nGATHERING THE CORN\n\n\n_Last of October_.--Now mellow, crisp, Autumn days, bright moonlight\nnights, and gathering the corn--\"cutting up,\" as the farmers call it.\nNow, or of late, all over the country, a certain green and brown-drab\neloquence seeming to call out, \"You that pretend to give the news, and\nall that's going, why not give us a notice?\" Truly, O fields, as for the\nnotice,\n\n    \"Take, we give it willingly.\"\n\nOnly we must do it our own way. Leaving the domestic, dietary, and\ncommercial parts of the question (which are enormous, in fact, hardly\nsecond to those of any other of our great soil-products), we will just\nsaunter down a lane we know, on an average West Jersey farm, and let the\nfancy of the hour itemize America's most typical agricultural show and\nspecialty.\n\nGathering the Corn--the British call it Maize, the old Yankee farmer\nIndian Corn. The great plumes, the ears well-envelop'd in their husks,\nthe long and pointed leaves, in summer, like green or purple ribands,\nwith a yellow stem line in the middle, all now turn'd dingy; the sturdy\nstalks, and the rustling in the breeze--the breeze itself well tempering\nthe sunny noon--The varied reminiscences recall'd--the ploughing and\nplanting in spring--(the whole family in the field, even the little\ngirls and boys dropping seed in the hill)--the gorgeous sight through\nJuly and August--the walk and observation early in the day--the cheery\ncall of the robin, and the low whirr of insects in the grass--the\nWestern husking party, when ripe--the November moonlight gathering, and\nthe calls, songs, laughter of the young fellows.\n\nNot to forget, hereabouts, in the Middle States, the old worm fences,\nwith the gray rails and their scabs of moss and lichen--those old rails,\nweather beaten, but strong yet. Why not come down from literary dignity,\nand confess we are sitting on one now, under the shade of a great walnut\ntree? Why not confide that these lines are pencill'd on the edge of\na woody bank, with a glistening pond and creek seen through the trees\nsouth, and the corn we are writing about close at hand on the north?\nWhy not put in the delicious scent of the \"life everlasting\" that yet\nlingers so profusely in every direction--the chromatic song of the one\npersevering locust (the insect is scarcer this fall and the past summer\nthan for many years) beginning slowly, rising and swelling to much\nemphasis, and then abruptly falling--so appropriate to the scene, so\nquaint, so racy and suggestive in the warm sunbeams, we could sit here\nand look and listen for an hour? Why not even the tiny, turtle-shaped,\nyellow-back'd, black-spotted lady-bug that has lit on the shirt-sleeve\nof the arm inditing this? Ending our list with the fall-drying grass,\nthe Autumn days themselves,\n\n    Sweet days; so cool, so calm, so bright,\n\n(yet not so cool either, about noon)--the horse-mint, the wild carrot,\nthe mullein, and the bumble-bee.\n\nHow the half-mad vision of William Blake--how the far freer, far firmer\nfantasy that wrote \"Midsummer Night's Dream\"--would have revell'd night\nor day, and beyond stint, in one of our American corn fields! Truly, in\ncolor, outline, material and spiritual suggestiveness, where any more\ninclosing theme for idealist, poet, literary artist?\n\nWhat we have written has been at noon day--but perhaps better still\n(for this collation,) to steal off by yourself these fine nights, and\ngo slowly, musingly down the lane, when the dry and green-gray\nfrost-touch'd leaves seem whisper-gossipping all over the field in\nlow tones, as if every hill had something to say--and you sit or lean\nrecluse near by, and inhale that rare, rich, ripe and peculiar odor\nof the gather'd plant which comes out best only to the night air. The\ncomplex impressions of the far-spread fields and woods in the night, are\nblended mystically, soothingly, indefinitely, and yet palpably to you\n(appealing curiously, perhaps mostly, to the sense of smell.) All is\ncomparative silence and clear-shadow below, and the stars are up there\nwith Jupiter lording it over westward; sulky Saturn in the east, and\nover head the moon. A rare well-shadow'd hour! By no means the least of\nthe eligibilities of the gather'd corn!\n\n\n\n\n\nA DEATH-BOUQUET\n\n_Pick'd Noontime, early January, 1890_\n\n\nDeath--too great a subject to be treated so--indeed the greatest\nsubject--and yet I am giving you but a few random lines about it--as one\nwrites hurriedly the last part of a letter to catch the closing mail.\nOnly I trust the lines, especially the poetic bits quoted, may leave a\nlingering odor of spiritual heroism afterward. For I am probably fond\nof viewing all really great themes indirectly, and by side-ways and\nsuggestions. Certain music from wondrous voices or skilful players--then\npoetic glints still more--put the soul in rapport with death, or toward\nit. Hear a strain from Tennyson's late \"Crossing the Bar\":\n\n    Twilight and evening bell,\n        And after that the dark!\n    And may there be no sadness of farewell,\n        When I embark;\n\n    For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place\n        The floods may bear me far,\n    I hope to see my Pilot face to face\n        When I have crost the bar.\n\nAm I starting the sail-craft of poets in line? Here then a quatrain of\nPhrynichus long ago to one of old Athens' favorites:\n\n    Thrice-happy Sophocles! in good old age,\n    Bless'd as a man, and as a craftsman bless'd,\n    He died; his many tragedies were fair,\n    And fair his end, nor knew he any sorrow.\n\nCertain music, indeed, especially voluntaries by a good player, at\ntwilight--or idle rambles alone by the shore, or over prairie or\non mountain road, for that matter--favor the right mood. Words are\ndifficult--even impossible. No doubt any one will recall ballads or\nsongs or hymns (may-be instrumental performances) that have arous'd\nso curiously, yet definitely, the thought of death, the mystic, the\nafter-realm, as no statement or sermon could--and brought it hovering\nnear. A happy (to call it so) and easy death is at least as much a\nphysiological result as a pyschological one. The foundation of it really\nbegins before birth, and is thence directly or indirectly shaped and\naffected, even constituted, (the base stomachic) by every thing from\nthat minute till the time of its occurrence. And yet here is something\n(Whittier's \"Burning Driftwood\") of an opposite coloring:\n\n    I know the solemn monotone\n        Of waters calling unto me;\n    I know from whence the airs have blown,\n        That whisper of the Eternal Sea;\n    As low my fires of driftwood burn,\n        I hear that sea's deep sounds increase,\n    And, fair in sunset light, discern\n        Its mirage-lifted Isles of Peace.\n\nLike an invisible breeze after a long and sultry day, death sometimes\nsets in at last, soothingly and refreshingly, almost vitally. In not\na few cases the termination even appears to be a sort of ecstasy. Of\ncourse there are painful deaths, but I do not believe such is at all the\ngeneral rule. Of the many hundreds I myself saw die in the fields and\nhospitals during the secession war the cases of mark' d suffering or\nagony _in extremis_ were very rare. (It is a curious suggestion of\nimmortality that the mental and emotional powers remain to their\nclearest through all, while the senses of pain and flesh volition are\nblunted or even gone.)\n\nThen to give the following, and cease before the thought gets\nthreadbare:\n\n    Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!\n    Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)\n    Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,\n    Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,\n    Duly again to port and hawser's tie returning.\n    --But now obey thy cherish'd, secret wish,\n    Embrace thy friends--leave all in order;\n    To port and hawser's tie no more returning,\n    Depart upon thy endless cruise, old Sailor!\n\n\n\n\n\nSOME LAGGARDS YET\n\n\nTHE PERFECT HUMAN VOICE\n\nStating it briefly and pointedly I should suggest that the human voice\nis a cultivation or form'd growth on a fair native foundation. This\nfoundation probably exists in nine cases out of ten. Sometimes nature\naffords the vocal organ in perfection, or rather I would say near enough\nto whet one's appreciation and appetite for a voice that might be truly\ncall'd perfection. To me the grand voice is mainly physiological--(by\nwhich I by no means ignore the mental help, but wish to keep\nthe emphasis where it belongs.) Emerson says _manners_ form the\nrepresentative apex and final charm and captivation of humanity: but he\nmight as well have changed the typicality to voice.\n\nOf course there is much taught and written about elocution, the best\nreading, speaking, &c., but it finally settles down to _best_ human\nvocalization. Beyond all other power and beauty, there is something in\nthe quality and power of the right voice (_timbre_ the schools call\nit) that touches the soul, the abysms. It was not for nothing that\nthe Greeks depended, at their highest, on poetry's and wisdom's vocal\nutterance by _tete-a-tete_ lectures--(indeed all the ancients did.)\n\nOf celebrated people possessing this wonderful vocal power, patent to\nme, in former days, I should specify the contralto Alboni, Elias Hicks,\nFather Taylor, the tenor Bettini, Fanny Kemble, and the old actor Booth,\nand in private life many cases, often women. I sometimes wonder whether\nthe best philosophy and poetry, or something like the best, after all\nthese centuries, perhaps waits to be rous'd out yet, or suggested, by\nthe perfect physiological human voice.\n\n\nSHAKSPERE FOR AMERICA\n\nLet me send you a supplementary word to that \"view\" of Shakspere\nattributed to me, publish'd in your July number,[47] and so courteously\nworded by the reviewer (thanks! dear friend.) But you have left out\nwhat, perhaps, is the main point, as follows:\n\n\"Even the one who at present reigns unquestion'd--of Shakspere--for all\nhe stands for so much in modern literature, he stands entirely for\nthe mighty esthetic sceptres of the past, not for the spiritual and\ndemocratic, the sceptres of the future.\" (See pp. 55-58 in \"November\nBoughs,\" and also some of my further notions on Shakspere.)\n\nThe Old World (Europe and Asia) is the region of the poetry of concrete\nand real things,--the past, the esthetic, palaces, etiquette, the\nliterature of war and love, the mythological gods, and the myths anyhow.\nBut the New World (America) is the region of the future, and its poetry\nmust be spiritual and democratic. Evolution is not the rule in Nature,\nin Politics, and Inventions only, but in Verse. I know our age is\ngreatly materialistic, but it is greatly spiritual, too, and the future\nwill be, too. Even what we moderns have come to mean by _spirituality_\n(while including what the Hebraic utterers, and mainly perhaps all the\nGreek and other old typical poets, and also the later ones, meant) has\nso expanded and color'd and vivified the comprehension of the term,\nthat it is quite a different one from the past. Then science, the final\ncritic of all, has the casting vote for future poetry.\n\n\nNote:\n\n[47] This bit was in \"Poet-lore\" monthly for September, 1890.\n\n\n\"UNASSAIL'D RENOWN\"\n\nThe N. Y. _Critic_, Nov. 24, 1889, propounded a circular to several\npersons, and giving the responses, says, \"Walt Whitman's views [as\nfollow] are, naturally, more radical than those of any other contributor\nto the discussion\":\n\nBriefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct. 19--the question\nwhether I think any American poet not now living deserves a place\namong the thirteen \"English inheritors of unassail'd renown\" (Chaucer,\nSpenser, Shakspere, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth,\nColeridge, Byron, Shelley and Keats,)--and which American poets would be\ntruly worthy, &c. Though to me the _deep_ of the matter goes down,\ndown beneath. I remember the London _Times_ at the time, in opportune,\nprofound and friendly articles on Bryant's and Longfellow's deaths,\nspoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and confusion on America\n(her poets and poetic students) \"coming in possession of a great\nestate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn\"; and the further\ncontingency of \"the English language ever having annex'd to it a lot of\nfirst-class Poetry that would be American, not European\"--proving then\nsomething precious over all, and beyond valuation. But perhaps that\nis venturing outside the question. Of the thirteen British immortals\nmention'd--after placing Shakspere on a sort of pre-eminence of fame not\nto be invaded yet--the names of Bryant, Emerson, Whittier and Longfellow\n(with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or\nother writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an\nequally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that\nglorious list.\n\n\nINSCRIPTION FOR A LITTLE BOOK ON GIORDANO BRUNO\n\nAs America's mental courage (the thought comes to me to-day) is so\nindebted, above all current lands and peoples, to the noble army of\nOld-World martyrs past, how incumbent on us that we clear those martyrs'\nlives and names, and hold them up for reverent admiration, as well\nas beacons. And typical of this, and standing for it and all perhaps,\nGiordano Bruno may well be put, to-day and to come, in our New World's\nthankfulest heart and memory.\n\nW.W. CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _February 24th, 1890_.\n\n\nSPLINTERS\n\nWhile I stand in reverence before the fact of Humanity, the People, I\nwill confess, in writing my L. of G., the least consideration out of\nall that has had to do with it has been the consideration of \"the\npublic\"--at any rate as it now exists. Strange as it may sound for\na democrat to say so, I am clear that no free and original and\nlofty-soaring poem, or one ambitious of those achievements, can\npossibly be fulfill'd by any writer who has largely in his thought _the\npublic_--or the question, What will establish'd literature--What will\nthe current authorities say about it?\n\nAs far as I have sought any, not the best laid out garden or parterre\nhas been my model--but Nature has been. I know that in a sense the\ngarden is nature too, but I had to choose--I could not give both.\nBesides the gardens are well represented in poetry; while Nature (in\nletter and in spirit, in the divine essence,) little if at all.\n\nCertainly, (while I have not hit it by a long shot,) I have aim'd at the\nmost ambitious, the best--and sometimes feel to advance that aim (even\nwith all its arrogance) as the most redeeming part of my books. I have\nnever so much cared to feed the esthetic or intellectual palates--but if\nI could arouse from its slumbers that eligibility in every soul for its\nown true exercise! if I could only wield that lever!\n\nOut from the well-tended concrete and the physical--and in them and from\nthem only--radiate the spiritual and heroic.\n\nUndoubtedly many points belonging to this essay--perhaps of the\ngreatest necessity, fitness and importance to it--have been left out\nor forgotten. But the amount of the whole matter--poems, preface and\neverything--is merely to make one of those little punctures or eyelets\nthe actors possess in the theatre-curtains to look out upon \"the\nhouse\"--one brief, honest, living glance.\n\n\nHEALTH, (OLD STYLE)\n\nIn that condition the whole body is elevated to a state by others\nunknown--inwardly and outwardly illuminated, purified, made solid,\nstrong, yet buoyant. A singular charm, more than beauty, flickers out\nof, and over, the face--a curious transparency beams in the eyes,\nboth in the iris and the white--the temper partakes also. Nothing that\nhappens--no event, rencontre, weather, &c--but it is confronted--nothing\nbut is subdued into sustenance--such is the marvellous transformation\nfrom the old timorousness and the old process of causes and effects.\nSorrows and disappointments cease--there is no more borrowing trouble\nin advance. A man realizes the venerable myth--he is a god walking the\nearth, he sees new eligibilities, powers and beauties everywhere; he\nhimself has a new eyesight and hearing. The play of the body in motion\ntakes a previously unknown grace. Merely _to move_ is then a\nhappiness, a pleasure--to breathe, to see, is also. All the beforehand\ngratifications, drink, spirits, coffee, grease, stimulants, mixtures,\nlate hours, luxuries, deeds of the night, seem as vexatious dreams, and\nnow the awakening;--many fall into their natural places, whole-some,\nconveying diviner joys.\n\nWhat I append--Health, old style--I have long treasur'd--found\noriginally in some scrap-book fifty years ago--a favorite of mine (but\nquite a glaring contrast to my present bodily state:)\n\n    On a high rock above the vast abyss,\n      Whose solid base tumultuous waters lave;\n    Whose airy high-top balmy breezes kiss,\n      Fresh from the white foam of the circling wave--\n\n    There ruddy HEALTH, in rude majestic state,\n      His clust'ring forelock combatting the winds--\n    Bares to each season's change his breast elate,\n      And still fresh vigor from th' encounter finds;\n\n    With mighty mind to every fortune braced,\n      To every climate each corporeal power,\n    And high-proof heart, impenetrably cased,\n      He mocks the quick transitions of the hour.\n\n    Now could he hug bleak Zembla's bolted snow,\n      Now to Arabia's heated deserts turn,\n    Yet bids the biting blast more fiercely blow,\n      The scorching sun without abatement burn.\n\n    There this bold Outlaw, rising with the morn,\n      His sinewy functions fitted for the toil,\n    Pursues, with tireless steps, the rapturous horn,\n      And bears in triumph back the shaggy spoil.\n\n    Or, on his rugged range of towering hills,\n      Turns the stiff glebe behind his hardy team;\n    His wide-spread heaths to blithest measures tills,\n      And boasts the joys of life are not a dream!\n\n    Then to his airy hut, at eve, retires,\n      Clasps to his open breast his buxom spouse,\n    Basks in his faggot's blaze, his passions fires,\n      And strait supine to rest unbroken bows.\n\n    On his smooth forehead, Time's old annual score,\n      Tho' left to furrow, yet disdains to lie;\n    He bids weak sorrow tantalize no more,\n      And puts the cup of care contemptuous by.\n\n    If, from some inland height, that, skirting, bears\n      Its rude encroachments far into the vale,\n    He views where poor dishonor'd nature wears\n      On her soft cheek alone the lily pale;\n\n    How will he scorn alliance with the race,\n      Those aspen shoots that shiver at a breath;\n    Children of sloth, that danger dare not face,\n      And find in life but an extended death:\n\n    Then from the silken reptiles will he fly,\n      To the bold cliff in bounding transports run,\n    And stretch'd o'er many a wave his ardent eye,\n      Embrace the enduring Sea-Boy as his son!\n\n    Yes! thine alone--from pain, from sorrow free,\n      The lengthen'd life with peerless joys replete;\n    Then let me, Lord of Mountains, share with thee\n      The hard, the early toil--the relaxation sweet.\n\n\nGAY-HEARTEDNESS\n\nWalking on the old Navy Yard bridge, Washington, D. C., once with a\ncompanion, Mr. Marshall, from England, a great traveler and observer, as\na squad of laughing young black girls pass'd us--then two copper-color'd\nboys, one good-looking lad 15 or 16, barefoot, running after--\"What _gay\ncreatures_ they all appear to be,\" said Mr. M. Then we fell to talking\nabout the general lack of buoyant animal spirits. \"I think,\" said Mr.\nM., \"that in all my travels, and all my intercourse with people of\nevery and any class, especially the cultivated ones, (the literary and\nfashionable folks,) I have never yet come across what I should call a\nreally GAY-HEARTED MAN.\"\n\nIt was a terrible criticism--cut into me like a surgeon's lance. Made me\nsilent the whole walk home.\n\n\nAS IN A SWOON.\n\n    As in a swoon, one instant,\n    Another sun, ineffable, full-dazzles me,\n    And all the orbs I knew--and brighter, unknown orbs;\n    One instant of the future land, Heaven's land.\n\n\nL. OF G.\n\n    Thoughts, suggestions, aspirations, pictures,\n    Cities and farms--by day and night--book of peace and war,\n    Of platitudes and of the commonplace.\n\n    For out-door health, the land and sea--for good will,\n    For America--for all the earth, all nations, the common people,\n    (Not of one nation only--not America only.)\n\n    In it each claim, ideal, line, by all lines, claims, ideals,\n      temper'd;\n    Each right and wish by other wishes, rights.\n\n\nAFTER THE ARGUMENT.\n\n    A group of little children with their ways and chatter flow in,\n    Like welcome rippling water o'er my heated nerves and flesh.\n\n\nFOR US TWO, READER DEAR.\n\n    Simple, spontaneous, curious, two souls interchanging,\n    With the original testimony for us continued to the last.\n\n\n\n\nMEMORANDA\n\n\n[Let me indeed turn upon myself a little of the light I have been so\nfond of casting on others.\n\nOf course these few exceptional later mems are far, far short of one's\nconcluding history or thoughts or life-giving--only a hap-hazard pinch\nof all. But the old Greek proverb put it, \"Anybody who really has a good\nquality\" (or bad one either, I guess) \"has _all_.\" There's something in\nthe proverb; but you mustn't carry it too far.\n\nI will not reject any theme or subject because the treatment is too\npersonal.\n\nAs my stuff settles into shape, I am told (and sometimes myself\ndiscover, uneasily, but feel all right about it in calmer moments) it\nis mainly autobiographic, and even egotistic after all--which I finally\naccept, and am contented so.\n\nIf this little volume betrays, as it doubtless does, a weakening\nhand, and decrepitude, remember it is knit together out of accumulated\nsickness, inertia, physical disablement, acute pain, and listlessness.\nMy fear will be that at last my pieces show indooredness, and being\nchain'd to a chair--as never before. Only the resolve to keep up, and\non, and to add a remnant, and even perhaps obstinately see what failing\npowers and decay may contribute too, have produced it.\n\nAnd now as from some fisherman's net hauling all sorts, and disbursing\nthe same.]\n\n\nA WORLD'S SHOW\n\n_New York, Great Exposition open'd in 1853._--I went a long time (nearly\na year)--days and nights--especially the latter--as it was finely\nlighted, and had a very large and copious exhibition gallery of\npaintings (shown at best at night, I tho't)--hundreds of pictures from\nEurope, many masterpieces--all an exhaustless study--and, scatter'd\nthro' the building, sculptures, single figures or groups--among the\nrest, Thorwaldsen's \"Apostles,\" colossal in size--and very many fine\nbronzes, pieces of plate from English silversmiths, and curios from\neverywhere abroad--with woods from all lands of the earth--all sorts of\nfabrics and products and handiwork from the workers of all nations.\n\n\nNEW YORK--THE BAY--THE OLD NAME\n\n_Commencement of a gossipy travelling letter in a New York city paper,\nMay 10, 1879_.--My month's visit is about up; but before I get back to\nCamden let me print some jottings of the last four weeks. Have you not,\nreader dear, among your intimate friends, some one, temporarily absent,\nwhose letters to you, avoiding all the big topics and disquisitions,\ngive only minor, gossipy sights and scenes--just as they come--subjects\ndisdain'd by solid writers, but interesting to you because they were\nsuch as happen to everybody, and were the moving entourage to your\nfriend--to his or her steps, eyes, mentality? Well, with an idea\nsomething of that kind, I suppose, I set out on the following\nhurrygraphs of a breezy early-summer visit to New York city and up the\nNorth river--especially at present of some hours along Broadway.\n\n_What I came to New York for_.--To try the experiment of a lecture--to\nsee whether I could stand it, and whether an audience could--was my\nspecific object. Some friends had invited me--it was by no means clear\nhow it would end--I stipulated that they should get only a third-rate\nhall, and not sound the advertising trumpets a bit--and so I started. I\nmuch wanted something to do for occupation, consistent with my limping\nand paralyzed state. And now, since it came off, and since neither my\nhearers nor I myself really collaps'd at the aforesaid lecture, I intend\nto go up and down the land (in moderation,) seeking whom I may devour,\nwith lectures, and reading of my own poems--short pulls, however--never\nexceeding an hour.\n\n_Crossing from Jersey city, 5 to 6 P.M._--The city part of the North\nriver with its life, breadth, peculiarities--the amplitude of sea and\nwharf, cargo and commerce--one don't realize them till one has been\naway a long time and, as now returning, (crossing from Jersey city to\nDesbrosses-st.,) gazes on the unrivall'd panorama, and far down the\nthin-vapor'd vistas of the bay, toward the Narrows--or northward up the\nHudson--or on the ample spread and infinite variety, free and floating,\nof the more immediate views--a countless river series--everything\nmoving, yet so easy, and such plenty of room! Little, I say, do folks\nhere appreciate the most ample, eligible, picturesque bay and estuary\nsurroundings in the world! This is the third time such a conviction\nhas come to me after absence, returning to New York, dwelling on its\nmagnificent entrances--approaching the city by them from any point.\n\nMore and more, too, the _old name_ absorbs into me--MANNAHATTA, \"the\nplace encircled by many swift tides and sparkling waters.\" How fit a\nname for America's great democratic island city! The word itself,\nhow beautiful! how aboriginal! how it seems to rise with tall spires,\nglistening in sunshine, with such New World atmosphere, vista and\naction!\n\n\nA SICK SPELL\n\n_Christmas Day, 25th Dec., 1888_.--Am somewhat easier and freer to-day\nand the last three days--sit up most of the time--read and write, and\nreceive my visitors. Have now been in-doors sick for seven months--half\nof the time bad, bad, vertigo, indigestion, bladder, gastric, head\ntrouble, inertia--Dr. Bucke, Dr. Osler, Drs. Wharton and Walsh--now\nEdward Wilkins my help and nurse. A fine, splendid, sunny day. My\n\"November Boughs\" is printed and out; and my \"Complete Works, Poems and\nProse,\" a big volume, 900 pages, also. It is ab't noon, and I sit here\npretty comfortable.\n\n\nTO BE PRESENT ONLY\n\n_At the Complimentary Dinner, Camden, New Jersey, May 31, 1889_.--Walt\nWhitman said: My friends, though announced to give an address, there\nis no such intention. Following the impulse of the spirit, (for I am at\nleast half of Quaker stock) I have obey'd the command to come and look\nat you, for a minute, and show myself, face to face; which is probably\nthe best I can do. But I have felt no command to make a speech;\nand shall not therefore attempt any. All I have felt the imperative\nconviction to say I have already printed in my books of poems or prose;\nto which I refer any who may be curious. And so, hail and farewell.\nDeeply acknowledging this deep compliment, with my best respects and\nlove to you personally--to Camden--to New-Jersey, and to all represented\nhere--you must excuse me from any word further.\n\n\n\"INTESTINAL AGITATION\"\n\n_From Pall-Mall Gazette, London, England, Feb 8, 1890_ Mr. Ernest\nRhys has just receiv'd an interesting letter from Walt Whitman, dated\n\"Camden, January 22, 1890.\" The following is an extract from it:\n\nI am still here--no very mark'd or significant change or\nhappening--fairly buoyant spirits, &c.--but surely, slowly ebbing. At\nthis moment sitting here, in my den, Mickle street, by the oakwood fire,\nin the same big strong old chair with wolf-skin spread over back--bright\nsun, cold, dry winter day. America continues--is generally busy enough\nall over her vast demesnes (intestinal agitation I call it,) talking,\nplodding, making money, every one trying to get on--perhaps to get\ntowards the top--but no special individual signalism--(just as well, I\nguess.)\n\n\n\"WALT WHITMAN'S LAST 'PUBLIC'\"\n\nThe gay and crowded audience at the Art Rooms, Philadelphia, Tuesday\nnight, April 15, 1890, says a correspondent of the Boston _Transcript_,\nApril 19, might not have thought that W. W. crawl'd out of a sick bed a\nfew hours before, crying,\n\n    Dangers retreat when boldly they're confronted,\n\nand went over, hoarse and half blind, to deliver his memoranda and essay\non the death of Abraham Lincoln, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of that\ntragedy. He led off with the following new paragraph:\n\n\"Of Abraham Lincoln, bearing testimony twenty-five years after his\ndeath--and of that death--I am now my friends before you. Few realize\nthe days, the great historic and esthetic personalities, with him in\nthe centre, we pass'd through. Abraham Lincoln, familiar, our own, an\nIllinoisian, modern, yet tallying ancient Moses, Joshua, Ulysses, or\nlater Cromwell, and grander in some respects than any of them; Abraham\nLincoln, that makes the like of Homer, Plutarch, Shakspere, eligible our\nday or any day. My subject this evening for forty or fifty minutes' talk\nis the death of this man, and how that death will really filter into\nAmerica. I am not going to tell you anything new; and it is doubtless\nnearly altogether because I ardently wish to commemorate the hour and\nmartyrdom and name I am here. Oft as the rolling years bring back this\nhour, let it again, however briefly, be dwelt upon. For my own part I\nhope and intend till my own dying day, whenever the 14th and 15th\nof April comes, to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic\nreminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence. It belongs to these\nStates in their entirety--not the North only, but the South--perhaps\nbelongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South, of all; for there\nreally this man's birthstock; there and then his antecedent stamp. Why\nshould I not say that thence his manliest traits, his universality,\nhis canny, easy ways and words upon the surface--his inflexible\ndetermination at heart? Have you ever realized it, my friends, that\nLincoln, though grafted on the West, is essentially in personnel and\ncharacter a Southern contribution?\"\n\nThe most of the poet's address was devoted to the actual occurrences and\ndetails of the murder. We believe the delivery on Tuesday was Whitman's\nthirteenth of it. The old poet is now physically wreck'd. But his voice\nand magnetism are the same. For the last month he has been under\na severe attack of the lately prevailing influenza, the grip, in\naccumulation upon his previous ailments, and, above all, that terrible\nparalysis, the bequest of secession war times. He was dress'd last\nTuesday night in an entire suit of French Canadian grey wool cloth, with\nbroad shirt collar, with no necktie; long white hair, red face, full\nbeard and moustache, and look'd as though he might weigh two hundred\npounds. He had to be help'd and led every step. In five weeks more he\nwill begin his seventy-second year. He is still writing a little.\n\n\nINGERSOLL'S SPEECH\n\n_From the Camden Post, N.J., June 2, 1890_ _He attends and makes a\nspeech at the celebration of Walt Whitman's birthday_.--Walt Whitman\nis now in his seventy-second year. His younger friends, literary and\npersonal, men and women, gave him a complimentary supper last Saturday\nnight, to note the close of his seventy-first year, and the late curious\nand unquestionable \"boom\" of the old man's wide-spreading popularity,\nand that of his \"Leaves of Grass.\" There were thirty-five in the room,\nmostly young, but some old, or beginning to be. The great feature was\nIngersoll's utterance. It was probably, in its way, the most admirable\nspecimen of modern oratory hitherto delivered in the English language,\nimmense as such praise may sound. It was 40 to 50 minutes long,\naltogether without notes, in a good voice, low enough and not too low,\nstyle easy, rather colloquial (over and over again saying \"you\" to\nWhitman who sat opposite,) sometimes markedly impassion'd, once or\ntwice humorous--amid his whole speech, from interior fires and volition,\npulsating and swaying like a first-class Andalusian dancer.\n\nAnd such a critical dissection, and flattering summary! The Whitmanites\nfor the first time in their lives were fully satisfied; and that is\nsaying a good deal, for they have not put their claims low, by a long\nshot. Indeed it was a tremendous talk! Physically and mentally Ingersoll\n(he had been working all day in New York, talking in court and in his\noffice,) is now at his best, like mellow'd wine, or a just ripe\napple; to the artist-sense, too, looks at his best--not merely like a\nbequeath'd Roman bust or fine smooth marble Cicero-head, or even Greek\nPlato; for he is modern and vital and vein'd and American, and (far more\nthan the age knows,) justifies us all.\n\nWe cannot give a full report of this most remarkable talk and supper\n(which was curiously conversational and Greek-like) but must add the\nfollowing significant bit of it.\n\nAfter the speaking, and just before the close, Mr. Whitman reverted to\nColonel Ingersoll's tribute to his poems, pronouncing it the capsheaf\nof all commendation that he had ever receiv'd. Then, his mind still\ndwelling upon the Colonel's religious doubts, he went on to say that\nwhat he himself had in his mind when he wrote \"Leaves of Grass\" was not\nonly to depict American life, as it existed, and to show the triumphs of\nscience, and the poetry in common things, and the full of an individual\ndemocratic humanity, for the aggregate, but also to show that there\nwas behind all something which rounded and completed it. \"For what,\"\nhe ask'd, \"would this life be without immortality? It would be as a\nlocomotive, the greatest triumph of modern science, with no train to\ndraw after it. If the spiritual is not behind the material, to what\npurpose is the material? What is this world without a further Divine\npurpose in it all?\"\n\nColonel Ingersoll repeated his former argument in reply.\n\n\nFEELING FAIRLY\n\n_Friday, July 27, 1890_.--Feeling fairly these days, and even\njovial--sleep and appetite good enough to be thankful for--had a dish\nof Maryland blackberries, some good rye bread and a cup of tea, for\nmy breakfast--relish' d all--fine weather--bright sun to-day--pleasant\nnorthwest breeze blowing in the open window as I sit here in my big\nrattan chair--two great fine roses (white and red, blooming, fragrant,\nsent by mail by W. S. K. and wife, Mass.) are in a glass of water on the\ntable before me.\n\nAm now in my 72d year.\n\n\nOLD BROOKLYN DAYS\n\nIt must have been in 1822 or '3 that I first came to live in Brooklyn.\nLived first in Front street, not far from what was then call'd \"the New\nFerry,\" wending the river from the foot of Catharine (or Main) street to\nNew York city.\n\nI was a little child (was born in 1819,) but tramp'd freely about the\nneighborhood and town, even then; was often on the aforesaid New\nFerry; remember how I was petted and deadheaded by the gatekeepers and\ndeckhands (all such fellows are kind to little children,) and remember\nthe horses that seem'd to me so queer as they trudg'd around in the\ncentral houses of the boats, making the water-power. (For it was just\non the eve of the steam-engine, which was soon after introduced on the\nferries.) Edward Copeland (afterward Mayor) had a grocery store then at\nthe corner of Front and Catharine streets.\n\nPresently we Whitmans all moved up to Tillary street, near Adams, where\nmy father, who was a carpenter, built a house for himself and us all. It\nwas from here I \"assisted\" the personal coming of Lafayette in 1824-'5\nto Brooklyn. He came over the Old Ferry, as the now Fulton Ferry (partly\nnavigated quite up to that day by \"horse boats,\" though the first\nsteamer had begun to be used hereabouts) was then call'd, and was\nreceiv'd at the foot of Fulton street. It was on that occasion that the\ncorner-stone of the Apprentices' Library, at the corner of Cranberry\nand Henry streets--since pull'd down--was laid by Lafayette's own hands.\nNumerous children arrived on the grounds, of whom I was one, and were\nassisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony. Among\nothers, Lafayette, also helping the children, took me up--I was five\nyears old, press'd me a moment to his breast--gave me a kiss and set me\ndown in a safe spot. Lafayette was at that time between sixty-five and\nseventy years of age, with a manly figure and a kind face.\n\n\nTWO QUESTIONS\n\nAn editor of (or in) a leading monthly magazine (\"Harper's Monthly,\"\nJuly, 1890,) asks: \"A hundred years from now will W.W. be popularly\nrated a great poet--or will he be forgotten?\" ... A mighty ticklish\nquestion--which can only be left for a hundred years hence--perhaps more\nthan that. But whether W.W. has been mainly rejected by his own times is\nan easier question to answer.\n\nAll along from 1860 to '91, many of the pieces in L. of G., and its\nannexes, were first sent to publishers or magazine editors before being\nprinted in the L., and were peremptorily rejected by them, and sent back\nto their author. The \"Eidolons\" was sent back by Dr. H., of \"Scribner's\nMonthly\" with a lengthy, very insulting and contemptuous letter. \"To\nthe Sun-Set Breeze,\" was rejected by the editor of \"Harper's Monthly\" as\nbeing \"an improvisation\" only. \"On, on ye jocund twain\" was rejected\nby the \"Century\" editor as being personal merely. Several of the pieces\nwent the rounds of all the monthlies, to be thus summarily rejected.\n\n_June, '90_.--The----rejects and sends back my little poem, so I am now\nset out in the cold by every big magazine and publisher, and may as well\nunderstand and admit it--which is just as well, for I find I am palpably\nlosing my sight and ratiocination.\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n_To a volume of essays and tales by Wm. D. O'Connor, pub'd posthumously\nin 1891_\n\nA hasty memorandum, not particularly for Preface to the following tales,\nbut to put on record my respect and affection for as sane, beautiful,\ncute, tolerant, loving, candid and free and fair-intention'd a nature as\never vivified our race.\n\nIn Boston, 1860, I first met William Douglas O'Connor.[48] As I saw\nand knew him then, in his 29th year, and for twenty-five further\nyears along, he was a gallant, handsome, gay-hearted, fine-voiced,\nglowing-eyed man; lithe-moving on his feet, of healthy and magnetic\natmosphere and presence, and the most welcome company in the world.\nHe was a thorough-going anti-slavery believer, speaker and writer,\n(doctrinaire,) and though I took a fancy to him from the first. I\nremember I fear'd his ardent abolitionism--was afraid it would probably\nkeep us apart. (I was a decided and out-spoken anti-slavery believer\nmyself, then and always; but shy'd from the extremists, the red-hot\nfellows of those times.) O'C. was then correcting the proofs of\n_Harrington_, an eloquent and fiery novel he had written, and which\nwas printed just before the commencement of the secession war. He\nwas already married, the father of two fine little children, and was\npersonally and intellectually the most attractive man I had ever met.\n\nLast of '62 I found myself led towards the war-field--went to Washington\ncity--(to become absorb'd in the armies, and in the big hospitals, and\nto get work in one of the Departments,)--and there I met and resumed\nfriendship, and found warm hospitality from O'C. and his noble New\nEngland wife. They had just lost by death their little child-boy,\nPhillip; and O'C. was yet feeling serious about it. The youngster had\nbeen vaccinated against the threatening of small-pox which alarm'd the\ncity; but somehow it led to worse results than it was intended to ward\noff--or at any rate O'C. thought that proved the cause of the boy's\ndeath. He had one child left, a fine bright little daughter, and a great\ncomfort to her parents. (Dear Jeannie! She grew up a most accomplish'd\nand superior young woman--declined in health, and died about 1881.)\n\nOn through for months and years to '73 I saw and talk'd with O'C. almost\ndaily. I had soon got employment, first for a short time in the Indian\nBureau (in the Interior Department,) and then for a long while in the\nAttorney General's Office. The secession war, with its tide of varying\nfortunes, excitements--President Lincoln and the daily sight of him--the\ndoings in Congress and at the State Capitols--the news from the fields\nand campaigns, and from foreign governments--my visits to the Army\nHospitals, daily and nightly, soon absorbing everything else,--with a\nhundred matters, occurrences, personalties,--(Greeley, Wendell Phillips,\nthe parties, the Abolitionists, &c.)--were the subjects of our talk and\ndiscussion. I am not sure from what I heard then, but O'C. was cut out\nfor a first-class public speaker or forensic advocate. No audience\nor jury could have stood out against him. He had a strange charm of\nphysiologic voice. He had a power and sharp-cut faculty of statement and\npersuasiveness beyond any man's else. I know it well, for I have felt\nit many a time. If not as orator, his forte was as critic, newer, deeper\nthan any: also, as literary author. One of his traits was that while he\nknew all, and welcom'd all sorts of great _genre_ literature, all lands\nand times, from all writers and artists, and not only tolerated\neach, and defended every attack'd literary person with a skill or\nheart-catholicism that I never saw equal'd--invariably advocated and\nexcused them--he kept an idiosyncrasy and identity of his own very\nmark'd, and without special tinge or undue color from any source. He\nalways applauded the freedom of the masters, whence and whoever. I\nremember his special defences of Byron, Burns, Poe, Rabelais, Victor\nHugo, George Sand, and others. There was always a little touch of\npensive cadence in his superb voice; and I think there was something\nof the same sadness in his temperament and nature. Perhaps, too, in\nhis literary structure. But he was a very buoyant, jovial, good-natured\ncompanion.\n\nSo much for a hasty melanged reminiscence and note of William O'Connor,\nmy dear, dear friend, and staunch, (probably my staunchest) literary\nbeliever and champion from the first, and throughout without halt or\ndemur, for twenty-five years. No better friend--none more reliable\nthrough this life of one's ups and downs. On the occurrence of the\nlatter he would be sure to make his appearance on the scene, eager,\nhopeful, full of fight like a perfect knight of chivalry. For he was a\nborn sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden\ntime first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory! W. W.\n\n\nNote: [48] Born Jan. 2d, 1832. When grown, lived several years in\nBoston, and edited journals and magazines there--went about 1861 to\nWashington, D. C., and became a U.S. clerk, first in the Light-House\nBureau, and then in the U.S. Life-Saving Service, in which branch he was\nAssistant Superintendent for many years--sicken'd in 1887--died there at\nWashington, May 9th, 1889.\n\n\nAN ENGINEER'S OBITUARY\n\n_From the Engineering Record, New York, Dec. 13, 1890_\n\nThomas Jefferson Whitman was born July 18, 1833, in Brooklyn, N. Y.,\nfrom a father of English Stock, and mother (Louisa Van Velsor) descended\nfrom Dutch (Holland) immigration. His early years were spent on Long\nIsland, either in the country or Brooklyn. As a lad he show'd a tendency\nfor surveying and civil engineering, and about at 19 went with Chief\nKirkwood, who was then prospecting and outlining for the great city\nwater-works. He remain'd at that construction throughout, was a favorite\nand confidant of the Chief, and was successively promoted. He continued\nalso under Chief Moses Lane. He married in 1859, and not long after was\ninvited by the Board of Public Works of St. Louis, Missouri, to come\nthere and plan and build a new and fitting water-works for that great\ncity. Whitman accepted the call, and moved and settled there, and had\nbeen a resident of St. Louis ever since. He plann'd and built the works,\nwhich were very successful, and remain'd as super-intendent and chief\nfor nearly 20 years.\n\nOf the last six years he has been largely occupied as consulting\nengineer (divested of his cares and position in St. Louis,) and\nhas engaged in public constructions, bridges, sewers, &c., West and\nSouthwest, and especially the Memphis, Tenn., city water-works.\n\nThomas J. Whitman was a theoretical and practical mechanic of superior\norder, founded in the soundest personal and professional integrity. He\nwas a great favorite among the young engineers and students; not a few\nof them yet remaining in Kings and Queens counties, and New York city,\nwill remember \"Jeff,\" with old-time good-will and affection. He was\nmostly self-taught, and was a hard student.\n\nHe had been troubled of late years from a bad throat and from gastric\naffection, tending on typhoid, and had been rather seriously ill with\nthe last malady, but was getting over the worst of it, when he succumb'd\nunder a sudden and severe attack of the heart. He died at St. Louis,\nNovember 25, 1890, in his 58th year. Of his family, the wife died in\n1873, and a daughter, Mannahatta, died two years ago. Another daughter,\nJessie Louisa, the only child left, is now living in St. Louis.\n\n[When Jeff was born I was in my 15th year, and had much care of him for\nmany years afterward, and he did not separate from me. He was a very\nhandsome, healthy, affectionate, smart child, and would sit on my lap\nor hang on my neck half an hour at a time. As he grew a big boy he liked\noutdoor and water sports, especially boating. We would often go down\nsummers to Peconic Bay, east end of Long Island, and over to Shelter\nIsland. I loved long rambles, and he carried his fowling-piece. O,\nwhat happy times, weeks! Then in Brooklyn and New York city he learn'd\nprinting, and work'd awhile at it; but eventually (with my approval) he\nwent to employment at land surveying, and merged in the studies and work\nof topographical engineer; this satisfied him, and he continued at it.\nHe was of noble nature from the first; very good-natured, very plain,\nvery friendly. O, how we loved each other--how many jovial good times we\nhad! Once we made a long trip from New York city down over the Allegheny\nmountains (the National Road) and via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,\nfrom Cairo to New Orleans.]\n\nGod's blessing on your name and memory, dear brother Jeff!\n\nW. W.\n\n\nOLD ACTORS, SINGERS, SHOWS, &C., IN NEW YORK\n\n_Flitting mention--(with much left out)_\n\nSeems to me I ought acknowledge my debt to actors, singers, public\nspeakers, conventions, and the Stage in New York, my youthful days,\nfrom 1835 onward--say to '60 or '61--and to plays and operas generally.\n(Which nudges a pretty big disquisition: of course it should be all\nelaborated and penetrated more deeply--but I will here give only some\nflitting mentionings of my youth.) Seems to me now when I look back, the\nItalian contralto Marietta Alboni (she is living yet, in Paris, 1891,\nin good condition, good voice yet, considering) with the then prominent\nhistrions Booth, Edwin Forrest, and Fanny Kemble and the Italian singer\nBettini, have had the deepest and most lasting effect upon me. I should\nlike well if Madame Alboni and the old composer Verdi, (and Bettini the\ntenor, if he is living) could know how much noble pleasure and happiness\nthey gave me, and how deeply I always remember them and thank them\nto this day. For theatricals in literature and doubtless upon me\npersonally, including opera, have been of course serious factors. (The\nexperts and musicians of my present friends claim that the new Wagner\nand his pieces belong far more truly to me, and I to them, likely. But\nI was fed and bred under the Italian dispensation, and absorb'd it, and\ndoubtless show it.)\n\nAs a young fellow, when possible I always studied a play or libretto\nquite carefully over, by myself, (sometimes twice through) before\nseeing it on the stage; read it the day or two days before. Tried both\nways--not reading some beforehand; but I found I gain'd most by getting\nthat sort of mastery first, if the piece had depth. (Surface effects and\nglitter were much less thought of, I am sure, those times.) There were\nmany fine old plays, neither tragedies nor comedies--the names of them\nquite unknown to to-day's current audiences. \"All is not Gold that\nGlitters,\" in which Charlotte Cushman had a superbly enacted part, was\nof that kind. C. C., who revel'd in them, was great in such pieces; I\nthink better than in the heavy popular roles.\n\nWe had some fine music those days. We had the English opera of\n\"Cinderella\" (with Henry Placide as the pompous old father, an\nunsurpassable bit of comedy and music.) We had Bombastes Furioso.\nMust have been in 1844 (or '5) I saw Charles Kean and Mrs. Kean (Ellen\nTree)--saw them in the Park in Shakspere's \"King John.\" He, of course,\nwas the chief character. She play'd _Queen Constance._ Tom Hamblin was\n_Faulconbridge,_ and probably the best ever on the stage. It was an\nimmense show-piece, too; lots of grand set scenes and fine armor-suits\nand all kinds of appointments imported from London (where it had been\nfirst render'd.) The large brass bands--the three or four hundred\n\"supes\"--the interviews between the French and English armies--the\ntalk with _Hubert_ (and the hot irons) the delicious acting of _Prince\nArthur_ (Mrs. Richardson, I think)--and all the fine blare and court\npomp--I remember to this hour. The death-scene of the King in the\norchard of Swinstead Abbey, was very effective. Kean rush'd in,\ngray-pale and yellow, and threw himself on a lounge in the open. His\npangs were horribly realistic. (He must have taken lessons in some\nhospital.)\n\nFanny Kemble play'd to wonderful effect in such pieces as \"Fazio, or the\nItalian wife.\" The turning-point was jealousy. It was a rapid-running,\nyet heavy-timber'd, tremendous wrenching, passionate play. Such old\npieces always seem'd to me built like an ancient ship of the line, solid\nand lock'd from keel up--oak and metal and knots. One of the finest\ncharacters was a great court lady, _Aldabella_, enacted by Mrs. Sharpe.\nO how it all entranced us, and knock'd us about, as the scenes swept on\nlike a cyclone!\n\nSaw Hackett at the old Park many times, and remember him well. His\nrenderings were first-rate in everything. He inaugurated the true \"Rip\nVan Winkle,\" and look'd and acted and dialogued it to perfection (he was\nof Dutch breed, and brought up among old Holland descendants in Kings\nand Queens counties, Long Island.) The play and the acting of it have\nbeen adjusted to please popular audiences since; but there was in that\noriginal performance certainly something of a far higher order, more\nart, more reality, more resemblance, a bit of fine pathos, a lofty\n_brogue_, beyond anything afterward.\n\nOne of my big treats was the rendering at the old Park of Shakspere's\n\"Tempest\" in musical version. There was a very fine instrumental band,\nnot numerous, but with a capital leader. Mrs. Austin was the _Ariel_,\nand Peter Richings the _Caliban_; both excellent. The drunken song of\nthe latter has probably been never equal'd. The perfect actor Clarke\n(old Clarke) was _Prospero_.\n\nYes; there were in New York and Brooklyn some fine non-technical singing\nperformances, concerts, such as the Hutchinson band, three brothers, and\nthe sister, the red-cheek'd New England carnation, sweet Abby; sometimes\nplaintive and balladic--sometimes anti-slavery, anti-calomel, and comic.\nThere were concerts by Templeton, Russell, Dempster, the old Alleghanian\nband, and many others. Then we had lots of \"negro minstrels,\" with\ncapital character songs and voices. I often saw Rice the original \"Jim\nCrow\" at the old Park Theatre filling up the gap in some short bill--and\nthe wild chants and dances were admirable--probably ahead of anything\nsince. Every theatre had some superior voice, and it was common to\ngive a favorite song between the acts. \"The Sea\" at the bijou Olympic,\n(Broadway near Grand,) was always welcome from a little Englishman named\nEdwin, a good balladist. At the Bowery the loves of \"Sweet William,\"\n\n    \"When on the Downs the fleet was moor'd,\"\n\nalways bro't an encore, and sometimes a treble.\n\nI remember Jenny Lind and heard her (1850 I think) several times.\nShe had the most brilliant, captivating, popular musical style and\nexpression of any one known; (the canary, and several other sweet\nbirds are wondrous fine--but there is something in song that goes\ndeeper--isn't there?)\n\nThe great \"Egyptian Collection\" was well up in Broadway, and I got quite\nacquainted with Dr. Abbott, the proprietor--paid many visits there, and\nhad long talks with him, in connection with my readings of many books\nand reports on Egypt--its antiquities, history, and how things and the\nscenes really look, and what the old relics stand for, as near as we can\nnow get. (Dr. A. was an Englishman of say 54--had been settled in\nCairo as physician for 25 years, and all that time was collecting these\nrelics, and sparing no time or money seeking and getting them. By advice\nand for a change of base for himself, he brought the collection to\nAmerica. But the whole enterprise was a fearful disappointment, in the\npay and commercial part.) As said, I went to the Egyptian Museum many\nmany times; sometimes had it all to myself--delved at the formidable\ncatalogue--and on several occasions had the invaluable personal talk,\ncorrection, illustration and guidance of Dr. A. himself. He was very\nkind and helpful to me in those studies and examinations; once, by\nappointment, he appear'd in full and exact Turkish (Cairo) costume,\nwhich long usage there had made habitual to him.\n\nOne of the choice places of New York to me then was the \"Phrenological\nCabinet\" of Fowler & Wells, Nassau street near Beekman. Here were all\nthe busts, examples, curios and books of that study obtainable. I went\nthere often, and once for myself had a very elaborate and leisurely\nexamination and \"chart of bumps\" written out (I have it yet,) by Nelson\nFowler (or was it Sizer?) there.\n\nAnd who remembers the renown'd New York \"Tabernacle\" of those days\n\"before the war\"? It was on the east side of Broadway, near Pearl\nstreet--was a great turtle-shaped hall, and you had to walk back from\nthe street entrance thro' a long wide corridor to get to it--was very\nstrong--had an immense gallery--altogether held three or four thousand\npeople. Here the huge annual conventions of the windy and cyclonic\n\"reformatory societies\" of those times were held--especially the\ntumultuous Anti-Slavery ones. I remember hearing Wendell Phillips,\nEmerson, Cassius Clay, John P. Hale, Beecher, Fred Douglas, the\nBurleighs, Garrison, and others. Sometimes the Hutchinsons would\nsing--very fine. Sometimes there were angry rows. A chap named Isaiah\nRhynders, a fierce politician of those days, with a band of robust\nsupporters, would attempt to contradict the speakers and break up\nthe meetings. But the Anti-Slavery, and Quaker, and Temperance, and\nMissionary and other conventicles and speakers were tough, tough, and\nalways maintained their ground, and carried out their programs fully.\nI went frequently to these meetings, May after May--learn'd much from\nthem--was sure to be on hand when J. P. Hale or Cash Clay made speeches.\n\nThere were also the smaller and handsome halls of the Historical and\nAthensum Societies up on Broadway. I very well remember W.C. Bryant\nlecturing on Homoeopathy in one of them, and attending two or three\naddresses by R.W. Emerson in the other.\n\nThere was a series of plays and dramatic _genre_ characters by a\ngentleman bill'd as Ranger--very fine, better than merely technical,\nfull of exquisite shades, like the light touches of the violin in the\nhands of a master. There was the actor Anderson, who brought us Gerald\nGriffin's \"Gysippus,\" and play'd it to admiration. Among the actors of\nthose times I recall: Cooper, Wallack, Tom Hamblin, Adams (several), Old\nGates, Scott, Wm. Sefton, John Sefton, Geo. Jones, Mitchell, Seguin,\nOld Clarke, Richings, Fisher, H. Placide, T. Placide, Thorne, Ingersoll,\nGale (Mazeppa) Edwin, Horncastle. Some of the women hastily remember'd\nwere: Mrs. Vernon, Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. McClure, Mary Taylor, Clara\nFisher, Mrs. Richardson, Mrs. Flynn. Then the singers, English, Italian\nand other: Mrs. Wood, Mrs. Seguin, Mrs. Austin, Grisi, La Grange,\nSteffanone, Bosio, Truffi, Parodi, Vestvali, Bertucca, Jenny Lind,\nGazzaniga, Laborde. And the opera men: Bettini, Badiali, Marini, Mario,\nBrignoli, Amodio, Beneventano, and many, many others whose names I do\nnot at this moment recall.\n\nIn another paper I have described the elder Booth, and the Bowery\nTheatre of those times. Afterward there was the Chatham. The elder\nThorne, Mrs. Thorne, William and John Sefton, Kirby, Brougham, and\nsometimes Edwin Forrest himself play'd there. I remember them all, and\nmany more, and especially the fine theatre on Broadway near Pearl, in\n1855 and '6.\n\nThere were very good circus performances, or horsemanship, in New York\nand Brooklyn. Every winter in the first-named city, a regular place\nin the Bowery, nearly opposite the old theatre; fine animals and fine\nriding, which I often witness'd. (Remember seeing near here, a young,\nfierce, splendid lion, presented by an African Barbary Sultan to\nPresident Andrew Jackson. The gift comprised also a lot of jewels, a\nfine steel sword, and an Arab stallion; and the lion was made over to a\nshow-man.)\n\nIf it is worth while I might add that there was a small but\nwell-appointed amateur-theatre up Broadway, with the usual stage,\norchestra, pit, boxes, &c., and that I was myself a member for some\ntime, and acted parts in it several times--\"second parts\" as they were\ncall'd. Perhaps it too was a lesson, or help'd that way; at any rate it\nwas full of fun and enjoyment.\n\nAnd so let us turn off the gas. Out in the brilliancy of the\nfoot-lights--filling the attention of perhaps a crowded audience, and\nmaking many a breath and pulse swell and rise--O so much passion and\nimparted life!--over and over again, the season through--walking,\ngesticulating, singing, reciting his or her part--But then sooner or\nlater inevitably wending to the flies or exit door--vanishing to sight\nand ear--and never materializing on this earth's stage again!\n\n\nSOME PERSONAL AND OLD-AGE JOTTINGS\n\nAnything like unmitigated acceptance of my \"Leaves of Grass\" book, and\nheart-felt response to it, in a popular however faint degree, bubbled\nforth as a fresh spring from the ground in England in 1876. The time was\na critical and turning point in my personal and literary life. Let me\nrevert to my memorandum book, Camden, New Jersey, that year, fill'd with\naddresses, receipts, purchases, &c., of the two volumes pub'd then by\nmyself--the \"Leaves,\" and the \"Two Rivulets\"--some home customers, for\nthem, but mostly from the British Islands. I was seriously paralyzed\nfrom the Secession war, poor, in debt, was expecting death, (the doctors\nput four chances out of five against me,)--and I had the books printed\nduring the lingering interim to occupy the tediousness of glum days and\nnights. Curiously, the sale abroad proved prompt, and what one might\ncall copious: the names came in lists and the money with them, by\nforeign mail. The price was $10 a set. Both the cash and the emotional\ncheer were deep medicines; many paid double or treble price, (Tennyson\nand Ruskin did,) and many sent kind and eulogistic letters; ladies,\nclergymen, social leaders, persons of rank, and high officials. Those\nblessed gales from the British Islands probably (certainly) saved me.\nHere are some of the names, for I w'd like to preserve them: Wm. M.\nand D.G. Rossetti, Lord Houghton, Edwd. Dowden, Mrs. Anne Gilchrist,\nKeningale Cook, Edwd. Carpenter, Therese Simpson, Rob't Buchanan, Alfred\nTennyson, John Ruskin, C.G. Gates, E.T. Wilkinson, T.L. Warren, C.W.\nReynell, W.B. Scott, A.G. Dew Smith, E.W. Gosse, T.W. Rolleston, Geo.\nWallis, Rafe Leicester, Thos. Dixon, N. MacColl, Mrs. Matthews, R.\nHannah, Geo. Saintsbury, R.S. Watson, Godfrey and Vernon Lushington,\nG.H. Lewes, G.H. Boughton, Geo. Fraser, W.T. Arnold, A. Ireland, Mrs. M.\nTaylor, M.D. Conway, Benj. Eyre, E. Dannreather, Rev. T.E. Brown, C.W.\nSheppard, E.J.A. Balfour, P.B. Marston, A.C. De Burgh, J.H. McCarthy,\nJ.H. Ingram, Rev. R.P. Graves, Lady Mount-temple, F.S. Ellis, W.\nBrockie, Rev. A.B. Grosart, Lady Hardy, Hubert Herkomer, Francis\nHueffer, H.G. Dakyns, R.L. Nettleship, W.J. Stillman, Miss Blind, Madox\nBrown, H.R. Ricardo, Messrs. O'Grady and Tyrrel; and many, many more.\n\nSeverely scann'd, it was perhaps no very great or vehement success; but\nthe tide had palpably shifted at any rate, and the sluices were turn'd\ninto my own veins and pockets. That emotional, audacious, open-handed,\nfriendly-mouth'd just-opportune English action, I say, pluck'd me like a\nbrand from the burning, and gave me life again, to finish my book, since\nab't completed. I do not forget it, and shall not; and if I ever have\na biographer I charge him to put it in the narrative. I have had the\nnoblest friends and backers in America; Wm. O'Connor, Dr. R.M. Bucke,\nJohn Burroughs, Geo.W. Childs, good ones in Boston, and Carnegie\nand R.G. Ingersoll in New York; and yet perhaps the tenderest and\ngratefulest breath of my heart has gone, and ever goes, over the\nsea-gales across the big pond.\n\nAbout myself at present. I will soon enter upon my 73d year, if I\nlive--have pass'd an active life, as country school-teacher, gardener,\nprinter, carpenter, author and journalist, domicil'd in nearly all the\nUnited States and principal cities, North and South--went to the front\n(moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary) during the\nsecession war, 1861 to '65, and in the Virginia hospitals and after\nthe battles of that time, tending the Northern and Southern wounded\nalike--work'd down South and in Washington city arduously three\nyears--contracted the paralysis which I have suffer'd ever since--and\nnow live in a little cottage of my own, near the Delaware in New Jersey.\nMy chief book, unrhym'd and unmetrical (it has taken thirty years, peace\nand war, \"a borning\") has its aim, as once said, \"to utter the same old\nhuman _critter_--but now in Democratic American modern and scientific\nconditions.\" Then I have publish'd two prose works, \"Specimen Days,\" and\na late one, \"November Boughs.\" (A little volume, \"Good-Bye my Fancy,\"\nis soon to be out, wh' will finish the matter.) I do not propose here\nto enter the much-fought field of the literary criticism of any of those\nworks.\n\nBut for a few portraiture or descriptive bits. To-day in the upper story\nof a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, east\nshore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low\nceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three\nquarters of it with an ingrain carpet, is half cover'd by a deep litter\nof books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected\nmanuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be\n\"express'd,\" and two or three venerable scrap books. In the room stand\ntwo large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense\nleaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array\nof writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with\ncologne-water, others with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch\nof beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt\npapers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred\nindescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some\nquite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach,\nevidently used, (good-sized print, no type less than long primer,) some\nmaps, the Bible, (the strong cheap edition of the English crown,) Homer,\nShakspere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's \"Spanish Literature,\" John\nCarlyle's Dante, Felton's \"Greece,\" George Sand's \"Consuelo,\" avery\nchoice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American\nmonthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of\nprinter's proofs and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its\nquaint old fashion'd calmness has also a smack of something alert and\nof current work. There are several trunks and depositaries back' d up\nat the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from\nWashington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years.) Indeed\nthe whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past\nlife. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them\nupon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000\npages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is\na little \"Leaves of Grass,\" latest date, six portraits, morocco bound,\nin pocket-book form.\n\nFortunately the apartment is quite roomy. There are three windows in\nfront. At one side is the stove, with a cheerful fire of oak wood, near\nby a good supply of fresh sticks, whose faint aroma is plain. On another\nside is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets. Toward\nthe windows is a huge arm-chair, (a Christmas present from Thomas\nDonaldson's young daughter and son, Philadelphia) timber'd as by some\nstout ship's spars, yellow polish'd, ample, with rattan-woven seat and\nback, and over the latter a great wide wolf-skin of hairy black and\nsilver, spread to guard against cold and draught. A time-worn look and\nscent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it.\n\nBut probably (even at the charge of parrot talk) I can give no more\nauthentic brief sketch than \"from an old remembrance copy,\" where I have\nlately put myself on record as follows: Was born May 31, 1819, in my\nfather's farm-house, at West Hills, L.I., New York State. My parents'\nfolks mostly farmers and sailors--on my father's side, of English--on\nmy mother's (Van Velsor's), from Hollandic immigration. There was, first\nand last, a large family of children; (I was the second.) We moved to\nBrooklyn while I was still a little one in frocks--and there in B.\nI grew up out of frocks--then as child and boy went to the public\nschools--then to work in a printing office. When only sixteen or\nseventeen years old, and for three years afterward, I went to teaching\ncountry schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties, Long Island, and\n\"boarded round.\" Then, returning to New York, work'd as printer and\nwriter, (with an occasional shy at \"poetry.\")\n\n1848-'9.--About this time--after ten or twelve years of experiences and\nwork and lots of fun in New York and Brooklyn--went off on a leisurely\njourney and working expedition (my brother Jeff with me) through all the\nMiddle States, and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Lived a while\nin New Orleans, and work'd there. (Have lived quite a good deal in\nthe Southern States.) After a time, plodded back northward, up the\nMississippi, the Missouri, &c., and around to, and by way of, the\ngreat lakes, Michigan, Huron and Erie, to Niagara Falls and Lower\nCanada--finally returning through Central New York, and down the Hudson.\n1852-'54--Occupied in house-building in Brooklyn. (For a little while of\nthe first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper.)\n\n1855.--Lost my dear father this year by death.... Commenced putting\n\"Leaves of Grass\" to press, for good--after many MSS. doings and\nundoings--(I had great trouble in leaving out the stock \"poetical\"\ntouches--but succeeded at last.) The book has since had some eight\nhitches or stages of growth, with one annex, (and another to come out in\n1891, which will complete it.)\n\n1862.--In December of this year went down to the field of war in\nVirginia. My brother George reported badly wounded in the Fredericksburg\nfight. (For 1863 and '64, see \"Specimen Days.\") 1865 to '71--Had a place\nas clerk (till well on in '73) in the Attorney.\n\nGeneral's Office, Washington. (New York and Brooklyn seem more like\n_home_, as I was born near, and brought up in them, and lived, man\nand boy, for 30 years. But I lived some years in Washington, and\nhave visited, and partially lived, in most of the Western and Eastern\ncities.)\n\n1873.--This year lost, by death, my dear dear mother--and, just before,\nmy sister Martha--the two best and sweetest women I have ever seen or\nknown, or ever expect to see. Same year, February, a sudden climax and\nprostration from paralysis. Had been simmering inside for several years;\nbroke out during those times temporarily, and then went over. But now a\nserious attack, beyond cure. Dr. Drinkard, my Washington physician,\n(and a first-rate one,) said it was the result of too extreme bodily and\nemotional strain continued at Washington and \"down in front,\" in 1863,\n'4 and '5. I doubt if a heartier, stronger, healthier physique, more\nbalanced upon itself, or more unconscious, more sound, ever lived, from\n1835 to '72. My greatest call (Quaker) to go around and do what I\ncould there in those war-scenes where I had fallen, among the sick and\nwounded, was, that I seem'd to be _so strong and well_. (I consider'd\nmyself invulnerable.) But this last attack shatter'd me completely. Quit\nwork at Washington, and moved to Camden, New Jersey--where I have lived\nsince, receiving many buffets and some precious caresses--and now\nwrite these lines. Since then, (1874-'91) a long stretch of illness, or\nhalf-illness, with occasional lulls. During these latter, have revised\nand printed over all my books--bro't out \"November Boughs\"--and at\nintervals leisurely and exploringly travel'd to the Prairie States, the\nRocky Mountains, Canada, to New York, to my birthplace in Long Island,\nand to Boston. But physical disability and the war-paralysis above\nalluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so. Am\nnow (1891) domicil'd, and have been for some years, in this little old\ncottage and lot in Mickle street, Camden, with a house-keeper and man\nnurse. Bodily I am completely disabled, but still write for publication.\nI keep generally buoyant spirits, write often as there comes any lull\nin physical sufferings, get in the sun and down to the river whenever\nI can, retain fair appetite, assimilation and digestion, sensibilities\nacute as ever, the strength and volition of my right arm good, eyesight\ndimming, but brain normal, and retain my heart's and soul's unmitigated\nfaith not only in their own original literary plans, but in the\nessential bulk of American humanity east and west, north and south, city\nand country, through thick and thin, to the last. Nor must I forget,\nin conclusion, a special, prayerful, thankful God's blessing to my dear\nfirm friends and personal helpers, men and women, home and foreign, old\nand young.\n\n\nOUT IN THE OPEN AGAIN\n\n_From the Camden Post, April 16, '91_.\n\nWalt Whitman got out in the mid-April sun and warmth of yesterday,\npropelled in his wheel chair, the first time after four months of\nimprisonment in his sick room. He has had the worst winter yet, mainly\nfrom grippe and gastric troubles, and threaten'd blindness; but keeps\ngood spirits, and has a new little forthcoming book in the printer's\nhands.\n\n\nAMERICA'S BULK AVERAGE\n\nIf I were ask'd _persona_ to specify the one point of America's people\non which I mainly rely, I should say the final average or bulk quality\nof the whole.\n\nHappy indeed w'd I consider myself to give a fair reflection and\nrepresentation of even a portion of shows, questions, humanity, events,\nunfoldings, thoughts, &c. &c., my age in these States.\n\nThe great social, political, historic function of my time has been of\ncourse the attempted secession war.\n\nAnd was there not something grand, and an inside proof of perennial\ngrandeur, in that war! We talk of our age's and the States'\nmaterialism--and it is too true. But how amid the whole sordidness--the\nentire devotion of America, at any price, to pecuniary success,\nmerchandise--disregarding all but business and profit--this war for\na bare idea and abstraction--a mere, at bottom, heroic dream and\nreminiscence--burst forth in its great devouring flame and conflagration\nquickly and fiercely spreading and raging, and enveloping all, defining\nin two conflicting ideas--first the Union cause--second _the other_,\na strange deadly interrogation point, hard to define--Can we not now\nsafely confess it?--with magnificent rays, streaks of noblest heroism,\nfortitude, perseverance, and even conscientiousness, through its\npervadingly malignant darkness. What an area and rounded field, upon\nthe whole--the spirit, arrogance, grim tenacity of the South--the long\nstretches of murky gloom--the general National Will below and behind\nand comprehending all--not once really wavering, not a day, not an\nhour--What could be, or even can be, grander?\n\nAs in that war, its four years--as through the whole history and\ndevelopment of the New World--these States through all trials,\nprocesses, eruptions, deepest dilemmas, (often straining, tugging at\nsociety's heart-strings, as if some divine curiosity would find out how\nmuch this democracy could stand,) have so far finally and for more than\na century best justified themselves by the average impalpable quality\nand personality of the bulk, the People _en masse_.... I am not sure but\nmy main and chief however indefinite claim for any page of mine w'd be\nits derivation, or seeking to derive itself, f'm that average quality of\nthe American bulk, the people, and getting back to it again.\n\n\nLAST SAVED ITEMS\n\n_I'm a vast batch left to oblivion_.\n\nIn its highest aspect, and striking its grandest average, essential\nPoetry expresses and goes along with essential Religion--has been and\nis more the adjunct, and more serviceable to that true religion (for of\ncourse there is a false one and plenty of it) than all the priests and\ncreeds and churches that now exist or have ever existed--even while the\ntemporary prevalent theory and practice of poetry is merely one-side and\nornamental and dainty--a love-sigh, a bit of jewelry, a feudal conceit,\nan ingenious tale or intellectual _finesse_, adjusted to the low taste\nand calibre that will always sufficiently generally prevail--(ranges of\nstairs necessary to ascend the higher.)\n\nThe sectarian, church and doctrinal, follies, crimes, fanaticisms,\naggregate and individual, so rife all thro' history, are proofs of the\nradicalness and universality of the indestructible element of humanity's\nReligion, just as much as any, and are the other side of it. Just as\ndisease proves health, and is the other side of it.... The philosophy of\nGreece taught normality and the beauty of life. Christianity teaches how\nto endure illness and death. I have wonder'd whether a third philosophy\nfusing both, and doing full justice to both, might not be outlined.\n\nIt will not be enough to say that no Nation ever achiev'd materialistic,\npolitical and money-making successes, with general physical comfort, as\nfully as the United States of America are to-day achieving them. I know\nvery well that those are the indispensable foundations--the _sine\nqua non_ of moral and heroic (poetic) fruitions to come. For if those\npre-successes were all--if they ended at that--if nothing more\nwere yielded than so far appears--a gross materialistic prosperity\nonly--America, tried by subtlest tests, were a failure--has not advanced\nthe standard of humanity a bit further than other nations. Or, in plain\nterms, has but inherited and enjoy'd the results of ordinary claims and\npreceding ages.\n\nNature seem'd to use me a long while--myself all well, able, strong and\nhappy--to portray power, freedom, health. But after a while she seems to\nfancy, may-be I can see and understand it all better by being deprived\nof most of those.\n\nHow difficult it is to add anything more to literature--and how\nunsatisfactory for any earnest spirit to serve merely the amusement of\nthe multitude! (It even seems to me, said H. Heine, more invigorating to\naccomplish something bad than something empty.)\n\nThe Highest said: Don't let us begin so low--isn't our range too\ncoarse--too gross?... The Soul answer'd: No, not when we consider what\nit is all for--the end involved in Time and Space.\n\nEssentially my own printed records, all my volumes, are doubtless but\noff-hand utterances f'm Personality spontaneous, following implicitly\nthe inscrutable command, dominated by that Personality, vaguely even if\ndecidedly, and with little or nothing of plan, art, erudition, &c. If I\nhave chosen to hold the reins, the mastery, it has mainly been to give\nthe way, the power, the road, to the invisible steeds. (I wanted to see\nhow a Person of America, the last half of the 19th century, w'd appear,\nbut quite freely and fairly in honest type.)\n\nHaven't I given specimen clues, if no more? At any rate I have written\nenough to weary myself--and I will dispatch it to the printers, and\ncease. But how much--how many topics, of the greatest pointand cogency,\nI am leaving untouch'd!\n\n\n\n\nWALT WHITMAN'S LAST [49]\n\n\n\n_Good-Bye my Fancy_.--concluding Annex to _Leaves of Grass_.\n\n\"The Highest said: Don't let us begin so low--isn't our range too\ncoarse--too gross?...

Heine's first principle of criticising a book was, What motive is the\nauthor trying to carry out, or express or accomplish? and the second,\nHas he achiev'd it?\n\nThe theory of my _Leaves of Grass_ as a composition of verses has been\nfrom first to last, (if I am to give impromptu a hint of the spinal\nmarrow of the business, and sign it with my name,) to thoroughly possess\nthe mind, memory, cognizance of the author himself, with everything\nbeforehand--a full armory of concrete actualities, observations,\nhumanity, past poems, ballads, facts, technique, war and peace,\npolitics, North and South, East and West, nothing too large or too\nsmall, the sciences as far as possible--and above all America and the\npresent--after and out of which the subject of the poem, long or short,\nhas been invariably turned over to his Emotionality, even Personality,\nto be shaped thence; and emerges strictly therefrom, with all its merits\nand demerits on its head. Every page of my poetic or attempt at poetic\nutterance therefore smacks of the living physical identity, date,\nenvironment, individuality, probably beyond anything known, and in style\noften offensive to the conventions.\n\nThis new last cluster, _Good-By my Fancy_ follows suit, and yet with a\ndifference. The clef is here changed to its lowest, and the little book\nis a lot of tremolos about old age, death, and faith. The physical just\nlingers, but almost vanishes. The book is garrulous, irascible (like old\nLear) and has various breaks and even tricks to avoid monotony.

SIMONS.\n\nUITGEGEVEN DOOR\nDE MAATSCHAPPIJ VOOR GOEDE EN\nGOEDKOOPE LECTUUR--AMSTERDAM\n\n\n\n\nINLEIDING\n\n\nEen korte inleiding schijnt mij gewenscht. Van een reis, in 1892, door\nde Vereenigde Staten van Noord-Amerika, bracht ik als kostbaarste\nherinnering de _Leaves of Grass_ van Walt Whitman mee. Tijdens mijn reis\nging er geen dag om zonder dat ik iets van hem las, en nog lang daarna\nnam ik dagelijks het boek op om te herlezen. Diep was de indruk geweest,\ndien ik van den arbeid en het leven der Noord-Amerikanen had ontvangen,\ndiep was de indruk, dien ik van de _Leaves of Grass_ ontving. Deze\npoëmen, docht mij, geven een kort begrip van wat ik met bewondering en\neerbied, soms met verbijstering heb gezien; zij zijn een verkleind beeld\nder geweldige republiek, het leven van Amerika verpuurd door liefde en\ndenken van een universeel dichter. Toch geven zij meer dan de\n\"athletiscihe republiek\": zij openen heerlijke visioenen van wording,\nontwikkeling en voortgang in steeds groeiend recht: het Universum\naanschouwd door een Amerikaan, wien de Menschheid eens een plaats zal\naanwijzen te midden der groot-edelsten van allen tijd.\n\nAnderhalf jaar: te Chicago, Berlijn en Genua, gaf ik aan de vertaling\nvan wat thans wordt gepubliceerd. Dit is niet de geheele _Leaves of\nGrass_, wel de geheele Whitman, zooals hij zich in de _Leaves_\nopenbaart. De dichter herhaalt hier en daar wat hij gezegd heeft: er was\ngeen reden die herhalingen te vertalen; buitendien liet ik mij door mijn\nsmaak leiden. Er zijn enkele poëmen in de _Leaves of Grass_, die mij\nniet bezielen, wat natuurlijk aan mij en niet aan Whitman ligt. Zoo ook\nzijn eenig berijmd gedichtje _Captain, my captain_, dat ik onvertaald\nliet, uit eerbied voor het rijm, en wijl Whitmans karakter als dichter\ntoch het heerlijkst in ongebondenheid zich uit. Niettemin was het\ndenkbeeld mij een gruwel een salon-Whitman te geven. In mijn vertaling\nspreekt de bard zich uit met dezelfde zware en toch zoo zielvolle stem,\ndie de zijne is, ruw soms, duister soms, maar altijd verheven, altijd\nmenschelijk, altijd natuurlijk.\n\nMijn loon was mijn arbeid-zelf. Wat kon ik inderdaad van mijn vertaling\nverwachten? Behalve door Emerson, Whittier, Thoreau, in Amerika niet, in\nEuropa, behalve door Tennyson en Rosetti, weinig gewaardeerd, is Walt\nWhitman arm en ongeacht gestorven, nadat hij, om de \"onzedelijkheid\" van\nde _Leaves of Grass_, uit een betrekkinkje aan een ministerie te\nWashington was ontslagen. Wat ik niet verwachtte, een kleine twintig\njaar geleden, was het bezwaar om _Grashalmen_ gedrukt te krijgen. Indien\nik Whitman fatsoenlijk had willen maken--wat men een bloemlezing noemt,\nuit zijn _Leaves of Grass_--zou ik niet bijna vijf jaren hebben behoeven\nte wachten voor een uitgever geneigd was althans een deel van Walt\nWhitmans werk te publiceeren. Dit evenwel leek mij toen beneden den\neerbied dien ik voor den bard gevoelde: mijn vertaling zou in haar\ngeheel of niet verschijnen. Zij verschijnt nu, wel is waar niet in haar\ngeheel, maar toch in haar schoonste fragmenten.\n\nWàt, in dezen tegenspoed, kon mij teleurstellen? Niets. Walt Whitman kon\nwachten, ik had geen haast. Indien mijn levensgeluk afhankelijk ware\ngeweest van mijn literair succes, zou ik zeer beklagenswaard zijn. Mijne\nboeken vinden weinig lezers: het verlies daarvan is niet geheel aan mijn\nkant. Het verwonderde noch ontmoedigde mij, dat ik jaren had te wachten\neer men mijn _Grashalmen_ wilde publiceeren. De anderhalf jaar met\nWhitman doorleefd, schonken mij een levenswinst, die noch door eenig\nsucces kon vermeerderd, noch door eenigen tegenspoed kon verminderd\nworden.\n\nOver Walt Whitman en zijne _Leaves of Grass_ wil ik hier weinig zeggen.\nMijn vertaling geeft de maat aan van de bewondering en de liefde die ik\nvoor deze heerlijke twee-eenheid gevoel. Misschien toch kunnen een paar\nverklarende woorden hem een of twee _lovers_ meer winnen. Men moet de\n_Leaves of Grass_ niet nemen als gedichten, Walt Whitman niet als\ndichter. Om een paar dichters van onderscheiden genie te noemen: Keats,\nKloos, Heine, Verlaine: naar hun beteekenis is Walt Whitman geen\ndichter. Noch kan hij gemeten worden naar welken dichter ook: zijn\nzangen zijn als symphonieën, en men denkt soms aan Beethoven, wanneer\nmen hem leest.\n\nDe oer-dichter was de man, door veel strijd, veel denken, veel leven\nhoog en groot geworden, richter, leider, priester, zanger van zijn volk.\nHij verkondigde wat recht was, deugd, liefde en schoonheid. Wat hij\nsprak was de natuurlijke wijsheid van een God-gewijde ziel, door\ninnerlijke aanschouwing en nog meer door het vuur des levens gelouterd.\nMaat en rijm kende hij niet, van verzen had hij nooit vernomen, wat men\npoëzie noemt had geen zin voor hem, maar beter dan eenig ander wist hij\nwat harmonie was en schoonheid. Hij had de menschheid lief en kende haar\nzwakheid en lijden, haar kracht en vreugde. Hij bezat dien oppermoed,\ndie, geboren uit een onbedaarlijke zucht naar vrijheid, voorbeschikt om\nalleen en hoog te staan te midden der menschen. Het leven had enkel\nbekoring en de dood geen verschrikking voor hem. Dus had zijn volk hem\nerkend als richter van allen, leider van allen, priester en zanger\ntevens. Ziehier, in de tweede helft der negentiende eeuw, in een\nsamenleving, de Noord-Amerikaansche, die nog aan het begin harer\ngeestelijke vorming staat, de oer-dichter in Walt Whitman herboren, maar\nverworpen door zijn volk, omdat de menschen van heden niet natuurlijk\nkunnen zijn.\n\nAldus moet de lezer Whitman beschouwen, wil hij hem begrijpen; zijne\npoëmen, zijne zangen zijn geen gedichten; het zijn visioenen;\nuitspraken, wetten, poëzie, zoo gij wilt, maar poëzie als erts, zooals\nhet gevonden wordt in de Ilias, in het Nibelungenlied, in de Veda's, in\nde Psalmen, in het Hooglied.\n\nWie lezen wil om zich te amuseeren, poëzie wil genieten als een zoete\nzielestreelinig, bekoorlijk door fraaie rijmen, lichten cadans en\ngedachten zwevend tusschen banaliteit, weemoed en burgermans\nverliefdheid, dien heeft Walt Whitman zelf terecht gewezen: de _Leaves\nof Grass_ zijn niet voor hem of haar. Wien het gegeven is vrij te zijn\nvan voor-oordeel, wie de schoonheid kan zien, ook wanneer zij in\nongewonen vorm verschijnt, wie zich-zelf wil geven aan den dichter en\nhet lezen steeds wil afwisselen door lang en rustig nadenken, dien opent\nWhitman grootsche verschieten van sterke liefde in de goddelijke eenheid\nvan lichaam en ziel, dien schenkt hij moed, hoop en zelfvertrouwen.\n\nWat mijn vertaling betreft: zij zal hare gebreken hebben, maar, wie mij\nook het tegendeel zegge, ik weet dat zij goed is, als geheel. Whitmans\nvlucht door Tijd en Ruimte, niettemin, is soms zoo verheven, dat ik hem\nslechts heb kunnen volgen door lager te Wijven dan hij; op andere punten\nis de vertaling, onder het werk-zelf, en, natuurlijk zonder dat die\nbedoeling voorzat, beter geworden dan het oorspronkelijke. Ik gewoel\ntemeer vrijmoedigheid dit te zeggen, wijl ik bij mijn werk geholpen werd\ndoor een dier vrouwen, die door een waarlijk hemielsche eigenschap alles\nverbeteren wat zij aanraken. Onze vriendschap-zelve belet mij haar te\nnoemen, maar wanneer ik, zooals ik hiermeê doe, _Grashalmen_ aan haar\nopdraag, geef ik haar slechts terug wat zij mij geleend heeft, wetende,\ndat ik voor mijn leven haar schuldenaar blijf, ook waar mij slechts van\nhaar de nagedachtenis rest.\n\n_Sevilla, Oct.

Voor onze kinderen van toekomst en heden,\nVoor hen, die om ons heen zijn en voor hen die komen,\nIk, juichend, nu mij-zelf bewust, doe opluiden mijn zangen,\n  kloeker zangen, hooger zangen dan ooit op aarde gehoord.\n\nIk zal den zangen van de passie vrijgeven,\nEn ook uw zangen, wetschenders en uitgestootenen, want ik\n  zie u aan met een goed oog, gij ook leeft in mijn hart, zoo\n  goed als de anderen.\n\nIk zal het ware gedicht der schatten schrijven,\nEn voor lichaam en geest winnen al wat zij behoeven en wat\n  leven heeft voor hen en door den dood niet wordt geschaad;\nIk wil egotisme zaaien en toonen, dat het de kiem van alles\n  is, en ik wil de bard van het karakter zijn,\nEn ik zal toonen, dat man en vrouw volkomen elkaars gelijke\n  zijn,\nEn sexueele organen en daden! Versterkt U in mij, want ik\n  ben vast besloten U te erkennen en luide en moedig te\n  verkondigen, dat gij verheven zijt,\nEn ik zal toonen, dat er in het leven geen onvolmaaktheid is,\n  en dat zij ook in de toekomst niet zal zijn,\nEn ik zal bewijzen, dat wat ons in het leven overkomt, de\n  gevolgen altijd heerlijk kunnen wezen,\nEn ik zal verklaren, dat ons niets lieflijkers kan overkomen\n  dan de dood,\nEn door mijne poëmen zal de gedachte vloeien, dat het\n  eeuwige en het tijdelijke hetzelfde zijn,\nEn dat alle dingen des heelals wonderen zijn, elk hunner zoo\n  groot als een ander.\n\nIk zal niet dichten om een deel slechts eer te geven,\nIk wil dichten, zingen, denken ter glorie van het Al,\nEn ik zal niet zingen om een enkelen dag, maar om alle\n  dagen te eeren,\nEn ik zal niet een enkel gedicht, noch een enkelen regel van\n  een gedicht schrijven, zonder de ziel te eeren,\nImmers, na het leven des Heelals te hebben aanschouwd, vind\n  ik dat geheel noch deel zijn kan zonder de ziel.\n\n\n12.\n\nVroeg daar iemand de ziel te zien?\nZie uw eigen gestalte en gelaat, de menschen, de dingen, de\n  beesten, boomen, stroomende rivieren, de rotsen en de\n  woestijnen,\nAlles heeft eens het Paradijs gekend en later verloren;\nHoe kan dan waarlijk het lichaam ooit sterven en begraven\n  worden?\n\nOf waarlijk uw lichaam, of waarlijk het lichaam van welken\n  man of welke vrouw ook,\nIedere atoom van ons lichaam ontsnapt aan de hand des\n  afleggers en wijkt naar de sferen die van gelijk leven zijn,\nMet zich nemende al wat bezeten en ontvangen werd van het\n  moment der geboorte tot het oogenblik des doods.\n\nDe lettertypen door den zetter bijeengevoegd geven in hun\n  afdruk de meening en de bedoeling des schrijvers niet\n  beter weer,\nDan eens mans wezen en leven of eener vrouw door lichaam\n  en ziel worden weergegeven,\n  Onverschillig voor den dood of na den dood.\n\nZie dan, het lichaam bevat de meening en de bedoeling Gods,\n  het bevat en is de ziel;\nWie gij ook zijt, hoe heerlijk en hoe goddelijk is uw lichaam\n  en ieder deel uws lichaams!\n\n\n13.\n\nO Camerado dien ik liefheb! O gij en ik vereend ten laatste\n  en wij tweeën nu voor ons-zelf alleen!\nO, één woord dat het leven schoon en kostelijk en eindeloos\n  maakt!\nO, iets dat ons extase geeft en niet van deze aarde! O muziek\n  van passie!\nO, nu is mijn triumf volkomen en de uwe met de mijne;\nO, hand in hand--O, enkel vreugde--O, een die mij\n  begeert en liefheeft meer!\nO, het leven is ons! Spoeden wij ons!

Niets zal ik aanvaarden waaraan niet allen op\n  dezelfde voorwaarden deel kunnen hebben.\n\nDoor mij spreken verboden stemmen,\nStemmen van seksen en van begeerten, stemmen heesch nog\n  en ik verwijder die heeschheid,\nStemmen die laag worden geacht en die ik zal verluiden en\n  verklaren\n\nIk leg mij de vingers niet op de lippen,\nVoor mij zijn de ingewanden even schoon en even hoog als\n  hoofd en hart,\nDe paring is mij niet minder schoon dan mij de dood is.\n\nIk geloof in den vleeze en in de begeerten,\nZien, hooren, voelen zijn wonderen, en elk deel en elke vezel\n  van mij is een wonder.\n\n\n9.\n\nIk denk ik zou met de dieren kunnen omgaan en leven, zij\n  zijn zoo vreedzaam en zelf-voldaan,\nIk sta langen tijd stil om hen te bespieden.\nZij maken zich niet warm en schreien niet over hun leven,\nZij zijn niet slapeloos in den nacht en beweenen hunne zonden,\nZij maken mij niet wee met den praat over hunne plichten\n  tot God,\nNiet een hunner is onbevredigd, niet een geslagen met de\n  manie van eigendomsbegeerte,\nNiet een knielt voor den ander, niet voor zijns gelijke die\n  duizenden jaren vroeger leefde,\nNiet een is achtenswaardig of ongelukkig over de geheele\n  wereld.\n\nAldus toonen zij hun betrekking tot mij en ik erken die,\nIk vind eigenschappen van mij zelf in hen terug, die zij\n  duidelijk toonen te bezitten\n\nIk verwonder mij hoe zij aan die eigenschappen zijn gekomen,\nHeb ik hun weg in den oer-tijd bewandeld en heb ik ze\n  onachtzaam verloren,\nIk-zelf toen, nu en altijd voortgaande,\nVerzamelende en bewijzende altijd meer en altijd sneller,\nOneindig en alsoortig en dus de gelijken van dezen daarbij,\nNiet laag neerziende op hen, die mij mijn vroeger bestaan\n  herinneren,\nZoek ik uit allen een dien ik liefheb en met wien ik als een\n  broeder zal leven.\n\n\n10.\n\nEenzaam te middernacht in mijn tuin, mijne gedachten gaan\n  een lange wijl van mij uit,\nDaar wandel ik over de oude heuvels van Judea met den\n  schoonen, zachtmoedigen God aan mijn zijde,\nEn snel op door de ruimte, snel op door hemelen en sterrengroepen,\nSnel op tusschen de zeven satellieten door den breeden ring\n  en den diameter van tachtig duizend mijlen,\nSnel op met de staartmeteoren, vuurkloten afwerpende als zij,\nDragende het groeiende kind dat zijn eigen zwangere moeder\n  in de buik draagt,\nStormend, genietend, ontwerpend, liefhebbend, waarschuwend,\nSteunend en tevredenstellend, verschijnend en verdwijnend\nAldus betreed ik deze paden dag en nacht.\n\nIk bezoek de gaarden der sferen en zie wat zij voortbrengen,\nEn zie quintillioenen rijpe en quintillioenen onrijpe vruchten.\n\nIk vlieg de vlucht eener vloeiende, zwelgende ziel,\nMijn loop gaat dieper dan het dieplood peilt.\n\nIk help mij-zelf aan wat ik stoffelijks of onstoffelijks behoef,\nGeen wacht kan mij buitenhouden, geen wet kan mij verhinderen.\n\n\n11.\n\nIk hoorde wat daar over het Universum werd gezegd,\nHeb 't gehoord en weer gehoord vele duizenden jaren lang;\n't Is tamelijk goed, voor zoover 't gaat--maar 't is niet alles.\n\nIk kom en van mij gaat de Heerlijkheid uit en de Kracht,\nEerst van al overbied ik alle oude waarborgventers der\n  Alleen-Zaligmaking,\nIk leg mij de zelfde afmetingen als Jehova aan,\nMaak een prentje van Kronos, van Zeus zijn zoon, van\n  Hercules zijn kleinzoon,\nKoop plaatjes van Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Boeddha,\nLeg Manitoe los in mijn portefeuille, Allah op een blad papier,\n  heb een ets van den gekruisigde,\nIk reken af met Odin en met den afzichtelijk grijnzenden\n  Mexitli en met ieder afgods- en heiligenbeeld.\nIk neem allen voor wat zij waard zijn, maar niet voor een\n  cent meer,\nErken dat zij geleefd hebben en in hun tijd hun werk deden,\n(Zij droegen wormpjes aan als voor ongevederde vogels, maar\n  dezen zullen nu opstaan en uitvliegen en zingen in eigen\n  kracht.)\nIk aanvaard de ruwe Godsbegrippen, maar verbeter en verfijn\n  ze in mij-zelf en deel er gulhartig van mee aan iederen\n  man en iedere vrouw die ik ontmoet,\nOntdek evenveel van hun godheid of meer zelfs in den bouwer\n  die een huis bouwt,\nEisch hoogere rechten voor hem daar met zijne opgerolde\n  hemdsmouwen en hamer of beitel ter hand,\nWeiger niet de bijzondere openbaringen aan te hooren, maar\n  beschouw een rookwenteling of een haar op den rug mijner\n  hand even gewichtig als welke openbaring ook\nJonge kerels bij de brandspuiten en op de reddingsladders\n  zijn voor mij niet minder dan de goden in den antieken\n  krijg.\nIk luister naar den galm hunner stemmen, die het vlammengieren\n  der verdelging doorsnijdt,\nTerwijl hunne gespierde lichamen ongedeerd over de verkoolde\n  balken gaan, hunne bleeke voorhoofden ongedeerd\n  en boven het vuur uit;\nIk vergelijk die goden bij de smidsvrouw, met haar zuigeling\n  aan de borst, die genadig is voor iederen pasgeborene;\nDrie gierende seizen ter oogst in een rij van drie sterke\n  engelen met hemden om hunne lendenen opgerold;\nDe roodharige staljongen met puntige tanden, verlosser van\n  verleden en toekomstige zonden,\nDie al wat hij bezit verkoopt en een verre voetreis maakt om\n  een advocaat te betalen voor zijn broêr, die voor vervalsching\n  terechtstaat en om dien broêr bij te staan;\nWat werd ooit in de mildste rooiing op de vierkante roede om\n  mij heen gerooid, waarvan die vierkante roede niet vervuld\n  was?\nDe stier en het insect werden nimmer genoeg verheerlijkt;\nDrek en vuil zijn bewonderenswaardiger dan ooit werd gedroomd;\nHet bovennatuurlijke is voor ons van geen belang: ik zelf\n  wacht mijn tijd uit om eens een der allerhoogsten te\n  worden;\nDe dag zal weldra daar zijn, dat ik evenveel goed zal doen\n  als de beste en even wonderbaarlijk zal zijn.\nBij mijn lichaam! Ik word reeds een schepper,\nEn leg de kracht van mijn leven in den omwikkelden schoot\n  der duisternis.\n\n\n12.\n\nDit mijn lied is niet het lied van den sleur,\nHet vraagt onverwacht, het snelt op en daalt af, maar brengt\n  altijd nader;\nDat is een gedrukt en gebonden boek--maar wat is de drukker,\n  wat is de drukkersjongen?\nEen welgeslaagde fotografie--maar uw vriend of meisje\n  teeder en vast in uw armen?\nHet zwarte schip met ijzer gepantserd, zijn vreeselijke kanonnen\n  in de torens--maar de zeemanschap van kapitein en\n  machinisten?\nIn de huizen de gevulde schalen en het maal en de meubels--\n  maar de gastheer en de gastvrouw en de blik hunner oogen?\nDe hemel daar omhoog--maar hier, of naast de deur of over\n  den weg?\nDe heiligen en wijsgeeren in de geschiedenis--maar gij-zelf?\nPreeken, credo's, godgeleerdheid,--maar het onnaspeurlijk\n  menschelijk denken?\nEn wat is rede? en wat is liefde? en wat is leven?\n\n\n13.\n\nIk ben een toppunt van verleden dingen en bevat alle dingen\n  der toekomst.\n\nMijne voeten raken een trede van de treden der trap,\nEn iedere trede draagt bundels eeuwen en grooter bundels\n  eeuwen liggen tusschen twee treden,\nAl wat onder mij is ben ik opmerkzaam doorgegaan en steeds\n  klim ik en klim ik.\n\nGeslacht na geslacht buigen de geesten zich achter mij neer,\nIn de verre verte zie ik het geweldige Oer, ik weet dat ik\n  dààr zelfs was,\nOngezien wachtte ik alomtegenwoordig en sliep in den lethargischen\n  nevel,\nEn wachtte mijn tijd af, zonder geschaad te worden door de\n  stinkende koolstof.\n\nLang werd ik door krachtige armen omhelsd--lang en lang.\n\nOnberekenbaar zijn de voorbereidingen voor mij geweest,\nTrouw en liefdevol waren de armen die mij droegen,\nDoor de kringloopen werd mijn wieg voortbewogen, zij roeiden\n  en roeiden als vroolijke roeiers,\nOm mij ruimte te geven stelden de sterren zich in hare ringen\n  ter zij,\nZij zonden mij hare invloeden om zorg voor mij te dragen.\n\nVoor ik uit mijn moeder geboren werd baanden vele menschengeslachten\n  mijn weg,\nNooit is mijn embryo in zijn groei vertraagd, niets kon den\n  glans er van verduisteren.\n\nNevelen formeerden zich er voor tot werelden,\nDe lange, langzame melkweg werd vast om het te doen\n  rusten,\nReuzengewassen gaven het levenssap,\nMonsterachtige sauroïden droegen het in den muil en legden\n  het voorzichtiglijk neer.\n\nAlle krachten van het Heelal zijn eeuwig voor mij ingespannen\n  om mij te volmaken en te bekoren,\nNu sta ik hier op deze plek met mijn sterke ziel.\n\n\n14.\n\nIk open mijn dakvenster in den nacht en zie de ver-uitgestrooide\n  sterrengroepen,\nEn allen die ik zie, zooveel vermenigvuldigd als ik kan\n  becijferen, geven slechts een som die de nog verdere\n  sterrengroepen bezoomt.\n\nZij verspreiden zich verder en verder, wijden zich uit en\n  wijden zich altijd uit,\nDieper en dieper en eeuwig dieper in de eeuwigheid.\nMijn zon heeft haar zon die gehoorzaam om haar rondwentelt,\nDeze vereenigt zich met hare makkers tot een groep van nog\n  verhevener omgang,\nEn dichtere rijen volgen, die van de grootsten in haar midden\n  stippen maken.\n\nEr is geen stilstand en nimmer kan er stilstand zijn,\nIndien ik, gij en de werelden en alles beneden en op haar\n  oppervlak zouden worden herleid tot een bleek gedobber in\n  het Al, 't zou niets hinderen op den duur,\nWij zouden zeker opnieuw komen waar wij nu staan,\nEn zeker zoover komen als wij gekomen zijn en dan verder\n  gaan en verder.\n\nEnkele quadrillioenen tijdperken, enkele octillioenen kubieke\n  mijlen brengen het Verband niet in gevaar of doen er\n  ongeduld binnensluipen,\nZij zijn maar deelen, en alles is maar een deel.\n\nZie zoover gij kunt, verder nog is onbegrensde ruimte,\nReken zooveel gij kunt, daar is oneindige tijd omheen.\n\nMijn samentreffen is bepaald, is zeker,\nDe Heer zal mij wachten tot ik in volmaaktheid kom,\nDe verheven Camerado, de ware liefdegever naar wien ik\n  smacht, zal ik ontmoeten.\n\n\n15.\n\nIk weet mij behoort het beste van tijd en ruimte, en nooit\n  werd ik gemeten en nimmer zal ik gemeten worden.\n\nIk voeteer een altijddurende reis (komt, luistert allen!)\nMijn kenteekenen zijn een waterdichte mantel, sterke schoenen\n  en een boomtak tot staf,\nGeen mijner vrienden kan zijn rust in mijn stoel nemen,\nIk heb geen stoel, geen kerk, geen filosofie,\nIk leid niemand ten maaltijd, of naar de bibliotheek of naar\n  de Beurs,\nMaar ieder uwer, man of vrouw, leid ik op een bergtop,\nMijn linkerhand kromt zich rond uw middel,\nEn mijn rechterhand wijst op de landschappen der werelddeelen\n  en op den open heirweg.\n\nNoch ik, noch iemand anders kan dien weg voor U opgaan,\nGij-zelf moet dien weg opgaan.\n\nDie weg is niet ver, die weg is licht te bereiken,\nMisschien bewandelt gij dien weg reeds van het oogenblik\n  uwer geboorte af, zonder het te weten,\nMisschien is die weg overal, te water en te land.\n\nSchouder uw ransel, lieve zoon, en ook ik zal mijn ransel\n  schouderen en laten wij haast maken om voort te komen,\nWondervolle steden en vrije volken zullen wij op onze reis\n  bezoeken.\n\nIndien gij vermoeid zijt, geef mij dan beide lasten te dragen\n  en laat uw hand op mijn heup rusten,\nTer zijner tijd zult gij mij denzelfden dienst bewijzen,\nWant als wij eenmaal dien weg zijn opgegaan zullen wij niet\n  weder rusten.\n\nVoor 't hedenmorgen daagde ben ik een heuvel opgegaan en\n  keek op naar den sterrenhemel,\nEn ik zei tot mijn geest: _Wanneer wij een zullen geworden\n  zijn met gindsche werelden en één met het genot en de\n  kennis van alle dingen die zij bevatten, zullen wij dan zalig\n  zijn en voldaan?_\nEn mijn geest zeide: _Neen, wij dringen enkel tot hunne hoogste\n  hoogten door om, daar voorbij, verder te streven._\n\nOok gij stelt mij vragen en ik hoor U aan,\nIk antwoord dat ik niet kan antwoorden, gij moet U-zelf de\n  verklaring geven.\n\nZet U neer een poos lieve zoon,\nHier is brood om te eten en hier is melk om te drinken,\nMaar zoodra gij slaapt en U-zelf dus vernieuwt in een zoet\n  kleed, kus ik U met een vaarwel-kus en open de deur\n  voor uw later vertrek.\n\nLang genoeg hebt gij verachtelijke droomen gedroomd,\nNu wasch ik U den slaap uit de oogen,\nEn moet gij U gewennen aan den glans van het daglicht en\n  van elk uwer levensoogenblikken.\n\nGij hebt lang genoeg schroomvallig gewaad en de plank\n  vastgehouden, die U met het land verbond,\nNu begeer ik dat gij een kloek zwemmer zijt,\nDat gij U midden in de golvende baren werpt, dan weer\n  opkomt, mij toeknikt, schatert en lachend het water uit\n  uwe haren doet spatten.\n\n\n16.\n\nIk heb gezegd, dat de ziel niet meer is dan het lijf,\nEn ik heb gezegd, dat het lijf niet meer is dan de ziel.\nEn niets, God niet, is gewichtiger voor iemand dan zijn eigen\n  ik voor hem is,\nEn wie ook een honderd meter vèr gaat zonder sympathie,\n  loopt in een doodskleed in zijn eigen begrafenisstoet,\nEn ik en gij, zonder een cent op zak, wij mogen het beste\n  der aarde koopen,\nEn die zijne oogen op U richt, of een boon in haar schel laat\n  zien maakt het onderwijs van alle tijden beschaamd,\nEn daar is noch handel noch ambt of de jongeling die er zich\n  in begeeft kan er een held in worden,\nEn daar is geen ding zoo klein of 't is een naaf voor de\n  wielen des Heelals,\nEn ik zeg tot iederen man of vrouw; richt uw ziel onverschillig\nen rustig op tegenover een millioen Heelallen.\n\nEn ik zeg tot de Menschheid: stel geen vragen ten opzichte\n  van God,\nWant ik die vragen stel ten opzichte van alles, stel geen\n  vragen ten opzichte van God,\n(Niet een enkele woordschikking kan zeggen hoe gerust ik\n  ben ten opzichte van God en van den Dood).\n\nIk hoor en zie God in ieder ding, toch begrijp ik God in 't\n  geheel niet,\nNoch begrijp ik hoe daar een grooter wonder kan zijn dan\n  ik-zelf ben.\n\nWaarom zou ik wenschen God beter te zien dan ik Hem\n  dezen dag zie?\nIk zie iets van God elk uur van een etmaal en elk oogenblik\n  van een uur,\nIn de gezichten van mannen en vrouwen zie ik God en in mijn\n  eigen gezicht in den spiegel,\nIk vind brieven van God in de straten en elke brief is\n  geteekend met Gods naam,\nEn ik laat hen waar zij zijn, want ik weet dat waar ik ook ga,\nIk anderen zal vinden eeuwiglijk en eeuwiglijk.\n\n\n17.\n\nEn wat U betreft, Dood, en U bittere kus der sterflijkheid,\n  vergeefs tracht gij mij ongerust te maken.\n\nZonder zich op zijn weg op te houden snelt de vroedmeester\n  naar zijn werk,\nIk zie hoe de ervaren hand drukt, ontvangt, ondersteunt,\nIk zie aandachtig toe aan de drempels dier uitnemend gewillige\n  deuren,\nEn zie het uitlaten en merk op hoe verlichting wordt gegeven\n  en hoe het leven uitbreekt.\n\nEn wat U betreft, Lijk, ik denk gij zijt een voortreffelijke\n  mest, maar hinderen doet dit mij niet,\nIk ruik den zoeten geur der bloeiende witte rozen,\nIk strek mij uit naar de gebladerde lippen, ik strek mij uit\n  naar de gladde borsten der meloenen.\n\nEn wat U betreft, Leven, ik denk gij zijt de erfenis van\n  velerlei dood,\n(En zonder twijfel ben ik-zelf vroeger reeds tienduizenden\n  malen gestorven.)\nIk hoor uw gefluister o hemelsche sterren,\nO zon--o gras van graven--o eindeloos overbrengen en\n  bevorderen,\nIndien gij niets zegt, hoe kan ik dan iets zeggen?\n\nVan de troebele poel in het herfstbosch,\nVan de maan die steile schachten in de suizende schemering\n  doet glanzen,\nValt vonkels van dag en duister--valt op de zwarte stammen\n  die in de drab vergaan,\nVerlicht het klagelijk gefluister der verdorde rompen.\n\nIk stijg hooger dan de maan, hooger dan de nacht,\nIk ontdek dat de doodsbleeke schemer een weerschijn is van\n  de middagzonnestralen,\nEn goed doet aan het hechtste en middenste van alle leven,\n  groot of klein.\n\n\n18.\n\nVerleden en heden wijken naar achteren--ik heb er aan\n  gegeven, ik heb er aan ontleend,\nNu arbeid ik door en vervul den arbeid van de toekomst.\n\nGij daar die naar mij luistert! Wat hebt gij mij toe te vertrouwen?\nZie mij in het gezicht, terwijl ik de avondlucht inadem,\n(Spreek eerlijk, niemand anders luistert, en ik wil een minuut\n  langer toeven.)\n\nSpreek ik mij-zelf tegen?\nZeer goed, dan spreek ik mij-zelf tegen.\nIk ben breed, ik omvat veelheden.\n\nIk richt mij tot hen die mij na zijn, ik wacht op den dorpel.\n\nWie heeft zijn dagtaak verricht? Wie zal 't eerste klaar zijn\n  met zijn avondmaal?\nWie wenscht met mij te gaan?\n\nWilt gij spreken voor ik zal vertrokken zijn? Wilt gij zeggen\n  dat 't reeds te laat is?\n\n\n19.\n\nDe gevlekte valk strijkt neer en beschuldigt mij, hij beklaagt\n  zich over mijn gesnap en getalm.\n\nOok ik ben niet in 't minste getemd, ook ik ben onverklaarbaar,\nIk doe mijn wilde kreten galmen over de daken der wereld.\n\nDe laatste wolkenvlucht van den dag houdt zich voor mij op,\nZij is een beeld van mij zoo gelijkend als eenig beeld kan zijn,\nHet vleit mij dat ik damp ben en stof.\n\nIk ga heen als lucht, ik schud mijn witte lokken bij het wegsnellen\n  van de zon,\nMijn vleesch wordt damp en drijft weg in sierlijk-gewaaide\n  vlokken.\n\nIk vermaak mij-zelf aan het slijk om er het gras uit te laten\n  groeien dat ik liefheb,\nIndien gij mij opnieuw mocht wenschen te zien, zie dan naar\n  mij uit onder uwe voeten.\n\nGij zult nauwelijks kunnen weten wie ik ben of wat ik bedoel,\nMaar niettemin zal ik U welzijn schenken,\nEn uw bloed zuiveren en krachtig maken.\nEn indien gij mij aanvankelijk niet mocht kunnen vinden,\n  verlies den moed niet,\nOnderzoek dan, na de eene, de andere plaats,\nErgens toef ik en ergens wacht ik op U.\n\n\n\n\nUIT: ADAMSKINDEREN\n\n\nEEN UUR VAN WOEST GENOT\n\nEen uur van woest genot, O geweldig! O laat mij bandeloos\n  wezen!\n(Hoe komt 't toch dat ik mij in stormen zoo vrij gevoel?\nWat beteekent toch mijn gejuich onder het lichten des\n  bliksems en het woeden der winden?)\nO laat mij meer van de mystieke deliria drinken dan eenig\n  ander man!\nO wilde en teedere pijnen! (Ik vermaak ze U mijn kinderen,\nIk deel ze gaarne aan U mede o bruidegom en bruid.)\nO laat me mij aan U overgeven wie gij ook zijt en gij geef U\n  over aan mij ten trots van de wereld!\nO laat ik teruggaan naar het Paradijs! O schaamte en Vrouw!\nO laat ik U tegen mij aandrukken om op uwe lippen voor 't\n  eerst de kussen te planten van een zelfbewusten man.\n\nO, het raadsel, de drievoudig-gelegde knoop, de diepe, duistere\n  afgrond, alles ontbonden en verlicht!\nO ik wil heensnellen waar ik eindelijk ruimte en lucht genoeg\n  vind!\nIk wil vrijgemaakt zijn van vroegere banden en vooroordeelen,\n  ik van de mijnen zoo goed als gij van de uwen!\nIk begeer een nieuw en ongekend vrijmoedig omgaan met het\n  beste van natuur!\nIk wil de beklemming van onzen mond losgemaakt hebben!\nHeden of morgen het gevoel bezitten: ik ben genoegzaam\n  zooals ik ben.\n\nO geef mij iets nog onbewezens! iets in een verrukking des\n  geestes!\nLaat mij geheel ontsnappen aan de ankers en de grepen van\n  anderen!\nVrij te drijven! vrij te leven! zorgeloos gevaarvol door te\n  slaan!\n\nVerdelging aan te zien met hoon en haar te lokken!\nOp te stijgen tegen de hemelen der liefde waarvan ik droom,\n  er tegen op te tuimelen!\nEn steeds hooger te klimmen met mijn liefdedronken ziel!\nVerloren te gaan indien dat zijn moet!\nHet geheele verdere leven te voeden met een uur van volkomen\n  zaligheid en vrijheid!\nMet een kort uur van woest genot.\n\n\nOER-MOMENTEN\n\nOer-momenten--wanneer gij over mij heen gaat--o reeds\n  komt gij weer,\nGeeft mij nu enkel het genot van wellust,\nGeeft mij den drank mijner hartstochten, geeft mij welig, wild\n  leven,\nHeden ben ik de metgezel van de lievelingen der natuur,\n  hedennacht tevens,\nIk behoor tot hen die gelooven in den vrijen wellust, ik neem\n  deel aan de nachtelijke orgieën van jonge mannen,\nIk dans met wie dansen en drink met wie drinken,\nDe echo's weergalmen ons ontuchtig gezang, ik neem een\n  diepgevallene tot liefsten vriend,\nHij moet een wetschender zijn, ruw, ongeletterd, hij moet\n  iemand zijn door anderen veroordeeld om bedreven daden,\nIk wil niet langer veinzen, waarom zou ik vèr blijven van hen\n  die mijn ware makkers zijn?\nO gij geschuwden, ik ten minste houd mij niet verre van U,\nIk begeef mij oogenblikkelijk in uw midden, ik zal uw dichter\n  zijn.\nVoor U zal ik meer zijn dan voor een der anderen.\n\n\n\n\nUIT: CALAMUS\n\n\nOP ONBETREDEN PADEN\n\nOp onbetreden paden,\nIn het gewas der poelzoomen,\nOntsnapt aan het leven dat zich bloot geeft,\nAan alle standaardmaten, die tot nu algemeen golden, aan de\n  genoegens, voordeelen, gelijkvormigheid,\nWaarmee ik te lang mijn ziel heb trachten te voeden,\nDuidelijk nu voor mij dat er een eerlijke maat is nog niet\n  algemeen aanvaard, duidelijk mij nu dat mijn ziel,\nDat de ziel van den man voor wien ik spreek welbehagen\n  vindt in zijne gezellen,\nHier in eenzaamheid, weg van het gedruisch der wereld,\nLeg ik den kerfstok aan en hoor ik mij toespreken door welgeurende\n  lippen,\nNiet langer beschaamd (want op deze afgelegen plek kan ik\n  antwoorden wat ik elders niet zou hebben durven zeggen.)\nKrachtig in mij het leven dat zich niet vertoont en toch al het\n  andere omvat,\nVast besloten heden geen andere zangen te zingen dan die\n  van mannelijke gehechtheid,\nEn neem mij voor ze door geheel mijn aardsche leven te doen\n  hooren,\nVoortaan zal ik het voorbeeld geven van athletische liefde,\nOp den namiddag van deze lieflijke Negende Maand van mijn\n  een en veertigste jaar,\nBegin ik mijn arbeid voor allen die jonge mannen zijn of\n  geweest zijn,\nIk zal het geheim vertellen van mijne nachten en dagen,...\nIk zal de noodzaak van makkers loven.\n\n\nWIE GIJ OOK ZIJT DIE MIJ NU VASTHOUDT\n\nWie gij ook zijt die mij nu vasthoudt,\nIndien gij mist wat gij boven alles behoeft is al wat gij doet\n  nutteloos,\nErnstig waarschuw ik U voor gij dieper in mij doordringt,\nIk ben niet zooals gij mij dacht maar heel anders.\n\nWie is hij die mijn volgeling wilde worden?\nWie wilde mij toonen naar mijn liefde te dingen?\n\nDe weg is gevaarlijk, het einde onzeker, misschien ondergang,\nGij zult al 't andere moeten opgeven, ik alleen zal eenig en\n  alleen den standaard moeten zijn waaraan gij U meet,\nOok dan zal uw discipelschap lang duren en uwe krachten\n  uitputten,\nAl wat er in uw leven aan leer is en al wat uw leven gelijk\n  maakt aan de levens om U heen zult gij moeten opgeven,\nDaarom laat nu van mij af voor dat uw leven nog erger door\n  mij wordt verontrust, laat uw hand vallen van mijne\n  schouders,\nLaat mij mijn weg gaan en ga gij den uwe.\n\nZoo niet, kom ga dan stil met mij in de woudeenzaamheid,\n  waar ik U zal beproeven,\nOf achter een rots in de open lucht,\n(Want in geen bedekte ruimte van eenig huis verschijn ik U,\n  noch zult gij mij in gezelschappen zien,\nEn in bibliotheken ben ik als een stomme, als een zot, of een\n  ongeborene of een gestorvene),\nOf mogelijk met U op een hoogen heuvel, waar wij eerst\n  zullen uitturen dat niemand voor mijlen in 't rond ons onbemerkt\n  kan naderen,\nOf te zeilen met U, of met U van het zeestrand af op een stil\n  eiland,\nDaar veroorloof ik U uwe lippen op de mijne te drukken,\nMet de langbezielde kus van den makker of met de kus van\n  den jongen echtgenoot,\nWant ik ben de jonge echtgenoot en ik ben de makker.\nOf zoo gij wilt, en mij vertrouwt onder uw kleed,\nWaar ik het kloppen van uw hart mag voelen of rusten mag\n  op uw heup,\nNeem mij dan met U als gij landen en zeeën oversteekt;\nWant U aldus enkel te beroeren is mij goed, is mij lief,\nEn dus U beroerende wenschte ik zachtekens in te slapen en\n  gedragen te worden eeuwiglijk.\n\nMaar indien gij U drenkt met het levenssap dezer halmen,\n  zal er gevaar voor U zijn,\nWant noch deze halmen noch mij zult gij verstaan,\nDe geest dezer halmen zal U bij het begin ontsnappen en\n  steeds meer en meer ontsnappen, ik zal U zekerlijk ontgaan,\nZelfs terwijl gij zult denken, dat gij mij twijfelloos gevat\n  haddet, zie dan toe!\nReeds dadelijk merkt gij dat ik U ontgaan ben.\n\nWant 't is niet ter wille van wat ik er in heb nedergelegd, dat\n  ik dit boek heb geschreven,\nEvenmin zult gij het bezitten terwijl gij mij leest,\nEvenmin kennen zij mij 't best die mij bewonderen en mij\n  hoogdravend prijzen,\nEvenmin zullen zij die dingen naar mijn liefde (tenzij op zijn\n  best een zeer gering getal) die liefde winnen,\nEvenmin zullen mijne gedichten enkel goed doen, zij zullen\n  even veel kwaad doen als goed en meer nog misschien,\nWant alles is te vergeefs zonder dat waarop ik zinspeel en\n  waarnaar gij menigmaal kunt raden zonder het te vatten;\nDaarom verlaat mij nu het nog tijd is en ga uw weg.\n\n\nNIET ENKEL IN WAT IK MIJ VAN DE BORST WERP\n\nNiet enkel in wat ik mij van de borst werp,\nNiet in mijn zuchten, in mijn wanhoop 's nachts, als ik in\n  strijd ben met mijzelf,\nNiet in die lange, kwalijk onderdrukte bange zuchten,\nNiet in de vele eeden en beloften die ik brak,\nNiet in het krachtige en ontembare willen van mijn ziel,\nNiet in de ijle levenskracht der lucht,\nNiet in dit kloppen em bonzen van mijne slapen en polsen,\nNiet in dat wonderbare samentrekken en uitzetten in mijn\nbinnenste, dat eenmaal zal ophouden,\nNiet in de vele wellustige wenschen die ik enkel aan de wolken\n  heb toevertrouwd,\nNiet in de kreten, het gelach, de verwenschingen door mij\n  uitgestooten als ik diep in de wildernissen alleen was,\nNiet in het schor gehijg door vastgeklemde tanden,\nNiet in klinkende en weêrklinkende woorden, kakelwoorden,\n  echo's daarvan, doode woorden,\nNiet in het gemurmer mijner droomen terwijl ik slaap,\nNoch in dat andere gemurmer dier ongelooflijke droomen van\n  elken dag,\nNoch in de leden en zinnen van mijn lijf, die U voortdurend\n  aannemen en verstooten--niet dààrin,\nNiet in een hunner noch in allen, O aantrekkingskracht! O\n  mijns levens polsslag!\nWensch ik dat gij meer wordt gevonden of meer U-zelf bewijst\n  dan in deze zangen.\n\n\nDE VREESELIJKE TWIJFEL VAN DEN SCHIJN\n\nDe vreeselijke twijfel van den schijn,\nDe onzekerheid ten slotte dat wij misschien misleid worden,\nDat misschien vertrouwen en hoop slechts hersenschimmen zijn,\nDat misschien het identieke leven aan gene zijde des grafs\n  slechts een mooie fabel is.\nMisschien de dingen die ik waarneem, dieren, planten, menschen,\n  heuvelen, weerspiegelende en vloeiende wateren,\nDe luchten van dag en nacht, kleuren, het vaste, en de vormen\n  slechts verschijningen (zooals ook zonder twijfel het geval\n  is) en wat zij werkelijk zijn nog onbekend,\n(Hoe vaak treden zij uit zich-zelven naar voren als wilden zij\n  mij verlegen maken en mij bespotten!\nHoe vaak denk ik, dat ik noch iemand het geringste van hen\n  weet,)\nDat misschien hun schijn dien ik van mijn tegenwoordig\n  standpunt zie (en die schijn tenminste is zeker) indien ik op\n  een geheel ander standpunt naar hen uitzie zal blijken\n  anders te wezen (zooals die schijn dan ook even zeker\n  anders zal zijn) en niets gemeen te hebben met den schijn\n  van nu of in 't geheel niets is;\nDeze en dergelijke vragen worden wonderbaar beantwoord\n  door hen die mij liefhebben, mijn lieve vrienden,\nWanneer hij die mij liefheeft met mij reist of langen tijd\n  naast mij zit, terwijl hij mijn hand in de zijne houdt,\nAls de ijle lucht, de ontastbaarheid, de zin dien woorden en\n  redenen niet bevatten ons omringt en in ons doordringt,\nDan ben ik zalig van ongezegde en niet te zeggen wijsheid,\n  ik ben stil en vraag niets meer,\nWel kan ik de vraag van zijn en schijnen of die van het\n  identieke leven aan gene zijde des grafs niet beantwoorden,\nMaar ik ga voort of zit neder en stoor er mij niet verder aan,\n  ik ben tevreden,\nHij die mijn hand in de zijne houdt heeft mij volkomen\n  bevredigd.\n\n\nGIJ DIE GETUIGEN ZULT IN DE VOLGENDE EEUWEN\n\nGij die getuigen zult in de volgende eeuwen,\nKomt, ik wil U vertrouwen in het innigste onder dit onlijdelijk\n  uiterlijk, ik zal U zeggen hoe gij mij heeten moet,\nNoem mijn naam en hang mijn beeltenis op als van den man\n  die de teederste minnaar was,\nHet portret van den vriend, den liefdezoeker, die door zijn\n  vriend, zijn liefdezoeker zeer teeder werd bemind,\nDie zich niet verhief op zijne zangen maar wel op de onmetelijke\n  zee van liefde in zijn ziel, die hij mildelijk uitstortte,\nDie vaak in groote verlatenheid waarde en dan dacht aan\n  zijne lieve vrienden, aan die hem lief hadden,\nDie vèr verwijderd van hem dien hij liefhad peinsde in slapelooze\n  nachten, vol onvoldaanheid,\nDie maar al te goed de pijnlijke, pijnlijke vrees kende, dat hij\n  hem dien hij liefhad toch heimelijk onverschillig was,\nWiens gelukkigste dagen die waren als, in de verte van alles,\n  in velden, wouden en op heuvels, hij en een ander wandelden\n  hand in hand, zij tweeën alleen, van andere menschen\n  verwijderd,\nDie vaak in de straten drentelde zijn arm gebogen over den\n  schouder van zijn vriend, terwijl de arm van zijn vriend\n  op zijn schouder rustte.\n\n\nTOEN IK DEN AVONDSTOND HOORDE\n\n  Toen ik in den avondstond hoorde dat mijn naam in het\n  Capitool met toejuichingen was ontvangen, was voor mij de\n  nacht die volgde toch geen nacht van geluk,\nEn later in welslagen of wanneer mijn voornemens verwerkelijkt\n  waren, was ik toch niet gelukkig,\nMaar de dag dat ik mij met zonsopgang van mijn bed verhief\n  volkomen gezond, verfrischt, zingende, ademende den\n  rijpen herfstadem,\nToen ik ten Westen de volle maan zag verbleeken en in het\n  morgenlicht verdwijnen,\nToen ik alleen over het strand wandelde en, ontkleed,\n  baadde, dartelend met de koele wateren en de zon zag\n  opstijgen,\nEn toen ik dacht dat mijn lieve vriend, die mij teeder liefheeft,\n  op weg was naar mij toe, o toen was ik gelukkig,\nO toen smaakte elke bete mij zoeter en dien geheelen dag\n  voedde mijn brood mij beter en die heerlijke dag ging heerlijk\n  voorbij,\nEn de volgende kwam met gelijke vreugd en met den volgende,\n  's avonds, kwam mijn vriend,\nEn dien nacht, toen alles rondom stil was, hoorde ik de\n  wateren langzaam rollen, rollen op het strand,\nIk hoorde het gierend ruischen van water en zand die fluisterend\n  op mij toekwamen, om mij geluk te wenschen,\nWant hij dien ik boven alles liefheb lag slapend aan mijn\n  zijde onder hetzelfde dek in den koelen nacht,\nIn de nachtstilte, in den herfstmaneschijn was zijn gezicht\n  naar mij toegekeerd,\nEn zijn arm lag zachtkens over mijn borst--en die nacht\n  was een nacht van geluk.\n\n\nVIND IK IN U OPNIEUW EEN HART DAT ZICH DOOR MIJ VOELT AANGETROKKEN?\n\nVind ik in U opnieuw een hart dat zich door mij voelt aangetrokken?\nLaat ik U dan dadelijk waarschuwen, ik ben zeker heel\n  anders dan gij denkt;\nDenkt gij dat gij in mij uw ideaal zult vinden?\nDenkt gij dat 't zoo gemakkelijk is mijn liefde te winnen?\nDenkt gij dat mijn vriendschap U onvermengde voldoening\n  zou schenken?\nDenkt gij dat ik geloofwaardig ben en getrouw?\nZiet gij dan niet dieper dan den schijn, niet beneden mijne\n  zachte en verdraagzame woorden?\nGelooft gij dat ge met uwe voeten op de werkelijkheid voortschrijdt\n  naar een werkelijken held?\nIs niet wel eens de gedachte in U op gekomen, o Droomer,\n  dat dit alles misschien niets is dan maya, illusie.\n\n\nIK ZAG IN LOUISIANA EEN LEVENSEIK\n\nIk zag in Louisiana een levenseik,\nHij stond ganschelijk alleen en het mos hing neer van zijne\n  takken,\nHij leefde daar zonder een enkelen kameraad, toch uitte hij\n  zich in blijde donkergroene bladen,\nEn zijn uitzien ruw, vrij en krachtig deed mij denken aan\n  mij-zelf,\nToch verwonderde ik mij hoe hij zich in blijde bladen kon\n  uiten, daar in de eenzaamheid zonder een makker aan zijn\n  zijde, ik wist wel dat ik dit niet zou kunnen,\nEn ik brak een twijg af met wat bladeren er aan en wond er\n  wat mos om,\nEn nam haar mee en hing haar in mijn kamer op, zoodat ik er\n  altijd het oog op heb,\n't Was niet noodig om mij steeds aan mijne lieve vrienden\n  te doen denken,\n(Want in den laatsten tijd, geloof ik, denk ik aan weinig\n  anders dan aan hen,)\nToch blijft die twijg mij een wonderbaar zinnebeeld en doet\n  me aan mannelijke liefde denken;\nHoe dan ook, die levenseik moge daar in Louisiana vroolijk\n  gedijen, alleenig in een groot vlak land,\nHij moge zich kunnen uiten in blijde bladeren, terwijl hem\n  heel zijn leven lang geen vriend, geen die zijn liefde\n  zoekt nabij is,\nIk weet maar al te goed dat ik 't niet zou kunnen.\n\n\nAAN EEN VREEMDE\n\nVoorbijgaande vreemdeling! gij weet niet hoe innig verlangend\n  ik U aanzie,\nGij moet zijn hem dien ik zoek, of haar die ik zoek ('t komt\n  in mij als een droom)\nErgens heb ik zeker een vreugdevol leven met U geleefd,\nTerwijl wij elkaar voorbijgaan fluïdisch, liefdedorstend, rein\n  en volwassen, herinner ik mij alles weer duidelijk,\nGij groeidet met mij op, waart een knaap met mij of een\n  meisje met mij,\nIk at met U en sliep met U, uw lichaam is niet enkel het\n  uwe gebleven noch heeft het mijne enkel het mijne laten\n  blijven,\nGij geeft mij de vreugde van uwe oogen, gezicht, lijf, als wij\n  elkaar voorbijgaan, gij neemt in keer van mijn baard, borst,\n  handen,\nHet is mij niet vergund tot U te spreken, het is mij enkel\n  vergund aan U te denken als ik alleen ben of waak in den\n  eenzamen nacht,\nIk moet op U wachten, ik twijfel er niet aan, dat 't mij vergund\n  zal zijn U eens opnieuw te ontmoeten,\nIk moet oppassen dat ik U niet verlieze.\n\n\nIK HOOR DAAR WERD TEGEN MIJ GETUIGD\n\nIk hoor daar werd tegen mij getuigd, dat ik instellingen door\n  de eeuwen gewijd zocht te vernietigen,\nMaar waarlijk ik ben noch voor noch tegen die door de\n  eeuwen gewijde instellingen,\n(Wat toch heb ik met ze gemeen of met de vernietiging\n  er van?)\nIk wil slechts vestigen in de Mannahatta en in elke stad\n  dezer Staten, 't zij diep in het land of aan de zee,\nEn in de velden en wouden en boven elke kiel klein of groot\n  die op de wateren dobbert,\nZonder gebouwen of wetten of besturen of eenige belijdenis,\nDe instelling van trouwe liefde tusschen kameraden.\n\n\nALS IK EENS NAGA WAT ROEM IS\n\nAls ik eens naga wat roem is, roem van heldendaden, roem\n  van overwinningen door groote veldheeren bevochten, dan\n  benijd ik die veldheeren niet,\nEn ik benijd evenmin den President in zijn presidentschap,\n  noch den rijkaard in zijn paleis,\nMaar wanneer ik hoor spreken over de broederschap van hen\n  die elkaar liefhebben, hoe zij leefden,\nHoe zij zijde aan zijde gingen door het leven, door gevaren,\n  den blaam trotseerende, altijd vol liefde voor elkaar, heel\n  den langen weg,\nVan jeugd tot manzijn en van manzijn tot grijsheid, hoe fier\n  zij waren in hun liefde, hoezeer elkaar genegen en getrouw,\nDan word' ik stil--ik ga haastig voort vervuld van den\n  bittersten nijd.\n\n\nSOMS, IN MIJN LIEFDE\n\nSoms, in mijn liefde, word ik vervuld van wanhoop, uit vrees\n  liefde uit te storten over een die mijn liefde niet beantwoordt,\nMaar nu denk ik, dat elke liefde beantwoord wordt, en dat\n  op een of andere wijs het loon zeker is,\n(Eens had ik vurig lief en werd mijn liefde niet beantwoord,\nNu, door die liefde heb ik deze zangen geschreven.)\n\n\n\n\nUIT: HET LIED VAN DEN OPEN HEIRWEG\n\n\n1.\n\nTe voet en blijmoedig neem ik den open heirweg,\nGezond, vrij, heel de wereld voor mij uit,\nDe onafzienbare bruine weg voor mij uit, die mij brengt\n  overal waar ik wensch te gaan.\n\nVoortaan zal ik nimmer naar geluk vragen, ik heb geluk in\n  mijzelf,\nVoortaan zal ik niet meer klagen, niets meer verdagen,\n  voortaan zal ik mij niets voelen ontbreken,\n't Is gedaan met in huiszitten en klagen, met boekenwijsheid,\n  met het nutteloos oordeel over anderen,\nSterk en tevreden ga ik den open heirweg op.\n\nDe aarde is mij voldoende,\nIk begeer mij de sterren niet nader,\nIk weet, wáár zij zijn is 't goed dat zij zijn,\nIk weet, dat zij genoegzaam zijn hun wier leven van hun\n  leven is.\n\nMaar ook hier draag ik mijne oude lieve lasten met mij,\nIk draag ze mee, mannen en vrouwen, ik draag ze mee overal\n  waar ik ga,\nIk zweer U: 't is onmogelijk ze van mij af te schudden,\nZij leven in mijn leven, en ik wil hun leven vervullen van\n  het mijne.\n\n\n2.\n\nGij heirweg, dien ik nu betreed en waarover ik mijn oog\n  laat ronddwalen, ik geloof dat hier meer is dan het zichtbare,\nIk geloof dat hier ook veel onzichtbaars is.\nGij leert de moeilijke les van Al-ontvankelijkheid, gij kent\n  voorkeur noch uitzondering;\nDe zwarte met zijn wollig hoofdhaar, de uitgestootene, de\n  melaatsche, de ongeletterde worden door U niet geweigerd;\nDe geboorte, het haastig halen van den doctor, de strompelende\n  bedelaar, de waggelende dronkaard, de vroolijke\n  troep werklieden,\nDe uitgelaten jeugd, de karos van den rijkaard, de pronker,\n  het vluchtende paar,\nDe vroeg ter markt gaande man, de lijkwagen, de verhuiskar\n  naar stad, de wagen die uit de stad terugkomt,\nZij gaan voort, aldus ga ook ik voort, geweerd wordt er\n  geen,\nAllen deelen in dezelfde ontvangst en mij zijn allen lief.\n\n\n3.\n\nLinks en rechts wijdt de aarde zich uit,\nEen levend beeld van leven, alles in zijn beste licht,\nNatuurmuziek gehoord waar men haar wenscht te hooren en\n  onhoorbaar als de ziel aanschouwen wil,\nDe blijde stem van den open heirweg en de blijmoedige,\n  frissche ziel van dien weg.\n\nO, heirweg dien ik nu heb ingeslagen, zegt gij mij: _verlaat\n  mij niet?_\nZegt gij mij: _Waag U niet--gij zijt verloren indien gij mij\n  verlaat?_\nZegt gij mij: _Reeds ben ik welgebaand en drukbeloopen, geen\n  die mij niet roemt, houd U aan mij?_\nO heirweg, ik antwoord U: niet bevreesd ben ik U te verlaten,\n  maar ik heb U lief,\nGij, beter dan ik 't doen kan, verklaart wat in mij is,\nGij zult mij meer zijn dan mijn gedicht.\n\nIk denk: alle heldendaden en alle vrije gedachten hebben\n  hun bezieling gevonden in de open lucht,\nIk denk: hier toevende zou ik wonderen kunnen doen,\nIk denk: wat ik ook op den heirweg ontmoete zal mij welkom\n  zijn en ieder die mij ziet zal mij liefhebben,\nIk denk: ieder dien ik zie moet gelukkig zijn.\n\n\n4.\n\nVan dezen stond af verklaar ik mij los van limieten en\n  gedachte grenzen,\nIk ga waar 't mij lijkt, geheel en volkomen mijn eigen\n  meester,\nLuister naar anderen, overweeg wat zij zeggen,\nDenk na, onderzoek, neem in mij op, bepeins,\nMaar ik maak mij vriendelijk doch met onwrikbaren wil los\n  uit den greep die mij zou willen vasthouden.\n\nIk adem de ruimte met lange teugen in,\nIk bezit Oost en West en ik bezit Noord en Zuid.\n\nIk ben grooter, beter dan ik dacht,\nIk wist niet, dat ik zoo rijk aan goedheid was.\n\nAlles lijkt mij schoon,\nIk kan tot mannen en vrouwen zeggen en herhalen: gij hebt\n  mij zooveel goed gedaan, ik woû U hetzelfde doen,\nWat ik op mijn weg zal vinden zal gelijkelijk voor U en voor\n  mij zijn,\nOp mijn weg zal ik aan mannen en vrouwen geven van\n  mij-zelf,\nIk zal nieuwe vreugde en onstuimigheid in hen werpen,\nWie mij verloochene, het zal mij niet bedroeven,\nWie mij aanvaarde, hij of zij zal gezegend zijn en mij\n  zegenen.\n\n\n5.\n\nIndien thans een duizendtal volmaakte mannen verscheen\n  zou mij dat niet verbazen,\nIndien thans een duizendtal schoone vrouwengestalten verscheen\n  zou dat mij niet verwonderen.\n\nThans ken ik het geheim om voortreffelijke menschen te\n  gewinnen:\nHet is te leven in de open lucht en te eten en te slapen\n  met de aarde.\n\nHier heeft een groote persoonlijke daad ruimte,\n(Zulk een daad legt beslag op de harten van heel het menschelijk\n  geslacht,\nDe uitvloeiing van haar kracht en wil breekt de wet en\n  bespot alle gezag en redenen die zich tegen haar mochten\n  willen kanten).\n\nHier is de toetssteen der wijsheid,\nWijsheid wordt niet in de scholen getoetst,\nWijsheid kan niet worden overgedragen van den een die\n  haar bezit op den ander die haar niet bezit,\nWijsheid is ziel, wijsheid laat zich niet toetsen, maar toetst\n  zelf,\nZij doordringt zich van alle tijden, dingen, eigenschappen en\n  is voldaan,\nZij is de zekerheid van wat waar en onvergankelijk is in\n  't leven en van wat volkomen is in 't leven,\nEr is iets in de veelheid der zichtbare dingen dat haar\n  oproept uit de ziel.\n\nNu onderzoek ik opnieuw de religiën en de wijsbegeerten,\nZij kunnen voortreffelijk zijn in collegiezalen en toch niets\n  bewijzen onder de uitgestrekte wolken en langs het landschap\n  en de vloeiende stroomen.\n\nHier is werkelijkheid,\nHier is een mensch--hier openbaart hij wat er in hem is,\nHet verleden, de toekomst, majesteit, liefde--indien zij\n  niet van U zijn vervuld, zijt gij niet van hen vervuld.\n\n\n6.\n\nHier is de uitvloeiing der Ziel,\nWat uit de ziel vloeit komt uit het binnenste door bloembekranste\n  poorten en stelt vragen steeds.\nWaarom toch dat smachten? Waarom toch dat gepeins in\n  stikdonkeren nacht?\nWaarom toch zijn er mannen en vrouwen, die als zij dicht bij\n  mij zijn zonnelicht en zonnewarmte in mijn bloed doen\n  vloeien, waardoor het zich uitzet?\nWaarom toch, wanneer zij mij verlaten, hangen mijne vreugdevanen\n  slap en plat neer?\nWaarom toch zijn er boomen onder wier gebladert ik nooit\n  wandel of verheven en melodieuze gedachten dalen in mij\n  neer!\n(Ik denk, dat zij daar winter en zomer aan die boomen\n  bloeien en als rijpe vruchten afvallen als ik voorbijkom;)\nWat ruil ik toch zoo plotseling met vreemden?\nWat met dien koetsier als ik op den bok aan zijn zijde zit?\nWat met dien visscher die aan de kust zijn zegen uitwerpt,\n  terwijl ik in 't voorbijgaan een oogenblik blijf kijken?\nWat geeft mij een zoo vrij beroep op de welwillendheid van\n  die vrouw of dien man? Wat geeft hun een zoo vrij beroep\n  op de mijne?\n\n\n7.\n\nWat uit de ziel vloeit is geluk, hier is geluk,\nIk denk het vervult de open lucht en is van allen tijde,\nNu vloeit het op ons aan en zijn wij er welzalig van.\n\nHier stijgt het fluïdum op, hier wast de zielegehechtheid,\nHet fluïdum en de zielegehechtheid is de frischheid en de\n  bekoring van man en vrouw,\n(Het ochtendstondgras spruit niet frisscher en bekoorlijker\n  iederen dag uit eigen wortels voort, dan dezen voortspruiten,\n  frisch en bekoorlijk altijd, uit zich-zelf.)\nUit naar het fluïdum en de zielegehechtheid vloeit van jong\n  en oud het liefdezweet,\nEn als een regen daalt de verrukking die alle schoonheid en\n  rijkdom te boven gaat er uit neer,\nUit naar het fluïdum en de zielegehechtheid zwelt het\n  smachten en sidderen van de pijn der gemeenschap,\n\n\n8.\n\nAllons! wie gij ook zijt, kom en reis mede!\nMet mij reizende zult gij vinden wat nimmer U vermoeit.\nDe aarde vermoeit nimmer,\nDe aarde is eerst ruw, zwijgzaam, onbegrijpelijk, de natuur is\n  eerst ruw en onbegrijpelijk,\nZij niet moedeloos, geef niet op, daar zijn godsdingen diep\n  verborgen,\nIk zweer U daar zijn godsdingen heerlijker dan woorden kunnen\n  zeggen.\n\nAllons! Wij moeten hier niet toeven,\nHoe verlokkelijk deze overvloeden, hoe gemakkelijk deze\n  woningen zijn, wij kunnen hier niet blijven,\nHoe veilig deze haven zij en hoe kalm deze wateren zijn, wij\n  mogen hier niet ankeren,\nHoe welkom de gastvrijheid zij die ons omgeeft, slechts voor\n  een korte wijl is 't ons veroorloofd er van te genieten.\n\n\n9.\n\nAllons, de drang wordt krachtiger,\nWij zullen onbekende en wilde zeeën bevaren,\nWij zullen het gegier der winden en de stortvloeden der\n  golven trotseeren en gaan waar de Yankee-klipper voortsnelt\n  met volle zeilen.\nAllons! Met kracht, vrijheid, de aarde, de elementen,\nGezondheid, moed, blijheid, zelf-achting, weetgierigheid;\nAllons! weg van alle evangeliën!\nVooral weg van uwe evangeliën, O loensche materialistische\n  priesters.\n\nDie mummie blokkeert den doorgang--wij zullen met het\n  begraven niet langer wachten.\n\n\n10.\n\nLuister! Ik wil oprecht jegens U zijn,\nIk loof niet de oude, smedige prijzen uit, maar ruwe, nieuwe\n  prijzen,\nAldus de zelf-overwinningen die uw deel moeten zijn:\nGij zult U niet ophoopen wat rijkdom genoemd wordt,\nGij zult met kwistige hand uitdeelen wat gij wint of verkrijgt,\nGij zult nauwelijks de stad bereikt hebben die het doel uwer\n  reis was, ter nauwernood hebt gij U er voldaan nedergezet,\n  of gij wordt opgeroepen door een onafwijsbaar bevel om\n  door te gaan,\nGij zult U niet storen aan de ironische glimlachen en den spot\n  van hen die achterblijven,\nWelke liefdewenken gij ook ontvangt, gij moogt enkel antwoorden\n  met hartstochtelijke kussen van afscheid,\nGij zult niet veroorloven, dat zij die de armen naar U uitstrekken\n  U vasthouden.\n\n\n11.\n\nAlles wijkt terug van den voortgang der zielen,\nAlle godsdienstvormen, alle tastbare dingen, kunsten, regeeringen--al\n  wat op deze of welke wereld ook zichtbaar was\n  of is trekt zich terug in nissen en gewelven voor de zielenprocessie\n  langs de verheven wegen des Heelals.\n\nDen voortgang der zielen van mannen en vrouwen langs de\n  verheven wegen des Heelals is alle andere voortgang enkel\n  toevoegsel en steun.\n\nEeuwig leven, eeuwig voorwaarts,\nStatig, plechtig, droef, terughoudend, bespot, woedend, onstuimig,\n  zwak, onvoldaan,\nWanhopig, trotsch, teeder, ziek, erkend door menschen, verloochend\n  door menschen,\nZij gaan! Zij gaan! Ik weet dat zij gaan, maar ik weet niet\n  waarheen zij gaan,\nToch weet ik dat zij heenwaarts gaan naar het beste--heenwaarts\n  naar iets verhevens.\n\nWie gij ook zijt, kom mee! Man of vrouw kom mee!\nGij moet daar niet staan druilen of leuteren in uw huis,\n  ofschoon gij het U bouwdet of het voor U gebouwd is.\n\nWeg uit den duisteren schuilhoek! Weg van achter het schut!\nUwe maren zijn vergeefs, ik weet alles en openbaar alles.\n\nZie door U heen, gij zijt zoo krank als de anderen,\nZie door het lachen, het dansen, het feestvieren der menschen\n  heen,\nZie onder hun kleed en sieraden, zie onder hunne gewasschen,\n  propere gezichten,\nZie dan een geheime, stille walging en wanhoop.\nGeen echtgenoot, geen vrouw, geen vriend vertrouwd genoeg\n  om de belijdenis te ontvangen,\nAls een ander Ik, een dubbelganger van ieder, gaat het\n  schuilend en angstig door het leven,\nVormloos en woordeloos gaat het door de straten der stad,\n  beschaafd en lief in de salons,\nIn spoorwagens, op stoombooten, in openbare bijeenkomsten,\nThuis in de woningen van mannen en vrouwen, aan tafel, in\n  het slaapvertrek, overal,\nKeurig versierd, beleefd-glimlachend, recht van houding: dood\n  in het hart, verdoemenis in het hoofd,\nOnder laken en handschoenen, onder linten en bloemen,\nGebruiken nauwkeurig volgende, met geen syllabe sprekende\n  over zich-zelf,\nSprekende van alle andere dingen ter wereld, maar nooit over\n  zich-zelf.\n\n\n12.\n\nAllons! door gevechten en door strijden!\nHet doel dat wij ons gesteld hebben kan niet worden ontgaan.\n\nWas het einde van vroeger strijden overwinning?\nWat heeft overwonnen? Gij-zelf? Uw volk? de Natuur?\nWelaan, versta mij goed--de Voorzienigheid heeft in het\n  wezen der dingen de eeuwige wet gelegd, dat uit het genot\n  zelf der overwinning, 't hindert niet wat zij geldt, iets groeit,\n  dat een moeilijker strijd noodzakelijk maakt.\n\nMijn roep is de roep ten strijde, ik kweek feitelijke rebellie,\nHij die met mij gaat moet wel gewapend gaan,\nHij die met mij gaat zal dikwijls karig voedsel, armoede, boosaardige\n  vijanden, verlatenheid vinden.\n\n\n13.\n\nAllons! De heirweg ligt voor ons open!\nHij is veilig--ik heb hem beproefd--mijn eigen voeten\n  hebben hem lang en vaak betreden--blijf niet achter!\nLaat het papier liggen op de lessenaar onbeschreven en het\n  boek op de plank ongeopend!\nLaat de gereedschappen liggen in de werkplaats! laat het\n  geld ongeïnd!\nLaat de school voor wat zij is! Stoor U niet aan het geroep\n  des onderwijzers!\nLaat den prediker prediken in zijn preekstoel! laat den\n  advocaat pleiten in het Hof en den rechter de wet verklaren.\n\nCamerado, ik geef U mijn hand!\nIk geef U mijn liefde oneindig kostelijker dan geld,\nIk geef U mij-zelf buiten preek of wet om;\nWilt gij U-zelf aan mij geven? Wilt gij de reis met mij\n  maken?\nZullen wij te zamen en elkaar trouw blijven heel ons leven\n  lang?\n\n\n\n\nUIT: OVER NAAR BROOKLYN MET DE VEERBOOT\n\n\n1.\n\nVloedstroom daar omlaag! Ik zie U van aangezicht tot aangezicht!\nWolken ten Westerhemel--gij daar, zon, ter halfuurshoogte--ook\n  U zie ik van aangezicht tot aangezicht.\n\nMenigten mannen en vrouwen in uw dagelijksch kleed, hoe\n  belangwekkend vind ik U!\nDe honderden en honderden die op de veerbooten naar\n  Brooklyn oversteken om huiswaarts te keeren vind ik belangwekkender\n  dan zij kunnen denken,\nEn gij allen die van oever tot oever zult oversteken in volgende\n  tijden, gij zijt mij meer, gij hebt grooter deel in mijn\n  gepeins dan gij kunt denken.\n\n\n2.\n\nTijd noch plaats doet zich gelden--afstand geldt niet,\nIk ben met U, gij mannen en vrouwen van de volgende generatie\n  of van alle volgende generatiën,\nJuist wat gij gevoelt wanneer gij rivier en hemel gadeslaat,\n  gevoelde ik,\nJuist zooals ieder uwer een mensch in een menigte menschen\n  is, was ik een mensch in een menigte menschen,\nJuist zooals gij U verkwikt gevoelt door het blijde leven van\n  de rivier en den schittervloed, gevoelde ik mij verkwikt,\nJuist zooals gij staat te leunen over de borstwering en toch\n  voortsnelt met den haastigen vloed, stond ik en snelde\n  voort,\nJuist zooals gij ziet naar de tallooze scheepsmasten en de\n  dikstammige schoorsteenen der booten, zag ik.\nOok ik menig en menig keer stak de aloude rivier over,\nSloeg de Twaalfde-maands zeemeeuwen gade, zag hen hoog\n  in de lucht drijven met beweginglooze vleugelen en wiegelende\n  lichamen,\nZag hoe het glinstergeel lichtte op een deel hunner lichamen,\n  terwijl het overige in zwarte schaduw bleef,\nZag ze in langzaam beschreven cirkels zachtkens in het\n  Zuiden dalen,\nZag den weerschijn van zomerlicht in het water,\nWerd verblind soms door den glinsterenden zonnestroom,\nKeek naar de fijn uitsprankelende lichtspaken om de weerspiegeling\n  van mijn hoofd in het zonneweerkaatsende water,\nKeek naar den nevel over den rug der heuvels Zuidwaarts en\n  Zuidwestwaarts,\nKeek naar den stoomdamp in dikke violetgetinte vachten\n  heendrijvende,\nKeek in de richting van den beneden-baaij om de aankomst\n  der schepen te zien,\nZag ze naderen, zag aan boord hen die mij na waren,\nZag de witte zeilen der schoeners, zag de sloepen, zag de\n  schepen voor anker,\nDe matrozen aan hun werk in het want of schrijlings op de\n  sparren,\nDe ronde masten, de schommelende beweging van de kielen,\n  de ranke, kronkelende wimpels,\nDe groote en kleine stoomers in vaart, de loodsen en de\n  loodshuizen,\nHet witte zog in de vaart achtergelaten, de snelle, sidderende\n  wenteling der raderen,\nDe vlaggen aller natiën en hoe zij bij zonsondergang gestreken\n  werden,\nDe uitgeschulpte golven in den schemer, het scheppen der\n  raderborden, het dartelende, glinsterende gekuif,\nHet verre verschiet dat steeds neveliger werd, de grauwe\n  muren van de steenen pakhuizen der dokken,\nOp de rivier het schemerachtig beweeg, de zware stoomsleepers\n  dicht naast elkaar aan weerskanten bij de sloepen,\n  de hooischepen, de door den nacht verraste lichters,\nAan den naderenden oever de vuren der gieterij-schoorsteenen\n  hoog op en helder vlammend in den nacht,\nEn hun flikkering van zwart en bloedrood en geel licht werpende\n  over de daken der huizen en omlaag in de straatspleten.\n\n\n3.\n\nWat is de som der tientallen en honderdtallen jaren, die ons\n  scheiden?\n\nWat het zij, het geldt niet, afstand noch tijd geldt.\nOok ik leefde eens, het Brooklyn der breede heuvelen was\n  mijn Brooklyn,\nOok ik liep in de straten van Manhattan-eiland en baadde in\n  de wateren die het omspoelen,\nOok ik voelde die vreemde plotselinge vragen mijn binnenste\n  bewegen,\nOp den dag midden in de menigte kwamen zij in mij op,\nAls ik in den laten nacht huiswaarts ging, of in bed, kwamen\n  zij in mij op,\nOok ik dobberde in den stroom der eeuwig onopgeloste\n  raadselen,\nOok ik had de identiteit mijns lijfs ontvangen,\nWat ik was wist ik was mijns lijfs en wat ik zou worden wist\n  ik, zou ik worden door het lijf.\n\n\n4.\n\nNiet enkel over U vallen schaduwen,\nOver mij ook zijn schaduwen gegaan,\nHet beste wat ik gedaan had leek mij ijdel en verdacht,\nWaren mijne gedachten die ik zoo verheven waande niet in\n  waarheid zeer onbeduidend?\nEvenmin zijt gij 't alleen die weet wat het is slecht te zijn,\nOok ik wist, wat het is slecht te zijn,\nOok ik verwarde mij in den eeuwigen knoop van tegenstrijdigheid,\nLeuterde, gevoelde schaamte, berouw, wangunst, ik loog\n  en stal,\nWas valsch, toornig, geil, had begeerten die ik zelfs niet\n  durfde uitspreken,\nWas grillig, ijdel, gulzig, bekrompen, sluw, lafhartig, boosaardig,\nDe wolf, de slang, het zwijn leefden in mij,\nDe steelsche blik, het ijdele woord, de overspelige wensch\n  leefde in mij,\nWeigering, haat, uitstel, laagheid, luiheid, dit alles ontbrak\n  mij niet,\nIk was een met de anderen, was een met het leven en de\n  gebeurlijkheid van anderen,\nIk werd bij mijn streelnaam toegeroepen door heldere, luide\n  stemmen van jonge mannen als zij mij zagen naderen of\n  voorbijgaan,\nVoelde hun arm om mijn nek als ik stond, of het achteloos\n  leunen van hun lichaam tegen het mijne als ik zat,\nZag velen die ik liefhad in de straten of op de veerbooten of\n  in openbare bijeenkomsten en sprak hun toch met geen\n  woord van die liefde,\nLeefde hetzelfde leven der anderen, hetzelfde oude, lachende,\n  knagende, slapende leven,\nSpeelde de rol die altijd den speler of de speelster zal blijven\n  nastaren,\nAltijd dezelfde oude rol, de rol die is wat wij er van maken,\n  zoo groot als wij wenschen,\nOf zoo klein als wij wenschen, of beiden groot en klein\n  tegelijk.\n\n\n5.\n\nO, wat kan mij ooit luistervoller en schooner zijn dan het\n  mastomboorde Manhattan?\nRivier en zonsondergang en geschulpte golven van den vloedstroom?\nDe zeemeeuwen en hunne wiegelende lichamen, het hooischip\n  in den schemer en den lichter in den nacht?\nWat zijn heerlijker goden dan die mij de hand drukken en mij\n  met stemmen, lieflijk voor mijne ooren, luide en krachtig\n  bij mijn streelnaam toeroepen als ik voorbijga?\nWat is teerder dan wat mij verbindt aan de vrouw of den\n  man die mij nu aanziet?\nEn mij nu met U vereenigt en mijn ziel in de uwe doet leven?\n\nWant wij begrijpen elkander, doen we niet?\nWat ik U beloofde zonder het te noemen, hebt gij dat niet\n  aanvaard?\nWat de geleerdheid niet kan onderwijzen--wat het sermoen\n  niet kan vervullen, is nu vervuld, niet waar?\n\n\n6.\n\nStroom voort, rivier! Zwel aan met den vloed, neem af met de\n  ebbe!\nDartelt voort, gekuifde en geschulpte golven!\nHeerlijke wolken van zonsondergang! doordringt mij van uw\n  pracht, of de mannen en vrouwen van alle volgende\n  generatiën!\nSteekt over van oever tot oever, ontelbare menigten passagiers!\nVerheft U, hooge masten van Manhattan! Verheft U, schoone\n  heuvelen van Brooklyn!\nKlop, bedrogen en wonderlijk brein! Werp uw vragen en antwoorden\n  uit!\nSleurt hier en overal met U voort, stroom van eeuwig onopgeloste\n  raadselen,\nStaart oogen van dorstende liefde, staart in huis of op straat\n  of in de openbare bijeenkomst!\nKlinkt op, stemmen van jonge mannen! roept mij luide en\n  welklinkend bij mijn speelnaam!\nLeef, oud leven! Speel de rol die hem of haar die speelt\n  eeuwig achterna staart,\nSpeel de oude rol, de rol die groot is of klein, naar men\n  haar maken wil.\nBedenk wel, gij die mij leest, of ik U niet onzichtbaar aanzie;\nZij sterk, borstwering boven het water, steun hen die achteloos\n  tegen U aanleunen en zich toch met den stroom\n  meehaasten;\nVliegt voort, zeevogels! Vliegt op uwe zijde of wentelt in\n  wijde cirkels hoog in de lucht;\nWeerkaats den zomerhemel, gij water en bewaart hem tot\n  aller neerziende oogen tijd hebben gehad U te zien,\nSprankelt uit fijne zonnelichtspaken om de weerspiegeling in\n  het zonbeschenen water van mijn hoofd of ieders hoofd!\nNadert schepen in den beneden-baaij! Vaart op en af witbezeilde\n  schoeners, sleepen, lichters!\nPraalt uit, aller natiën vlaggen! Wordt naar behooren gestreken\n  bij zonsondergang!\nBrandt uwe vuren hoog op, gij gieterij-schoorsteenen! Werpt\n  zwarte schaduwen in het vallen van den avond, werpt rood\n  en geel licht over de daken der huizen!\nVerschijnselen bewijst nu of in de toekomst wat gij zijt,\nGij noodzakelijke nevel omhul de ziel,\nVoor mij om mijn lijf, voor U om uw lijf, geuren de goddelijkste\n  aroma's,\nGedijt steden--brengt uwe ladingen, brengt uwe fiere\n  schouwspelen, breede en genoegzame wateren,\nBloei op, Wezen dat misschien meer ziel heeft dan al wat leeft,\nBehoudt uwe plaatsen, dingen, duurzamer dan al het andere.\n\nGij hebt gewacht, gij wacht altijd, stomme heerlijke getuigers,\nWij nemen U gretig in ons op en toch blijven wij steeds\n  onverzadigd,\nZoo abel zijt gij niet, dat gij ons kunt teleurstellen of U-zelven\n  buiten ons bereik houden,\nWij nemen U in ons op en verwerpen U niet--wij bevestigen\n  U voor altijd in ons hart,\nWij vademen U niet--wij hebben U lief--ook in U is volmaaktheid,\nGij zijt ook een deel der eeuwigheid,\nGroot of klein, gij zijt een deel van de ziel.\n\n\n\n\nUIT: LIED VAN DE BREEDE BIJL\n\n\nKracht, beleid en moed, dat is het hoogste!\nWat het leven sterkt, sterkt tevens den dood,\nEn de dooden zijn in de processie des levens even goed als\n  de levenden zelf,\nEn de zekerheid der toekomst staat even rotsvast als die\n  van het heden,\nWant de teelkracht der aarde en der menschheid is hetzelfde\n  als de ziel der aarde en der menschheid,\nEn niets is blijvender dan de kracht die een man stempelt\n  tot man.\n\nWat, denkt gij, is blijvend?\nDenkt gij, dat een groote stad blijvend is?\nOf een staat, waarin de nijverheid bloeit?

Clio,\n  Melpomene, Thalia!\nStil nu, de plechtige rhytmen van Una en Oriana, niemand\n  nu zoekt meer den Heiligen Graal,\nJeruzalem, een handvol koude asch in de winden geworpen,\nDe middernacht-duistere heiren der kruisvaarders verdwenen\n  voor het licht van den morgenstond,\nAmadis, Tancred namen slechts, Charlemagne, Roelant,\n  Olivier namen slechts,\nPalmerijn en de bietebouw vergeten, verdwenen het torengespiegel\n  in de wateren der Usk,\nDood koning Arthur en zijne ridders, Merlijn en Lancelot en\n  Galahad heengegaan, weggetrokken allen als de ademwas\n  op glimmend staal,\nDood! Dood! Voor ons en voor alle tijden dood, die eenmaal\n  zoo machtige wereld, die nu ledige, onbezielde schimmenwereld,\nDie gulden, verblindende wonderwereld met al hare heerlijke\n  legenden en mythen,\nHare koningen en fiere kasteelen, hare priesters en strijdvaardige\n  ridders en schoone riddervrouwen,\nDood, de lijken in de wade, in de rusting, gedekt door de\n  kroon, bijgezet in het knekelgewelf.\nToen, in zijn koninklijke dicht, schalde Shakespeare hun\n  dood uit met de klaroen der eeuwen,\nEn heeft Tennyson's liefelijk, droevig rijm den lijkzang gezongen.\n\nIk zeg, vrienden, ik, zooal gij niet, zie de verheven zoekster,\n  ('t is waar, hoewel altijd dezelfde, sinds dien veel veranderd\n  op haar reis door eeuwen en landen,)\nEn, bezield als ooit, streeft zij er naar ons te vinden, met\n  kracht haar weg banende dwars door de warreling heen,\nNiet afgeschrikt door het gegons der machines en de schrille\n  stoomfluit,\nVindt zij draineer-pijpen, gazometers en fertilisators niet beneden\n  haar aandacht,\nGlimlachend, bekoord, blijkbaar besloten bij ons te blijven,\nDaar is zij! onze moeder, onze vrouw, onze zuster, en bereidt\n  ons middagmaal!\n\n\n4.\n\nMaar hoe? Weet ik niet langer hoe 't behoort?\nIk leid de gast, O Columbia, uw huis binnen; (en wat anders\n  zou dan mijn levensdoel en dezer zangen doel zijn?)\nIn naam der vrijheid een onsterflijk Welkom! Laat ons\n  juichen dat Europa tot ons komt!\nEn in het altijd en eeuwig der toekomst zijt beiden mijne\n  lieve zusters, oude en nieuwe wereld.\n\nVrees niet, Muze! Een echt nieuw leven en een echte nieuwe\n  tijd ontvangen U en zullen U bezielen,\nIk beken u oprecht, mijn volk is een vreemd, een wonderlijk\n  volk, het doet zijn eigen nieuwe doen,\nToch vindt gij er dezelfde oude menschheid in, dezelfde van\n  binnen en van buiten,\nDezelfde gezichten en harten, hetzelfde gevoel, hetzelfde\n  smachten naar het onbereikbare,\nDezelfde oude liefde, oude schoonheid, hetzelfde oude leven.\n\n\n5.\n\nZwijge dan de verheerlijking van den oorlog, zwijge dan\n  oorlog zelf,\nWeg van mijn huiverend zien, en dat het nimmer terugkome,\n  dat veld vol zwart gebrande, verminkte lijken!\nDie onbeschrijflijke hel met stroomen bloeds, waar ontketende\n  tijgers en wolven, wier tong uit den muil hangt, geen\n  denkende menschen zich in verlustigen,\nEn daarvoor: verheft U, strijd van denkende hoofden en\n  nijvere handen,\nKomt met onversaagde legerscharen, machinenbouwers,\nKom met uwe vaandels, arbeid, laat hen dartelen op den\n  wind,\nLaat luide en klaar uwe trompetten schallen.\n\nZwijge dan de oude roman!\nZwijge novelle, spijt en spel van hovelingen,\nZwijge het minnelied van suikerzoete rijmen, het lied dat\n  lusten en liefden van lediggangers bezingt,\nEnkel geschikt om gezongen te worden bij het banketteeren\n  in den nacht, als de late dansers huppelen op de maat\n  van vroolijke klanken,\nDe ongezonde genoegens en buitensporige vermaken der\n  enkelen,\nIn geuren, gloed en wijn, onder het schitterlicht der kaarsen.\n\nVoor U eerbiedwekkende, krachtige zusteren,\nVerhef ik mijn stem om kunst en dichter te bezielen voor\n  onderwerpen die hunner waardiger zijn dan dezen.\nDat kunst en dichter het heden en de realiteit verheffen,\nDat de dichter niet voor enkelen zinge, maar voor den middelmaat-mensch\n  en diens roem van dagelijkschen wandel\n  en handel,\nDat hij in liederen roeme arbeid en het gistend leven, en hoe\n  dezen grootscher zijn dan alles,\nDat hij bezinge den handenarbeid van ieder en allen, het\n  ploegen, wieden en graven,\nHet planten en kweeken van den boom, van den boomstruik,\n  het moesbed en de bloemen,\nDe dichter zegge, dat iedere man zijn grootsche taak in het\n  leven heeft en vervult en iedere vrouw tevens;\nDe dichter zegge: neem hamer en zaag ter hand en gevoel\n  U-zelf hoog,\nHij zinge het lied van den timmerman, den stuc-werker, den\n  schilder,\nHet lied van den kleêrmaker en kleêrmaakster, van de\n  dienstmaagd, van den stalknecht en den portier,\nEn vooral prijze hij het vernuft, dat het wasschen, koken en\n  reinigen helpt door kleine uitvinding,\nEn vooral achte hij 't niet beneden zich-zelf de hand aan\n  den arbeid te leggen, welke ook.\n\nIk zeg: ik breng U, Muze, heden en hier,\nAllen arbeid en allen plicht, verheven of gewoon,\nIk breng U het zwoegen, het gezonde zwoegen in het zweet,\n  het eindeloos zwoegen zonder rust,\nIk breng U de oude lasten van het werkzame leven en zijne\n  belangen en zijne vreugden,\nHet huisgezin, de bloedverwantschap, kinderen, man en\n  vrouw,\nDe welvaart van het huis, het huis zelf en wat het huis\n  toebehoort,\nLevensmiddelen en het conserveeren van levensmiddelen,\n  door de scheikunde geholpen,\nEn al wat den mensch sterk maakt, den gezonden man, de\n  gezonde vrouw, den volkomen lang levenden mensch,\nWat dien mensch in dit leven gezondheid en geluk schenkt en\n  zijn ziel loutert,\nVoor het eeuwige toekomstige leven.\n\nDàn de jongste paringen der volken, hun arbeid, het onderling\n  verkeer der werelddeelen,\nDe stoomkracht, de sneltreinspoorwegen, gas en petroleum,\nAl deze triomfen van onzen tijd: de kabels van den Atlantischen\n  Oceaan,\nDe Pacifiek-spoorwegen, het Suez-kanaal, de Mont-Cenis,\n  Gothard en Hoosac tunnels, de Brooklyn-brug,\nDeze geheele aarde door ijzeren banden omspannen, met de\n  stoomvaartlijnen die als draden over de zeeën zijn getrokken,\nDezen wereldkloot in zijn tuimeling door het heelal breng\n  ik U.\n\n\n\n\nUIT: EEN LIED VOOR DEN ARBEID\n\n\n1.\n\nEen lied voor den arbeid!\nIn den arbeid van machines en in den handarbeid en in den\n  arbeid op de velden vind ik de verklaring der godskrachten,\nVind ik de godskracht zelf.\n\nArbeiders en arbeidsters!\nIndien alle geleerdheid en haar nut en haar fraai mij ontstraalde,\n  zou dat dan veel zijn?\nIndien ik een geleerd professor, een liefdadig landheer, een\n  wijs staatsman ware, zou dat dan veel zijn?\nIndien ik U was wat de patroon is die U in dienst neemt en\n  betaalt, zou U dat bevredigen?\n\nDe geleerde, de brave, de weldadige en dan nog dit: de\n  banaliteit,\nNeem een man als ik: geleerd, braaf noch weldadig misschien,\n  maar de banaliteit verre.\n\nIk dienaar noch meester,\nIk verlang niet eerder het vele dan het weinige, wie ook\n  van mij geniet, ik verlang slechts wat mij toekomt,\nIk wil uw gelijke zijn en gij zult mijn gelijke zijn.\nIndien gij aan de werkbank staat in de werkplaats, sta ik U\n  zoo na als de naaste aan dezelfde bank,\nIndien gij uw broeder of liefsten vriend beschenkt vraag ik\n  van U hetzelfde als gij aan broeder of liefsten vriend\n  schenkt,\nIndien uw minnaar, man, vrouw u dag en nacht lief is, moet\n  ik persoonlijk U even lief zijn,\nIndien gij geschandvlekt, misdadig, ongelukkig wordt, zal ik\n  dat worden om uwentwil,\nIndien gij U uwe dwaze wetschennende daden herinnert,\n  zult gij dan denken dat ik mij niet herinner mijne eigen\n  dwaze, wetschennende daden?\nIndien gij in het drinkgelag aan tafel zit, zit ik in het\n  drinkgelag tegenover U aan die tafel,\nIndien gij een vreemde ontmoet in de straten en hem of\n  haar uw liefde schenkt, o ik ontmoet vele vreemden en\n  schenk hun mijn liefde,\n\nNu, wat denkt gij dan van U-zelf?\nHebt gij gering gedacht van U-zelf?\nHebt gij den President hooger gesteld dan U-zelf?\nOf den rijke er beter aan toe dan gij? Of de geschoolde\n  wijzer dan gij?\n(Omdat uw gezicht vuil of puistig is, of omdat gij eens dronken\n  of een dief waart,\nOf omdat gij ziekelijk, of rheumatisch, of een lichtekooi zijt,\nOf omdat uw kracht gering is of gebroken, of omdat gij geen\n  vat vol geleerdheid zijt en uw naam nooit gedrukt hebt\n  gezien,\nLeidt gij daarvan af, dat gij iets minder onsterflijk zijt?)\n\n\n2.\n\nZielen van mannen en vrouwen! U noem ik niet onzichtbaar,\n  onhoorbaar, ongevoelig en onvoelbaar,\nIk zal mij niet bemoeien voor of tegen U te pleiten om uit\n  te maken of gij al dan niet bestaat,\nIk erken openlijk wie gij zijt, al erkent niemand anders dat.\n\nVolwassen, halfwassen, kind, van dit volk of elk ander volk,\n  in huis of buitenshuis, ik zie in den een dezelfde waarde\n  als in den ander,\nEn ik zie al het andere door hen heen en achter hen.\n\nIk zie de vrouw en zij is geen zier minder dan haar man,\nIk zie de dochter en zij is even goed als de zoon,\nIk zie de moeder en zij is de volkomen gelijke van den\n  vader.\n\nKinderen van den onwetende en den behoeftige, knapen die\n  opgeleid worden in een vak,\nJonge mannen die bij den boer werken en oude mannen die\n  bij den boer werken,\nMatrozen, sjouwers, kustvaarders, landverhuizers,\nIk zie ze allen en zij zijn mij na, ik zie ver weg anderen en\n  zij zijn mij na,\nNiet een ontgaat mij, en niet een wenscht mij te ontgaan.\n\nIk breng U wat gij 't meeste behoeft en toch steeds hebt\n  bezeten,\nHet is geen geld, amours, kleed, eten, geleerdheid, maar het\n  is even goed,\nIk zend geen zaakwaarnemer of tusschenman, bied U geen\n  wissel van de waarde aan, maar geef U de waarde zelf.\n\nDaar is iets dat den mensch invloeit nu en steeds,\nNiet in gedrukte woorden, noch in gepreekte of gepraten\n  woorden kan men 't vinden, het ontsnapt aan die woorden,\nNiet in een boek, niet in dit boek is 't te vinden,\nWie gij ook zijt het is 't uwe, het 'is niet verder van U dan\n  uw gehoor of uw gezicht,\nWat U het naaste, het gewoonste, het gereedste is spreekt er\n  U van en daaruit komt het U immer te gemoet.\n\nLees in vele talen, toch leest gij hierover niets,\nLees de Boodschap van den President en gij leest ook\n  daarin niets hier over,\nNiet in de rapporten van het Binnenlandsch Ministerie of\n  van het Ministerie van Financiën, niets in dagbladen of\n  weekbladen,\nNiets in de belasting- of pensioenberichten, niets in de prijsnoteeringen\n  of de mededeelingen van de Beurs.\n\n\n3.\n\nDe zon en de kringloopende sterren in het firmament,\nDe appelvormige aarde en wij met ons leven van die aarde,\n  het is grootsch in zijn eeuwig gedobber,\nIk weet niet wàt het is behalve dat het grootsch is en dat\n  het geluk is,\nEn dat de beteekenis van ons leven niet ligt in een bespiegeling\n  of een bon-mot of eenig onderzoek,\nEn dat het niet iets is, dat bij geluk ten goede kan keeren\n  en bij ongeluk ons kan ontgaan,\nEn niet iets, dat wij door een of andere omstandigheid\n  kunnen verliezen,\nHet licht en de schaduw, de wonderbare beteekenis van het\n  lichaam en zijn identiteit met de ziel, de tuk die met\n  volkomen bereidwilligheid alle aardsche dingen verslindt,\nDe alomvattende fierheid en het kunnen van den mensch,\n  zijn onuitsprekelijke vreugden en smarten,\nHet wonder dat iedereen ziet in iedereen dien hij ziet en\n  de wonderen die elke minuut der komende tijden van zich\n  zullen vervullen,\nWat is het doel van dit alles, dacht gij, Camerado?\nDacht gij dat het enkel was voor uw handwerk of landwerk?\n  of voor de winsten van uw winkel?\nOf om U aan een of andere betrekking te helpen? Of voor\n  een spelletje in het beuzeluur van dezen heer en die\n  dame?\nHebt gij gedacht dat het landschap leven, vorm en kleur had\n  enkel om in een schilderij geschilderd te worden?\nEn dat de menschen leefden enkel opdat men hun leven\n  konde beschrijven of bezingen,\nOf dat de zwaartekracht en de natuurwetten en de harmonieuze\n  samenstelling van het Heelal en de luchtstroomingen\n  enkel waren om aan schoolmeesters geleerdheid te\n  verschaffen?\nOf dat het bruine land en de blauwe zee waren voor de\n  atlassen en de landkaarten?\nOf de sterren om in sterrengroepen verdeeld te worden en\n  dan aangeduid bij fantasie-namen?\nOf dat de groei en ontluiking der zaden zijn voor landbouwkundige\n  tabellen of den landbouw zelf?\n\nOude instellingen, kunsten, boeken, verhalen en de vaardigheid\n  in een beroep, zullen wij dit alles hoog stellen?\nZullen wij ons eigendom, onzen handel hoog stellen? Ik heb\n  er niets tegen.\nIk stel dit alles even hoog als het hoogste--maar boven dit\n  hoogste stel ik het kind dat geboren wordt van eene\n  vrouw en een man.\n\n\n4.\n\nDe som van al wat eerbied verdient tel ik op in U, wie gij\n  ook zijt,\nDe President bevindt zich in het Witte Huis om uwentwil,\n  gij zijt niet hier ter wille van hem,\nDe secretarissen arbeiden in hun bureaux voor U, gij arbeidt\n  niet voor hen,\nHet Congres vergadert elke Twaalfde Maand voor U,\nWetten, hoven, staatsconstituties, stedelijke charters, het\n  komen en trekken van handel en verkeer, dit alles is\n  voor U.\nLuistert goed, lieve discipelen,\nLeer, staatkunde, beschaving vloeien uit U,\nStandbeelden en monumenten en alle roem-inschriften waar\n  ook zijn gehouwen in U,\nDe waarde van geschiedenis en statistiek, zoo ver als haar\n  geest het verleden mag zijn doorgedrongen, bevindt zich\n  dit uur in U en die van mythen en verhalen evenzoo,\nIndien gij op dit oogenblik geen adem haddet en geen\n  kracht, wat zou er van hen allen zijn?\nHet heerlijke epos zou niets zijn en oratiën en tragediën\n  zouden ledig zijn.\n\nDe paleizen zijn wat gij er van maakt als uw oog hen aanschouwt,\n(Dacht gij dat hun waarde lag in den witten of grijzen steen?\n  Of in de lijnen hunner bogen en kroonlijsten?)\n\nDe muziek is wat er uit uw ziel opvloeit als de instrumenten\n  U aan uw werkelijk leven doen denken,\nZij is niet de violen en cornetten, niet de hobo noch de\n  trommen, noch de klanken van den bariton-zanger die zijn\n  liefelijke romanza zingt, noch die van het mannenkoor,\n  noch die van vrouwenkoor,\nZij is dichter bij en verder dan dezen.\n\n\n5.\n\nZal dan alles eenmaal zijn weg terug afleggen?\nKan dan ieder de eeuwige schoonheid zien door een blik in\n  den spiegel? Is daar niets hoogers of beters?\nBevat gij alles, bevat de mystiek-onzichtbare ziel alles?\nEn vreemd en zwaar zeker is mijn paradox;\nHet ruwste ter wereld en de onzichtbare ziel der wereld\n  zijn één.\n\n\n6.\n\nWilt gij dan de zaligheid verre zoeken? Gij zult zeker op\n  uwe schreden terugkomen.\nIn de dingen uws dagelijkschen levens vindt gij het beste, of\n  zoo goed als het beste,\nIn de menschen uws dagelijkschen levens vindt gij de edelste,\n  krachtigste, liefdewaardigste!\nGeluk, kennis vindt gij niet elders maar hier, niet in de\n  toekomst maar nu,\nIn den man dien gij 't eerst ziet en aanraakt vindt gij altijd\n  een vriend, een broeder, een naasten buur--in de vrouw\n  een moeder, zuster, vrouw,\nDe liefde en de arbeid der volken hebben de eerste plaats\n  in poëmen en overal,\nGij arbeidsters en arbeiders dezer Staten, gij bezit uw eigen\n  goddelijk en krachtvol leven,\nEn alles daarbuiten heeft plaats voor mannen en vrouwen\n  zooals gij.\n\nWanneer de psalm gaat zingen in steê van den zanger,\nWanneer de Schrift zal prediken in steê van den leeraar,\nWanneer de kansel afdaalt en onder de menschen gaat in\n  steê van den prediker,\nWanneer ik bij dag of bij nacht het lichaam van boeken kan\n  beroeren en zij dan mijn lichaam beroeren in keer,\nWanneer eens professors collegie zooveel bewijst als een sluimerende\n  vrouw of een slapend kind,\nWanneer de goudstukken in de kelders glimlachen als des\n  nachtwakers dochter,\nWanneer de gevolmachtigde bazelt in den presidentsstoel en\n  ik zijn vriend ben en metgezel,\nDan, en niet eerder, zal ik dezen de hand reiken en hen zoo\n  hoog verheffen als ik U doe, mannen en vrouwen aan den\n  arbeid.\n\n\n\n\nUIT: LIED VAN DE WENTELENDE AARDE\n\n\n1.\n\nEen lied van de wentelende aarde, in woorden die met haar\n  harmonieeren,\nDacht gij dat dit de woorden zijn, deze rechtoppe-lijntjes,\n  deze boogjes, hoekjes, en stipjes?\nNeen, dat zijn de woorden niet, de echte woorden zijn in de\n  aarde en in de zee,\nZij zijn in de lucht, zij zijn in U.\n\nDacht gij dat deze woorden de liefelijke klanken zijn door\n  den mond uws vriends gesproken?\nNeen, de ware woorden zijn liefelijker dan deze.\n\nMenschenlijven zijn woorden, myriaden woorden,\n(In de beste gedichten ziet gij altijd het lijf van man of\n  vrouw, altijd welgevormd, natuurlijk, levensvol,\nEn elk deel vol kracht om te geven of te ontvangen zonder\n  schaamte of reden tot schaamte.)\n\nLucht, aarde, water, vuur--de elementen zijn de woorden,\nIk zelf ben een woord met dezen--mijne krachten vloeien\n  samen met de hunne--mijn naam is voor hen een niets,\nAl wierd mijn naam ook genoemd in de drie duizend talen,\n  wat zouden lucht, aarde, water, vuur weten van mijn naam?\nEen gezond gezicht, een vriendelijk bemoedigend gebaar zijn\n  woorden, en zij zijn welsprekendheid en wijsheid,\nDe bekoring van den oogopslag van sommige mannen en\n  vrouwen, ook zij is vol welsprekendheid en wijsheid.\n\nHet werk waaruit de ziel spreekt is het poëem dier onhoorbare\n  woorden der aarde,\nDe meesters kennen die aarde-woorden en zeggen daarin\n  meer dan in hoorbare woorden.\nDe aarde ontbloot haar schoonheid niet doch weigert ook niet\n  haar schoonheid te ontblooten, niettemin is haar onzichtbaar\n  leven het schoonste,\nDring in haar door en gij verneemt luid-hoorbare klanken,\n  het verheven koorgezang der helden, de weeklachten der\n  slaven,\nDe eeden der liefde, vervloekingen, doodsnikken van stervenden,\n  gelach van jongelieden, geschreeuw van markters,\nDring in haar door om de sleutelwoorden te kennen die\n  nooit missen.\n\nDe woorden der welsprekende, stomme eeuwe-moeder tot\n  hare kinderen missen nooit,\nDe echte woorden missen nooit, want de slag mist nooit en\n  de terugslag mist nooit,\nAldus ook missen nimmer de dag en de nacht, evenmin als\n  onze reis door de eeuwigheid mist.\n\nHet Godsschip bevaart de Godszee,\nRondwentelend, staag, om nimmer te vergaan,\nZonneschijn, storm, koude, hitte voor altijd weerstaat, voorbij\n  snelt, draagt het dezen,\nDe waarheid en de bestemming der ziel bevat het,\nHet vloeiende ledig in 't rond en vooruit klieft en doordringt\n  het,\nEn steeds voort, door geen tegenspoed opgehouden, door\n  geen anker vastgehouden, door geen klip geraakt,\nVlug, vroolijk, voldaan, niets dervende, niets verliezende,\nElk oogenblik in staat en bereid het logboek open te slaan,\nHet Godsschip bevaart de Godszee.\n\n\n2.\n\nWie gij ook zijt! Slag en terugslag zijn bepaaldelijk voor U,\nHet Godsschip bevaart de Godszee voor U.\n\nWie gij ook zijt! Gij zijt de man of de vrouw voor wie de\n  aarde vast en vloeibaar is,\nGij zijt de man of de vrouw voor wie zon en maan daar zijn\n  in het firmament,\nVoor niemand eerder dan voor U is het heden en het verleden,\nVoor niemand zekerder dan voor U is de onsterflijkheid.\n\nIeder man is voor zich en iedere vrouw is voor zich het sleutelwoord\n  van verleden en heden en dat der onsterflijkheid;\nNiet een kan daar verwerven voor den ander--niet een,\nNiet een daar leven voor den ander--niet een.\nHet gezang is voor den zanger en komt tot hem terug,\nHet onderwijs is voor den onderwijzer en komt tot hem terug,\nDe moord is voor den moordenaar en komt tot hem terug,\nDe diefstal is voor den dief en komt tot hem terug,\nDe liefde is voor hem die liefde geeft en komt tot hem terug,\nDe gift is voor den gever en komt tot hem terug--het\n  kan niet missen,\nDe redevoering is voor den redenaar, het spel is voor den\n  tooneelspeler en speelster niet voor het gehoor,\nEn geen mensch verstaat grootheid en goedheid dan de zijne\n  of die door de zijne wordt verklaard.\n\n\n3.\n\nIk zweer de aarde zal gewis hem of haar volkomen zijn die\n  zelf volkomen is,\nEn de aarde zal gehavend en gebroken blijven hem of haar\n  die zelf gehavend en gebroken blijft.\n\nIk zweer daar is grootheid noch vermogen die wedijvert met\n  de grootheid en het vermogen der aarde,\nDaar kan geen leer welke ook zijn, ten ware zij worde bevestigd\n  door die der aarde,\nGeen staatkunde, poëzie, religie, zede of wat ook, tenzij\n  gegrondvest in de aarde,\nTenzij oog in oog met de stiptheid, levenskracht, onpartijdigheid,\n  rechtschapenheid dezer aarde.\n\nIk zweer ik zie in de liefde liefelijker krampen dan die de\n  liefde oproept,\nHet is zelf-bezit dat nooit lokt of afwijst.\nIk zweer ik zie weinig of niets meer in hoorbare woorden,\n't Vloeit alles opwaarts tot de ongezegde waarheden dezer\n  aarde,\nTot hem die zingt de zangen des lijfs en zegt de waarheden\n  der aarde,\nTot hem die woordenboeken maakt van de woorden die aan\n  den druk ontsnappen.\n\nIk zweer ik zie wat daar beter is dan het beste te noemen,\nHet is het beste altijd en immer ongenoemd te laten.\n\nZoodra ik mij ondersta het beste te noemen merk ik mijn\n  krachteloosheid,\nDan ligt mijn tong verlamd onder mijn verhemelte,\nDan weigert mijn adem mijne longen te vullen,\nIk word met stomheid geslagen.\nHet beste der aarde kan niet, kan nooit genoemd worden,\n  alles en ieder is het beste,\nDat beste is niet wat gij vermoeddet, het is veiler, lichter,\n  nader,\nNiets behoeft er voor uit zijn natuurlijke voegen te worden\n  gelicht,\nDe aarde is even zeker en direct nu als zij was voorheen,\nFeiten, religiën, vooruitgang, beleid, handel en wandel zijn\n  nu zoo reëel als voorheen,\nEn ook de ziel is reëel, ook zij is zeker en direct,\nGeen preek of proef heeft haar bewezen,\nOnloochenbare vooruitgang bewijst haar.\n\n\n4.\n\nDat dan in deze zangen weergalmen de klanken der ziel en\n  de melodieën der ziel,\n(Indien zij niet den weergalm bevatten van de melodieën der\n  ziel, wat zouden zij dan zijn?\nIndien zij niet leven waren direct van uw leven, wat zouden\n  zij dan zijn?)\n\nIk zweer voortaan zal ik niets meer gemeen hebben met den\n  godsdienst die het beste noemt,\nIk wil enkel gemeen hebben met den godsdienst die het beste\n  ongemoeid laat.\n\nSpreekt sprekers, zingt zangers!\nDelft diep, vormt groot, stapelt hoog de woorden der aarde!\nArbeidt, eeuwen na eeuwen, want niets zal verloren gaan,\nMisschien zal uw arbeid lang hebben te wachten, maar zeker\n  zult gij er de wel-daad van zien,\nWanneer de bouwstoffen allen bereid en gereed zijn, zullen\n  de bouwmeesters verschijnen.\n\nIk zweer U, de bouwmeesters zullen verschijnen onafwijsbaar,\nIk zweer U, dat zij U zullen verstaan en rechtvaardigen,\nDe verhevenste onder hen zal hij zijn die U het beste van\n  allen verstaat, en die allen verklaart en allen getrouw is,\nHij en zijne makkers zullen U niet vergeten, zij zullen inzien,\n  dat gij niet een jota minder zijt dan zij zelven,\nIn hen en door hen zult gij volkomen verheerlijkt worden.\n\n\n\n\nLIED DES HEELALS\n\n\n1.\n\nKom, zei de Muze,\nZing thans een lied door geen dichter nog gezongen,\nZing thans het lied des Heelals.\nIn deze onze ruwe aarde,\nMiddenin den onpeilbaren chaos,\nVerborgen en veilig in haar hart,\nKiemt het zaad der volmaaktheid.\nIn allen leven kiemt dit zaad,\nGeen geboorte zonder de ontkieming van dit zaad, verborgen\n  of zichtbaar, dit zaad ontvangt bloei.\n\n\n2.\n\nHeil U, waakzame, hoogstrevende wetenschap,\nGij die, als van hooge bergtoppen, het jonge leven overziet,\nEn verder steeds en verder Uw uitkomsten bevestigt.\nMaar heil, heil, heil der ziele, die alle wetenschap overtreft,\nVoor haar heeft de wereldgeschiedenis zich als een schel om\n  den aardkloot gelegd,\nVoor haar wentelen alle sterren-myriaden door 't Heelal.\nVoor haar, spiralend omhoog en breed van slagen,\n(Of als een schip op zee, dat vaak boegseert)\nVloeit wat vergankelijk is uit in het Eeuwige\nEn strekt de realiteit zich uit naar 't ideaal.\nVoor haar de ontwikkeling van het al, die niet in wezen, wèl\n  in schijn wordt gekend,\nEn rechtvaardiging is niet enkel van het goede, maar van\n  wat wij slecht noemen tevens.\nEenmaal werpt ieder den mom af, wat deze ook waard zij,\nEenmaal bloeit er heil uit alle verzwering, eenmaal vreugde\n  uit list, bedrog en tranen,\nHeil waar de kracht aan ontspringt en vreugde, vreugde des\n  Heelals.\nUit het gros, uit het ongezonde, uit het onbeteekenende,\nUit de middelmatige meerderheid, het talloos-vake bedrog\n  van menschen en volken,\nOntspringt het goede,\nAlom dan het goede, electrisch, bederfwerend, alles doordringend,\n  alles vervullend.\n\n\n3.\n\nBoven de berghoogten van kwalen en smarten,\nFladdert, fladdert en zweeft een nooit-gelamde vogel\nHoog in de reine sferen des geluks,\nDoor de duisterste wolken der onvolkomenheid,\nBreekt altijd een glimp van 't reinste licht der zon,\nEen straal der hemel-heerlijkheid-zelve.\nIn de wangeluiden van zeden en gebruiken\nIn het dolle Babyloonsch geraas, in oorverdoovende orgiën,\nElk getier overruischende, wordt een toon gehoord, en niet\n  meer dan vernomen,\nVan 't koorgezang der eeuwen in verre hemelgewesten gezongen.\nO, de zegenvolle oogen, o, de gelukkige harten\nDie in 't geweldig labyrinth,\nDen teederen leiddraad zien en volgen kunnen.\n\n\n4.\n\nEn gij, Amerika,\nAls bekroning van het godsplan, in zijn overleg en in zijn\n  uitvoering,\nZijt gij--en niet om U zelfs wil--tot leven geroepen.\nWant ook gij omvat alles,\nGij torscht en ontvangt alles en begroet alles, ook langs\n  paden breed en

voortdurende verheffing der natuur beschenkt het Al\n  met haar zegeningen,\nDe bloesem draagt vrucht, de vrucht der eeuwen rijpt, de\n  gaarden worden godstuinen, de oogst is zeker,\nAldus rijpt alles: vormen, voorwerpen, ontwikkeling, menschheid\n  tot het leven der zaligheid,\n\nGeef dan, o God, mij altijd die gedachte, opdat altijd mijn\n  ziel hoog zij en zinge,\nGeef mij, geef hem of

O Pioniers!\n\n\n\n\nAAN U\n\n\nWie gij ook zijt, ik vrees gij gaat den weg der droomen,\nIk weet, dat de werkelijkheid waarop gij meent te rusten\n  sneeuw is, die U onder handen en voeten wegsmelt,\nZelfs op dit oogenblik zie ik alles wat gij 't Uwe meent\n  verdwijnen: Uw gezicht, Uw vreugden, woorden, huis, handel,\n  wandel, verdriet, dwaasheden, gewoonten, misdaden,\nUw ware ziel, Uw ware lichaam verschijnt mij,\nVerschijnt mij, opkomende uit Uw bedrijf, Uw zaken, Uw\n  winkel, arbeid, hofsteê, kleed, uit uw koop en verkoop,\n  eten, drinken, lijden en doodgaan.\n\nWie gij ook zijt, ik leg nu de hand op Uw hoofd, opdat gij\n  mijn gedicht moogt zijn,\nEn met mijne lippen dicht aan Uwe ooren fluister ik:\nIk heb vele vrouwen en mannen innig liefgehad, maar voor\n  geen hunner was mijn liefde inniger dan voor U.\n\nO, wel traag en wel dom ben ik geweest,\nReeds veel vroeger had ik zonder omwegen mijn weg recht\n  op U toe moeten nemen,\nWat ik tot nu heb gezegd was gebabbel omdat ik 't niet tot\n  U zei; wat ik tot dusver heb gezongen was het lied der\n  zotheid, omdat ik U niet bezong.\n\nNu wil ik alles wegwerpen en tot U komen en de hymnen\n  zingen van U,\nNiemand heeft U ooit begrepen, maar ik begrijp U,\nNiemand heeft U ooit recht laten wedervaren, ook gij deedt\n  U zelf onrecht,\nNiemand, of hij zag gebreken in U, ik alleen vind in U geen\n  gebrek,\nNiemand, of hij wilde èèn boven U stellen, _ik_ ben de man,\n  die nimmer zal toestaan, dat er èèn boven U worde gesteld,\nIk ben de eenige, die noch heer, meester, betere, noch zelfs\n  God, hooger stel dan wat in U leeft.\nSchilders hebben zwevende engelen geschilderd en in hun\n  midden het godsbeeld,\nEn om het hoofd van het godsbeeld deden zij een nimbus\n  stralen van goudzonnig licht.\nMaar ik schilder myriaden hoofden en schilder geen hoofd\n  zonder dien nimbus van goud-zonnig licht,\nUit mijn vingertoppen, uit het brein van iederen man en\n  vrouw stroomt dat licht voor eeuwig zijn stralen uit.\n\nO, ik zou zulke verheven roemzangen van U kunnen zingen!\nGij kendet U-zelf niet, heel U leven hebt gij in U-zelf\n  liggen slapen,\nUw oogen zijn heel Uw leven zoo goed als gesloten geweest,\nAl uw daden komen reeds nu tot U terug en zij bespotten U,\n(Uw streven, weten, bidden, indien zij niet terugkomen om\n  U te bespotten, hoe zullen zij dan tot U terug komen?)\n\nDie spot geldt niet Uw ware leven,\nAchter dien spot en er doorheen zie ik Uw ziel onbevredigd\n  staren,\nIk volg U in Uw geheimste schuilhoeken, waar nog nooit\n  iemand U volgde,\nIndien Uw zwijgen, Uw voorovergebogen zitten aan Uw lessenaar,\n  Uw onverschillig doen, de nacht, het wijde kleed\n  der gewoonte U verhullen voor anderen, zij verhullen U\n  niet voor mij,\nIndien Uw glad geschoren gelaat, Uw dwalend oog, Uw\n  puistig voorhoofd anderen afstooten, mij doen zij dat niet,\nUw bemorst kleed, lichaamseuvel, dronkenschap, gulzigheid,\n  of vroegtijdige onmatigheidsdood, dat alles wordt door\n  mij ter zijde geschoven.\n\nDaar wordt geen talent of gave in eenigen man of vrouw\n  gevonden, of in U kan gelijkwaardigs gevonden worden.\nDaar is geen deugd, geen schoonheid in eenigen man of\n  vrouw, of het even goede is in U,\nDaar is geen zaligheid bereid voor anderen, of gelijke zaligheid\n  wacht U,\n\nWat mij betreft: ik zal niemand beschenken, tenzij ik volkomen\n  hetzelfde U schenken kan,\nNiet eerder zal ik Gods of iemand glorie zingen dan ik Uw\n  glorie zing.\nWie gij ook zijt! Gij hebt recht aanspraak te maken op alles!\nDe heerlijke landen van Oost en West zijn erbarmelijk een\n  schouwspel, vergeleken bij U,\nZie deze onmetelijke weiden, deze eindelooze rivieren, gij zijt\n  onmetelijk en eindeloos als zij,\nDeze furiën, elementen, stormen, het geweld der ontketende\n  natuur, weeën van schijnbare ontbinding: gij zijt de man,\n  gij zijt de vrouw die hen kan bedwingen,\nIn Uw eigen recht zijt gij gebieder over de natuur, de elementen,\n  pijnen, passiën, ontbinding.\n\nUw kluisters vallen van Uw enkels, er is in U een nooit\n  falend vermogen,\nOud of jong, man of vrouw, ongeschoold en laag, door anderen\n  uitgebannen, wat er in U is openbaart zich,\nDoor geboorte, leven, dood, aardlegging heen zijn Uw wegen\n  gebaand en niets is veronachtzaamd,\nDoor bittere ervaring, verlies, eerzucht, onwetendheid, verdriet\n  heen, volgt wat in U is zijn weg.\n\n\n\n\nTERWIJL IK WEGDREEF MET DE EB VAN 'S LEVENS OCEAAN\n\n\n1.\n\nTerwijl ik wegdreef met de eb van 's levens Oceaan,\nTerwijl ik terug ging langs de kust, die ik zoo goed ken,\nTerwijl ik wandelde in Uw vochtig rimpel-zand, Paumanok,\n  door de golven bespoeld,\nWaar het sissend en dreigend geruisch der baren wordt\n  gehoord,\nWaar de woeste oude moeder eindeloos krijt om haar verloren\n  telgen,\nIk, op den laten herfstdag, ging peinzend, zuidwaarts\n  starende,\nDoor mijn electrische Ikheid-zelve vervreemd van den hoogmoed,\n  die mij mijn poëmen doet zeggen,\nIk ging, en was vervuld van den geest, die onder mijn\n  voeten in het zand zijn lijnen had getrokken,\nIk dacht aan het bezinksel op den bodem van alles, ook\n  op den bodem van alle zee, alle land, alle leven der\n  wereld.\n\nMijn aandacht geboeid, mijn oogen afgedwaald van het zuiden,\n  aangetrokken door die rimpels in het zand, volgden\n  het spoor der ebbegolven,\nKaf, stroo, houtsplinters, zeegras en kwallen,\nSchuim, schilvers van glimmende rotsen, zeegras, dit alles\n  had de vloed achtergelaten op het strand,\nMijlen ver wandelde ik, steeds met het geruisch der brekende\n  golven naast mij,\nDaar op Paumanok's kust, en in mij de oude gedachte, dat\n  alles buiten mij wordt weerspiegeld door alles in mijn\n  binnenste,\nDie gedachte kwam door U opnieuw in mij op, gij vischvormig\n  eiland,\nTerwijl ik terugging langs de kust, die ik zoo goed ken,\nTerwijl mijn electrische Ik-heid mij deed zoeken naar mijn\n  evenbeeld.\n\n\n2.\n\nTerwijl ik de kusten van het onbekende zoek,\nTerwijl ik luister naar het lijklied, de stemmen van mannen\n  en vrouwen, die schipbreuk leden,\nTerwijl ik de invloeden adem, die als windstroomen op mij\n  instormen,\nTerwijl de geheimzinnige Oceaan dichter en dichter op mij\n  aanvloeit,\nKomt de gedachte in mij, dat ook ik ten hoogste een nietig\n  aanspoelsel ben van d'Oceaan,\nEen handvol zand en doode zeegrassen, die men kan oprapen,\nDie wòrden opgeraapt, of misschien wel straks weêr worden\n  weggespoeld.\n\nO, teleurgesteld, vernietigd, het hoofd op de borst, de oogen\n  zoekende diep in de aarde,\nGedrukt door het weten, dat ik heb dùrven openen mijn\n  mond,\nNu wetende, dat te midden van allen die hun niet uitklappen\n  en mij de holle echo's hunner woorden in het oor\n  blazen, ik zelf nièt het geringste denkbeeld heb gehad\n  van het wat en wie mijner Ik-heid,\nDat uit al mijn verwaten poëemen nu mijn werkelijke Ik-heid\n  opstaat, nog altijd ongezegd, onbegrepen, onverklaard,\n  onbereikt,\nIk zie haar voor mij uit, mij bespottende met spot-beleefde\n  groeten en buigingen,\nMet de galmen van uit de verte gehoord spotgelach, om elk\n  woord dat ik heb geschreven,\nZwijgend wijzen naar deze zangen èèrst, dan naar het zand\n  onder mijn voeten.\nNu wordt het mij duidelijk, dat ik niets in zijn echten zin heb\n  kunnen bevatten, niet het geringste, en dat niemand dit\n  vermag,\nHier, in het gezicht van d'Oceaan, neemt de Natuur de gelegenheid\n  waar om mij neer te vellen tot mijn Niets,\nOmdat ik gewaagd heb ooit den mond te openen om te\n  spreken.\n\n\n3.\n\nGij Oceanen beide, gij en ik, wij dicht bijeen,\nWij murmelen beiden het zelfde droeve lied, en spoelen zand\n  en slib aan, en weten niet waarom,\nGij, ik en allen hebben in onze ziel, gelijk dit zand de dunne\n  kerven van het weggespoelde leven.\nGij, broze kust bedekt met wrakhout,\nGij, visch-vormig eiland, ik aanvaard wat nu aan mijn voeten\n  ligt,\nWat het Uwe is, is het mijne òok, vader.\nPaumanok, ook ik,\nOok ik blies mij op als waterbellen in mijn najagen van\n  hersenschimmen, dobberde op de onmetelijke golven des\n  levens, werd aangespoeld op Uw kusten,\nOok ik ben niet anders dan een op het zand geslingerd wrak,\nOok ik laat mijn splinters op U achter, gij visch-vormig\n  eiland.\nIk werp mij aan Uw borst, vader,\nIk omklem U zoo, dat gij U niet uit mijn omarming kunt\n  losmaken,\nIk houd innig vast, zoolang tot gij mij het antwoord geeft,\n  dat ik begeer.\nKus mij, kus mij, vader,\nBeroer mij met Uw lippen, zooals ik hen beroer, die ik\n  liefheb,\nLaat, terwijl ik U aan mijn borst klem, Uw adem mij het\n  lieflijk geheim influisteren van dat murmelen, waar ik naar\n  smacht.\n\n\n4.\n\nEb, Oceaan des Levens, (de vloed zal terugkomen)\nStaak niet Uw gejammer, woeste moeder oud,\nKrijt eindeloos om Uw verloren telgen, doch vrees niet en\n  verloochen mij niet,\nOok ik ben Uw zoon, ruìsch niet zoo heesch en toornig aan\n  mijn voeten als ik U beroer, of wat gij wegwerpt, verzamel,\nU en allen heb ik teeder lief,\nWat ik verzamel is zoowel voor mij-zelf als voor dien geest,\n  die op ons neerziet waar wij gaan, en mij en wat het mijne\n  is volgt,\nIk en het mijne, ebberimpels in het zand, wat waardelooze\n  wrakhout,\nSneeuwwit schuim, ledige waterbellen,\n(Zie, hoe eindelijk door mijn doode lippen den stervensdroesem\n  wordt uitgeworpen,\nZie, de prismatieke kleuren glinsteren en bewegen,)\nStroohalmen, spoelzand, splinters,\nOp het doodstrand gespoeld uit velerlei Niets van 's levens\n  droefheid en vreugd. Niets altijd Niets, en toch het een in\n  strijd met het ander,\nUit stroomen, kalmten, duisternis en deining,\nUit gepeins en nadenken, altijd Niets, ten hoogste een ademtocht,\n  een traan, een spat waters of modders,\nEn Niets altijd uit ons bodemloos gestreef, dat opgist en\n  wegvloeit,\nNiets, ten hoogste een of twee teedere maar geschonden\n  bloesembladeren dobberende op de golven en lichtelijk aangespoeld,\nNiets! en ook om ònzentwil die snikkende lijkzang der natuur,\nOok voor ons, wat ook onze oorsprong zij, dat geloei der\n  wolkbazuinen,\nWij, als nietswaardig aangespoeld, vanwaar is ons onbekend,\n  en neergeworpen aan Uw voeten,\nGij die daar zit of gaat, aan Uw voeten,\nWie gij ook zijt, ook wij liggen als wrakken aan Uw voeten.\n\n\n\nZEKERHEID\n\n\nIk heb geen zekerheid noodig, ik ben een mensch wiens ziel\n  zijn geheele aandacht vraagt;\nIk twijfel niet of van onder de voeten en naast de handen en\n  het gezicht, die ik van mij ken, zien nu reeds andere gezichten\n  uìt, die ik niet ken, schoone tastbare gezichten,\nIk twijfel niet of de majesteit en schoonheid der wereld zijn\n  verborgen in iedere iota der wereld,\nIk twijfel niet of ik ben oneindig en het Universum is\n  oneindig, vergeefs tracht ik mij voor te stellen hoe oneindig,\nIk twijfel niet of de werelden en hun zonnestelsels snellen\n  met een goddelijk doel zoo harmonisch door het ruim, en\n  dat ik eenmaal in staat zal zijn te doen als zij, en mèèr\n  dan zij,\nIk twijfel niet of het tijdelijke heeft een duur van millioenen\n  jaren,\nIk twijfel niet of het binnenste heeft zijn binnenste en het\n  buitenste zijn buitenste en het oogenlicht heeft een ander\n  oogenlicht en het gehoor heeft een ander gehoor en de\n  stem een andere stem,\nIk twijfel niet of de dood van de jonge mannen, die zoo innig\n  wordt beweend, heeft zijn levensbloei, en de dood van\n  jonge vrouwen en de dood van kindertjes heeft zijn\n  levensbloei,\n(Of denkt gij, dat het leven kan bloeien, en dat de dood, het\n  doel des levens, niet zijn bloei heeft?)\nIk twijfel niet of de wrakken in de zee ('t doet er niet toe\n  welke verschrikkingen zij gezien hebben, 't doet er niet\n  toe wiens vrouw, kind, man, vader, vriend er ook mede is\n  onder gegaan) bloeien dààr, des levens vol,\nIk twijfel niet of wat daar ooit en ergens gebeurt, heeft in\n  den samenhang der dingen zijn levensbloei,\nIk denk niet, dat Leven de bloeitijd is van het Al, van Tijd\n  en Ruimte, maar ik geloof, dat Zalige Dood die bloeitijd is.\n\n\n\n\nEEN STILLE GEDULDIGE SPIN\n\n\nEen stille geduldige spin,\nZag ik, waar zij op een kleinen vooruitspringenden hoek\n  alleen zat,\nEn ik zag, hoe zij, om de ledige groote ruimte rond zich\n  heen te onderzoeken,\nZich spinnende, spinnende, spinnende langzaam liet afzakken\n  aan onzichtbare draden,\nDie zij steeds effende, die zij onvermoeid verlengde.\nEn gij, o mijn ziel, waar zijt gij,\nOmgeven, los, in matelooze oceanen van Ruimte,\nEindeloos peinzend, wagend, spinnend zoekt gij de sferen\n  om U er mee te verbinden,\nTot de tijd, tot de brug, die gij behoeft, zal gelegd zijn, tot\n  het slepende anker vasthoudt,\nTot de herfstdraad, die gij uitlaat, ergens aan vastblijft,\n  o ziel.\n\n\n\n\nAAN EEN, DIE SPOEDIG ZAL STERVEN\n\n\nTe midden van alle anderen richt ik mij tot U: ik heb U iets\n  te zeggen,\nGij zult sterven--Laat anderen U vertellen wat zij willen, ik\n  zoek geen uitvluchten,\nZonder genade zeg ik U de waarheid, want ik heb U lief, en\n  daarom zeg ik, dat geen ontkomen U mogelijk is.\nZachtkens leg ik op U mijn rechterhand, als een liefkoozing\n  voelt gij 't, Ik praat niet met U, ik buig mijn hoofd zoo\n  dicht over het Uwe, dat gij enkel mijn oogen ziet.\nRustig zit ik aan Uw zijde, ik blijf U trouw,\nIk ben U meer dan verpleegster, meer dan verwant of buur,\nIk ontbind U van alles en allen behalve van Uw eigen ziel,\n  Uw eeuwige ziel, Uw echte ik, dat zekerlijk den dood\n  ontkomt,\nHet lijk, dat gij achter zult laten, zal de droesem zijn van\n  het echte goud Uwer ziel.\nNu breekt de zon door de wolken, die gij den dood-zelf\n  waandet,\nFiere gedachten vervullen U, vertrouwen vervult U, gij\n  glimlacht,\nGij vergeet, dat gij ziek zijt, zooals ik vergeet, dat gij\n  ziek zijt,\nGij ziet Uw geneesmiddelen niet meer, gij let niet meer op\n  Uw weenende vrienden, ik zit aan Uw zijde,\nAnderen weer ik van U af, daar valt niet te weeklagen, daar\n  is niemand te beklagen,\nIk beklaag U niet, ik benijd U, want meer dan het geluk, dat\n  wij kennen is U bereid.\n\n\n\n\nGEZICHTEN\n\n\n1.\n\nDrentelende door de straten of rijdende op den rijweg buiten,\n  o wat al gezichten!\nGezichten van vriendschap, stelligheid, borgtocht, lieflijkheid,\n  ideaal,\nHet gezicht van den toekomst-droomer, het overal welkome\n  alledaags-vriendelijke gezicht,\nHet gezicht van een die zingt, de indrukwekkende gezichten\n  van natuurwetkenners, en van rechters met breede jukbeenderen,\nHet gezicht van jagers en visschers met knobbels van opmerkzaamheid\n  boven de wenkbrauwen, de geschoren witte gezichten\n  van vrome burgers,\nDe nobele, ongewone, verlangende, vragende kunstenaarsgezichten,\nHet leelijke gezicht, dat een majesteitelijke ziel soms bedekt,\n  het mooie gezicht van een, die verfoeid of veracht wordt,\nDe heilige gezichten van kleine kinderen, het lichtstralende\n  gezicht van de moeder van vele kinderen,\nHet gezicht van een mignon, het gezicht van vereering,\nHet gezicht vaag als een droom, het gezicht streng als een\n  eeuwig verstijfde rots,\nHet gezicht ontdaan van zijn goed of zijn kwaad, het gezicht\n  van den ontmande,\nEen wilde valk, zijn vleugels door den snoeier gekortwiekt.\nEen hengst, overgegeven aan riemen en mes van den snijder.\nDus, drentelende door de straten of overstekende met de\n  steeds heen en weer varende veerboot, gezichten en gezichten\n  en gezichten,\nIk zie hen, klaag niet, en ben tevreden met allen.\n\n\n2.\n\nDenkt gij, dat ik tevreden ben, zou kunnen zijn, indien ik\n  dacht, dat deze gezichten d'eindvorm des levens waren?\nDit gezicht is te jammerlijk om van een man te kunnen zijn,\nEen verworpen luis, die kruipend soebat om te leven,\nEen witgemuilde made, blij als zij in haar gat mag wegkruipen.\nDit gezicht is een hondensnuit, snuffelend naar afval,\nAdders nestelen in dien muil, ik hoor de sissende bedreiging.\nDit gezicht is mist, kouder dan de Poolzee,\nDe slaperige en waggelende ijsbergen kreunen onder het\n  voortdrijven.\nDit is een gezicht van bittere kruiden, dàt van een laxeermiddel:\n  zij hebben geen etiket noodig,\nEn nog meer van den apotheker: een gezicht van laudanum,\n  caoutchouc, duveltjesdrek,\nDit gezicht is een toeval: de sprakelooze tong uit een onmenschelijken\n  kreet,\nDe aderen aan den nek zwellen op, de oogen rollen tot enkel\n  hun wit wordt gezien,\nDe tanden knarsen, de handpalmen zijn opengereten door de\n  ingedrukte nagels,\nDe man valt strijdende tegen zijn ziekte schuimbekkend\n  neer, terwijl zijn oogen staren.\nDit gezicht is opgevreten van ongedierte en wormen,\nEn dit is het mes van een moordenaar, half uit de schede.\nDit gezicht is den doodgraver zijn vreeselijk loon schuldig,\nEen nooit-stille doodsklok wordt daarin geluid.\n\n\n3.\n\nGelaatstrekken van mijn evennaasten, wildet gij mij misleiden\n  in Uw kronkelenden doodendans?\nO, misleiden kunt gij mij niet!\nIk zie Uw bochtigen nimmer afgebroken stoet,\nIk zie beneden het oppervlak van Uw woeste en lage\n  mommen.\nVertrekt en verdraait Uw gezicht, zooveel gij wilt, tast met\n  het fijne voel-instituut van visschen of ratten,\nEenmaal zult gij zekerlijk Uw ware gezicht moeten toonen.\n\nIk zag het gezicht van den smerigsten, slobberendsten idioot\n  in het gesticht,\nEn ik wist tot mijn troost wat de doctors daar niet wisten,\nIk kende de krachten, die het denken van mijn broeder hadden\n  verlamd en gebroken,\nEn diezelfde krachten zullen eens het vuil voor het vervallen\n  huis opruimen,\nEn ik zal opnieuw uitzien, als wij twee geslachten verder zijn,\nDan zal ik den echten huisheer ontmoeten, volkomen en\n  ongedeerd, elke atoom van hem zoo goed als een van de\n  mijne.\n\n\n4.\n\nDe Heer komt nader en steeds nader,\nOveral strijdende tegen de duisternis, de tragen meevoerende\n  met krachtigen arm.\nUit dit gezicht dagen banieren en ruiterij op--O, heerlijk!\n  Ik zie wat verschijnt,\nIk zie de hooge mutsen van pioniers, ik zie de staven der\n  voorloopers ruim baan maken,\nIk hoor het tromgeroffel der overwinning.\nDit gezicht is een reddingsboot,\nDit is het gebaarde gezicht, dat het bevel geeft, het ontleent\n  gezag aan zich-zelf;\nDit gezicht is een geurige vrucht, rijp om genoten te worden,\nDit gezicht van een gezonden, eerlijken knaap is de belofte\n  van al wat goed is.\nDeze gezichten getuigen of zij slapen of waken,\nZij bewijzen hun afkomst van den Meester zelf.\nHet woord, dat ik sprak, kome in vervulling, niet èèn sluit\n  ik uit--rood, wit, zwart, allen zijn goddelijk,\nIn elk huis is het Ovum, na duizenden jaren zal het bewezen\n  worden.\nVlekken of barsten in de vensters schrikken mij niet af,\nVerheven en volkomen menschen staan daar achter, en wenken\n  mij toe,\nIk hoor de belofte en heb tijd om te wachten.\nDit is het gezicht van een volbloeide lelie,\nZij spreekt tot den hinkenden man dicht aan het tuinhek,\n_Kom hier_, roept zij blozend, _kom heel dicht bij me, hinkende\nman,_\n_Blijf naast mij staan tot ik zoo hoog ik maar kan tegen U kan\naanleunen,_\n_Vervul mij met witten honig, buig U over mij heen,_\n_Beroer mij met Uw baard, beroer mij aan borst en schouders._\n\n\n5.\n\nHet oude gezicht van de moeder van vele kinderen,\nStil! Nu is 't mij zeer liefelijk.\nLaag en laat is de rook op den Eersten-dagmorgen,\nHij hangt vlak boven de boomen-rijen aan de schuttingen,\nHij hangt dun bij de sassafras en de wilde kers, en in de\n  katstruiken omlaag.\nIk zag de rijke dames prachtig gekleed op de soirée,\nIk hoorde wat de zangers zoo lang zongen,\nLeerde wie in karmozijne jeugd opkwam uit het witte schuim\n  en het waterblauw.\nZie een vrouw!\nHaar gezicht komt half uit haar kwaker-muts, haar gezicht\n  is reiner en schooner dan de hemel.\nZij zit in een armstoel onder de beschaduwde deur van de\n  boerderij,\nDe zon streelt haar oude witte hoofd,\nHaar ruim gewaad is van roomkleurig linnen,\nHaar kleinzonen teelden het vlas en haar kleindochters\n  sponnen 't met het rokken en het wiel.\nHet melodieuze karakter der aarde,\nHet einde waar voorbij het denken niet kan gaan, en ook niet\n  wenscht te gaan,\nDe gerechtvaardigde moeder der menschen.\n\n\n\n\nLIED VAN ZONSONDERGANG\n\n\nPracht van den vallenden dag, die mij verheft en vervult,\nUur van profetische kracht, uur dat het verleden doet herleven,\nHet leven stijgt op in mijn keel, U, goddelijke middenmensch,\nU, aarde en leven, zal ik bezingen tot den laatsten zonnegloor.\n\nOpen mond mijner ziel, die blijheid uit,\nOogen mijner ziel, die volmaaktheid zien,\nMijn grashalmen, die de dingen des levens trouwelijk roemen,\nEn de triumf der dingen des levens bevestigen.\n\nSchoon iedereen!\nSchoon, wat wij Ruimte noemen, sfeer van ongetelde geesten,\nSchoon het voortbrengings-mysterie van het Zijn zelfs in het\n  onnaspeurlijke insect,\nSchoon het vermogen der spraak, de zinnen, het lijf,\nSchoon het verdwijnende licht, schoon de bleeke weerglans\n  der nieuwe maan aan den Westerhemel,\nSchoon wat ik ook zie of hoor of voel tot het einde.\n\nGrootheid, in alles,\nIn de voldoening en de zekerheid der dieren,\nIn den jaarlijkschen terugkeer der seizoenen,\nIn de vreugden der jonkheid,\nIn de kracht en den bloei des mannelijken levens,\nIn de grandeur en de uitgelezenheid van den ouderdom,\nIn het heerlijke uitzien op den Dood.\nWonderbaarlijk, het heengaan!\nWonderbaarlijk, het leven!\nHet hart, de drijfkracht van 't overal-gelijke en onschuldige\n  bloed!\nHoe liefelijk, de lucht te ademen!\nTe spreken--te gaan--iets met de hand aan te vatten!\nZich voor te bereiden op den slaap, op het naar bed gaan,\n  neer te zien op mijn rooskleurig lijf!\nBewustzijn te bezitten van dit lijf, zoo voldaan, zoo grootsch!\nDeze ongelooflijke God te zijn, die ik ben!\nTe hebben gewandeld onder andere Goden, deze mannen\n  en vrouwen, die ik liefheb.\nWonderbaarlijk, hoe ik U en mij-zelf roem!\nHoe mijn gedachten zachtkens spelen over de dingen, die ik\n  zie om mij heen!\nHoe de aarde op haar baan voort en voort schiet! Hoe de\n  zon, maan, sterren voort en voort schieten op hun baan!\nHoe het water wegsnelt en zingt! (Daar is leven overal en in\n  alles!)\nHoe de boomen oprijzen en opstaan met sterke stammen, met\n  takken en bladeren!\n(Daar is meer dan wij zien in elk dier boomen, daar is een\n  levende ziel!)\nO wonder van alle dingen--wonder van het kleinste atoom\n  zelfs!\nO spiritualiteit der dingen!\nO levensaccoord, dat lieflijk vloeit door menschengeslachten,\n  en nu mij en Amerika bezielt!\nIk voel Uw sterke trilling, doe haar uit mij vloeien, en blijde\n  van mij uitgaan in anderen.\nIk ook bezing de zon, in opkomst of ter noen, of, gelijk nu, in\n  haar ondergaan,\nIk ook weerklop het brein en de schoonheid der aarde, en\n  van heel het leven der aarde,\nIk heb ook den onweerstaanbaren drang gevoeld van mijn\n  Ik-heid.\n\nToen ik den Missisippi afdreef,\nToen mijn gang ging over de prairiën,\nToen ik volop leefde, toen ik uitkeek door mijn vensters,\n  deze oogen,\nToen ik uitging in den morgen, toen ik het licht in het\n  Oosten zag doorbreken,\nToen ik baadde aan het strand der Oosterzee en dan weer\n  aan het strand der Westerzee,\nToen ik zwierf in de straten van Chicago, diep-in-'t-land, of\n  waar ik ook omzwierf in de straten,\nOf steden, of zwijgende wouden, of zelfs midden in het\n  schouwspel van oorlog,\nWaar ik ook was, steeds heb ik mij vervuld van tevredenheid\n  en overwinning.\n\nTot het einde bezing ik het twee-een-zijn, nieuw of oud,\nIk bezing het eindeloos einde der dingen,\nIk zeg de natuur blijft, licht blijft,\nWat ik bezing, bezing ik met bezielende stem,\nWant niet één onvolmaaktheid zie ik in gansch het Heelal,\nEn ik zie aan het Einde niet eenig ding, niet eenige uitkomst,\n  die treuren doet in het Heelal.\n\nO, ondergaande zon! hoewel Uw tijd is gekomen,\nBlijf ik voortgaan onder U te zingen, en zoo anderen niet, ik\n  zing in onverzwakte aanbidding voor U!\n\n\n\n\nTOT WEERZIENS!\n\n\nOm te besluiten kondig ik aan wat na mij komt.\nIk herinner U, dat ik, voor dit boek tot leven kwam, heb\n  gezegd,\nIk zou mijn stem blijde en krachtig doen getuigen, dat er\n  volmaaktheid is in alles.\nWanneer Amerika volbrengt wat beloofd is,\nWanneer door deze Staten honderd-millioen voortreffelijke\n  menschen gaan,\nWanneer de overigen voor hen ter zijde gaan en voor hen\n  leven,\nWanneer de kinderen van de volmaakte moeders bewijzen\n  wat Amerika is,\nDan komt voor mij en het mijne d'echte blijdschap.\n\nIk ben doorgedrongen sterk in mijn eigen recht,\nIk heb lijf en ziel, vrede en oorlog bezongen, en de zangen\n  van leven en dood doen hooren,\nEn de zangen van geboorte, en laten zien dat daar vele geboorten\n  zijn.\nIk heb mijn leer opengelegd voor ieder, met vasten tred ben\n  ik het leven doorgegaan;\nTerwijl mijn levensvreugde nu volmaakt is, fluister ik: _Tot\n  weerziens!_\nEn neem de hand van de jonge vrouw en de hand van den\n  jongen man voor den laatsten keer.\n\nIk verkondig de opkomst van natuurlijke menschen,\nIk verkondig de triomfantelijke rechtvaardigheid,\nIk verkondig ongedeerde vrijheid en gelijkheid,\nIk verkondig de rechtvaardiging van oprechtheid en de\n  rechtvaardiging van zelfbewustheid,\nIk verkondig, dat de identiteit dezer Staten een enkele\n  identiteit is,\nIk verkondig, dat de Unie steeds vaster en onverbrekelijker\n  wordt,\nIk verkondig zooveel heerlijkheid en zooveel Majesteit, dat\n  al wat daar voorheen schoon was op aarde er bij verbleekt.\n\nIk verkondig verknochtheid, ik zeg: zij zal eindeloos en onoplosbaar\n  zijn,\nIk zeg: gij zult den vriend vinden naar wien gij gezocht hebt.\n\nIk verkondig de komst van een man of een vrouw, misschien\n  zijt gij dat _(Tot ziens dan!)_\nIk verkondig den grooten Mensch, vloeizaam als de Natuur,\n  kuisch, liefdevol, deelnemend, welgewapend.\n\nIk verkondig een leven, dat overvloedig, vurig, goddelijk,\n  stoutmoedig zal zijn,\nIk verkondig het Einde, dat lichtvol en blijde zich zal passen\n  aan den overgang.\n\nIk verkondig myriaden van jeugd, schoonheid, kracht en\n  lieflijk bloed,\nIk verkondig een geslacht van heerlijke en wijze grijsheid.\n\nO geweldiger en heviger--_(Tot ziens!)_\nO myriaden, die te dicht mij omgeeft,\nIk voorzie te veel, ik zie de goddelijke toekomst helderder\n  dan ooit te voren,\nDit is, geloof ik, de helderziendheid van het sterven.\n\nSpoed U dan, o stem, klink op voor 't laatst,\nGroet, groet nog eens het licht, galm nog eens den ouden\n  kreet uit.\n\nBezield schalt mijn roep, het luchtruim is mijn,\nIk zie om mij heen vrijelijk, neem wat ik zie in mij op,\nSnel voorwaarts, maar nu een wijl afgestegen,\nVreemd klinkend nieuws breng ik,\nGloeiende vonken, hemelsche zaden werp ik neer in den\n  droesem,\nIk zelf, onkundig, vervul mijn opdracht, en verlies nooit den\n  moed van het Waarom?\nEn den groei en den bloei van het zaad laat ik over aan\n  geslacht na geslacht,\nAan troepen, die in den strijd-zelf opkomen, zij zullen de\n  taak, die ik opgelegd heb, volbrengen,\nAan vrouwen vermaak ik enkele fluisteringen van mijn Ikheid,\n  haar liefde verklaar ik mij duidelijker,\nAan jonge mannen geef ik de vragen des levens--geen\n  zwetser, ik--en beproef de kracht van hun brein,\nZoo ga ik voort, korten tijd sprekende, zichtbaar, vol tegenstrijdigheid,\nHierna een welluidende echo, waar gretig naar zal geluisterd\n  worden (sterven maakt mij waarlijk onsterflijk)\nHet beste van mijn leven, wanneer ik niet langer zichtbaar\n  zal zijn, en waartoe ik mij onophoudelijk heb voorbereid.\n\nWat dan nog meer, dat ik draal en wijl en voortkruip met\n  ongesloten mond?\nIs er wel eenig beslissend vaarwel?\n\nMijn zangen zijn hiermee geëindigd, ik laat hen na,\nVan achter het scherm, dat mij verborgen hield, kom ik nu\n  naar voren, en ga regelrecht op U toe.\n\nCamerado, dit is geen boek,\nWie het aanraakt, raakt een mensch aan,\n(Is 't nacht?

BEAT! DRUMS!\n\n\n    Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!\n    Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless force,\n    Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,\n    Into the school where the scholar is studying;\n    Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with his\n          bride,\n    Not the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his\n          grain,\n    So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.\n\n    Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!\n    Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;\n    Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must\n          sleep in those beds,\n    No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would they\n          continue?\n    Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?\n    Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?\n    Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.\n\n    Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!\n    Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,\n    Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,\n    Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,\n    Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,\n    Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the\n          hearses,\n    So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.\n\n\n\n\nCITY OF SHIPS\n\n\n    City of ships!\n    (O the black ships! O the fierce ships!\n    O the beautiful sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)\n    City of the world! (for all races are here,\n    All the lands of the earth make contributions here);\n    City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!\n    City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and\n          out with eddies and foam!\n    City of wharves and stores--city of tall facades of marble and iron!\n    Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!\n    Spring up O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!\n    Fear not--submit to no models but your own, O city!\n    Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!\n\n    I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted I have\n          adopted,\n    Good or bad I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn\n          anything,\n    I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more,\n    In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,\n    War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!\n\n\n\n\nA MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN\n\n\n    A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,\n    A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,\n    Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,\n    Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted\n          building,\n    We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted\n          building,\n    'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu\n          hospital,\n    Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and\n          poems ever made,\n    Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and\n          lamps,\n    And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and\n          clouds of smoke,\n    By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some\n          in the pews laid down,\n    At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of\n          bleeding to death (he is shot in the abdomen),\n    I stanch the blood temporarily (the youngster's face is white as a\n          lily),\n    Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb\n          it all,\n    Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,\n          some of them dead,\n    Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the\n          odour of blood,\n    The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also\n           fill'd,\n    Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\n          death-spasm sweating,\n    An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,\n    The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the\n          torches,\n    These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odour,\n    Then hear outside the orders given, _Fall in, my men, fall in_;\n    But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives\n          he me,\n    Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\n    Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\n    The unknown road still marching.\n\n\n\n\nCOME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER\n\n\n    Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,\n    And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.\n\n    Lo, 'tis autumn,\n    Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,\n    Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate\n          wind,\n    Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd\n          vines\n    (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?\n    Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?),\n    Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with\n          wondrous clouds,\n    Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers\n          well.\n\n    Down in the fields all prospers well,\n    But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,\n    And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.\n\n    Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,\n    She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.\n\n    Open the envelope quickly,\n    O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,\n    O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!\n    All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main\n          words only,\n    Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken\n          to hospital,\n    At present low, but will soon be better._\n\n    Ah now the single figure to me,\n    Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\n    Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\n    By the jamb of a door leans.\n\n    _Grieve not so, dear mother_ (the just-grown daughter speaks through\n          her sobs,\n    The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd),\n    _See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._\n\n    Alas poor boy, he will never be better (nor may be needs to be\n          better, that brave and simple soul),\n    While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,\n    The only son is dead.\n\n    But the mother needs to be better,\n    She with thin form presently drest in black,\n    By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often\n          waking,\n    In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,\n    O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and\n          withdraw,\n    To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.\n\n\n\n\nA TWILIGHT SONG\n\n\n    As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame,\n    Musing on long-pass'd war-scenes--of the countless buried unknown\n          soldiers,\n    Of the vacant names, as unindented air's and sea's--the unreturn'd,\n    The brief truce after battle, with grim burial-squads, and the\n          deep-fill'd trenches\n    Of gather'd dead from all America, North, South, East, West, whence\n          they came up,\n    From wooded Maine, New-England's farms, from fertile Pennsylvania,\n          Illinois, Ohio,\n    From the measureless West, Virginia, the South, the Carolinas, Texas\n    (Even here in my room-shadows and half-lights in the noiseless\n          flickering flames,\n    Again I see the stalwart ranks on-filing, rising--I hear the rhythmic\n          tramp of the armies);\n    You million unwrit names all, all--you dark bequest from all the war,\n    A special verse for you--a flash of duty long neglected--your mystic\n          roll strangely gather'd here,\n    Each name recall'd by me from out the darkness and death's ashes,\n    Henceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for many a\n          future year,\n    Your mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or South,\n    Embalm'd with love in this twilight song.\n\n\n\n\nA SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM\n\n\n    A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,\n    As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,\n    As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital\n         tent,\n    Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended\n          lying,\n    Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,\n    Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.\n\n    Curious I halt and silent stand,\n    Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first\n          just lift the blanket;\n    Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,\n          and flesh all sunken about the eyes?\n    Who are you my dear comrade?\n\n    Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?\n    Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?\n\n    Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of beautiful\n          yellow-white ivory;\n    Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the\n          Christ himself,\n    Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.\n\n\n\n\nYEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME\n\n\n    Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!\n    Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,\n    A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,\n    Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,\n    Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled,\n    And sullen hymns of defeat?\n\n\n\n\nFIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE\n\n\n    First O songs for a prelude,\n    Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,\n    How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,\n    How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,\n    (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless.\n    O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)\n    How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with\n          indifferent hand,\n    How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in\n          their stead,\n    How you led to the war (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of\n          soldiers),\n    How Manhattan drum-taps led.\n\n    Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,\n    Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and\n          turbulent city,\n    Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,\n    With her million children around her, suddenly,\n    At dead of night, at news from the south,\n    Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.\n\n    A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,\n    Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.\n    From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,\n    Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.\n\n    To the drum-taps prompt,\n    The young men falling in and arming,\n    The mechanics arming (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's\n          hammer, tost aside with precipitation),\n    The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,\n    The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing\n          the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,\n    The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all\n          leaving;\n    Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,\n    The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their\n          accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,\n    Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,\n    The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the\n          sunrise cannon and again at sunset,\n    Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark\n          from the wharves\n    (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their\n          guns on their shoulders!\n    How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and their\n          clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)\n    The blood of the city up--arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,\n    The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the\n          public buildings and stores,\n    The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his\n          mother\n    (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain\n          him),\n    The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing\n          the way,\n    The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their\n          favourites,\n    The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble\n          lightly over the stones\n    (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,\n    Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business);\n    All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,\n    The hospital service, the lint, bandages, and medicines,\n    The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no\n          mere parade now;\n    War! an arm'd race is advancing, the welcome for battle, no turning\n          away;\n    War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to\n          welcome it.\n\n    Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!\n    It's O for a manly life in the camp.\n\n    And the sturdy artillery\n    The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,\n    Unlimber them! (No more as the past forty years for salutes for\n          courtesies merely,\n    Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)\n\n    And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,\n    Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,\n    Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid all\n          your children,\n    But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.\n\n\n\n\nSONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK\n\n\n    _Poet_\n\n    O a new song, a free song,\n    Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,\n    By the wind's voice and that of the drum,\n    By the banner's voice and the child's voice and sea's voice and\n         father's voice,\n    Low on the ground and high in the air,\n    On the ground where father and child stand,\n    In the upward air where their eyes turn,\n    Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.\n\n    Words! book-words! what are you?\n    Words no more, for hearken and see,\n    My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,\n    With the banner and pennant a-flapping.\n\n    I'll weave the chord and twine in,\n    Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,\n    I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs whizz\n    (As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,\n    Crying with trumpet voice, _Arouse and beware!

masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the\n          masks\n    (As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,\n          whoever you are),\n    How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,\n          and to you!\n    I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,\n    O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,\n    Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;\n    The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,\n    Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,\n    Nor the bayonet stab O

 Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts (yet onward ever unfaltering\n          pressing),\n    Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,\n    That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tireless\n          phantom flitted,\n    Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the\n          drum,\n    Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,\n          reverberates round me,\n    As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,\n    As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,\n    As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,\n    As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the\n          distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,\n    Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,\n    Evenly, lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;\n    Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death\n          next day,\n    Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,\n    Leave me your pulses of rage--bequeath them to me--fill me with\n          currents convulsive,\n    Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,\n    Let them identify you to the future in these songs.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RETURN OF THE HEROES\n\n\n    1\n\n    For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,\n    Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,\n    Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,\n    Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,\n    Tuning a verse for thee.\n\n    O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,\n    O harvest of my lands--O boundless summer growths,\n    O lavish brown parturient earth--O infinite teeming womb,\n    A song to narrate thee.\n\n\n    2\n\n    Ever upon this stage,\n    Is acted God's calm annual drama,\n    Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,\n    Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,\n    The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,\n    The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,\n    The liliput countless armies of the grass,\n    The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,\n    The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,\n    The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the\n          silvery fringes,\n    The high-dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,\n    The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,\n    The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.\n\n\n    3\n\n    Fecund America--to-day,\n    Thou art all over set in births and joys!\n    Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing\n          garment,\n    Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,\n    A myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast\n          demesne,\n    As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into port,\n    As rain falls from the heaven and vapours rise from the earth, so\n          have the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of\n          thee;\n    Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!\n    Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,\n    Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,\n    Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon thy\n          world, and lookest East and lookest West,\n    Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million\n          farms, and missest nothing,\n    Thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable (thou only art hospitable as\n          God is hospitable).\n\n\n    4\n\n    When late I sang sad was my voice,\n    Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and\n          smoke of war;\n    In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,\n    Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.\n\n    But now I sing not war,\n    Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,\n    Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;\n    No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.\n\n    Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping\n          armies?\n    Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow'd.\n\n    (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,\n    With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your\n          muskets;\n    How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd.\n\n    Pass--then rattle drums again,\n    For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,\n    Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,\n    O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your\n          fever,\n    O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and the\n        crutch,\n    Lo, your pallid army follows.)\n\n\n    5\n\n    But on these days of brightness,\n    On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the\n          high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,\n    Should the dead intrude?\n\n    Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,\n    They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,\n    And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.\n\n    Nor do I forget you Departed,\n    Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,\n    But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace, like\n          pleasing phantoms,\n    Your memories rising glide silently by me.\n\n\n    6\n\n    I saw the day the return of the heroes,\n    (Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,\n    Them that day I saw not).\n\n    I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,\n    I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,\n    Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of\n          mighty camps.\n\n    No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,\n    Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,\n    Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,\n    Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.\n\n    A pause--the armies wait,\n    A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,\n    The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,\n    They melt, they disappear.\n\n    Exult O lands! victorious lands!\n    Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,\n    But here and hence your victory.\n\n    Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,\n    Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,\n    Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,\n    With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars.\n\n\n    7\n\n    Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!\n    The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,\n    The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.\n\n    All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,\n    I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,\n    Man's innocent and strong arenas.\n\n    I see the heroes at other toils,\n    I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.\n\n    I see where the Mother of All,\n    With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,\n    And counts the varied gathering of the products.\n\n    Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,\n    Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,\n    Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,\n    Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,\n    Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,\n    And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,\n    And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,\n    And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring\n          grass.\n\n    Toil on heroes! harvest the products!\n    Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,\n    With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.\n\n    Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!\n    The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.\n\n    Well-pleased America thou beholdest,\n    Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,\n    The human-divine inventions, the labour-saving implements;\n    Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving\n          hay-rakes,\n    The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines,\n    The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well\n          separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,\n    Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the\n          rice-cleanser.\n\n    Beneath thy look O Maternal,\n    With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.\n\n    All gather and all harvest,\n    Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in\n          security,\n    Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.\n\n    Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great\n          face only,\n    Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear\n          under thee,\n    Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its\n          light-green sheath,\n    Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,\n    Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to\n          theirs;\n    Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the\n          golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,\n    Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,\n    Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,\n    Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches of\n          grapes from the vines,\n    Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,\n    Under the beaming sun and under thee.\n\n\n\n\nMEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN\n\nWHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D\n\n\n    1\n\n    When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,\n    And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,\n    I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.\n\n    Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,\n    Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,\n    And thought of him I love.\n\n\n    2\n\n    O powerful western fallen star!\n    O shades of night--O moody, tearful night!\n    O great star disappear'd--O the black murk that hides the star!\n    O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of me!\n    O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.\n\n\n    3\n\n    In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd\n          palings,\n    Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich\n          green,\n    With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I\n          love,\n    With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the door-yard,\n    With delicate-colour'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,\n    A sprig with its flower I break.\n\n\n    4\n\n    In the swamp in secluded recesses,\n    A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.\n\n    Solitary the thrush,\n    The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\n    Sings by himself a song.\n\n    Song of the bleeding throat,\n    Death's outlet song of life (for well dear brother I know,\n    If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die).\n\n\n    5\n\n    Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,\n    Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd\n          from the ground, spotting the gray debris,\n    Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the\n          endless grass,\n    Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the\n          dark-brown fields uprisen,\n    Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,\n    Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,\n    Night and day journeys a coffin.\n\n\n    6\n\n    Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,\n    Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,\n    With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,\n    With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women\n          standing,\n    With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,\n    With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the\n          unbared heads,\n    With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,\n    With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising\n          strong and solemn,\n    With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,\n    The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these you\n          journey,\n    With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,\n    Here, coffin that slowly passes,\n    I give you my sprig of lilac.\n\n\n    7\n\n    (Nor for you, for one alone,\n    Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,\n    For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and\n          sacred death.\n\n    All over bouquets of roses,\n    O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,\n    But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,\n    Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,\n    With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,\n    For you and the coffins all of you O death.)\n\n\n    8\n\n    O western orb sailing the heaven,\n    Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd,\n    As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,\n    As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,\n    As you dropp'd from the sky low down as if to my side (while the other\n          stars all look'd on),\n    As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something I know not what\n          kept me from sleep),\n    As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you\n          were of woe,\n    As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent\n          night,\n    As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black\n          of the night,\n    As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,\n    Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.\n\n\n    9\n\n    Sing on there in the swamp,\n    O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,\n    I hear, I come presently, I understand you,\n    But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,\n    The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.\n\n\n    10\n\n    O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?\n    And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?\n    And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?\n\n    Sea-winds blown from east and west,\n    Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till\n          there on the prairies meeting,\n    These and with these and the breath of my chant,\n    I'll perfume the grave of him I love.\n\n\n    11\n\n    O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?\n    And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,\n    To adorn the burial-house of him I love?\n\n    Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,\n    With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and\n          bright,\n    With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun,\n          burning, expanding the air,\n    With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves\n          of the trees prolific,\n    In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a\n          wind-dapple here and there,\n    With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and\n          shadows,\n    And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,\n    And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward\n          returning.\n\n\n    12\n\n    Lo, body and soul--this land,\n    My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,\n          and the ships,\n    The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio's\n          shores and flashing Missouri,\n    And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.\n\n    Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,\n    The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,\n    The gentle soft-born measureless light,\n    The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,\n    The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,\n    Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.\n\n\n    13\n\n    Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,\n    Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,\n    Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.\n\n    Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,\n    Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.\n\n    O liquid and free and tender!\n    O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!\n    You only I hear--yet the star holds me (but will soon depart),\n    Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me.\n\n\n    14\n\n    Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,\n    In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and\n          the farmers preparing their crops,\n    In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,\n    In the heavenly aerial beauty (after the perturb'd winds and the\n          storms),\n    Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the\n          voices of children and women,\n    The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,\n    And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with\n          labour,\n    And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with\n          its meals and minutia of daily usages,\n    And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--lo,\n          then and there,\n    Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\n    Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,\n    And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\n\n    Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\n    And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\n    And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of\n          companions,\n    I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\n    Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\n    To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\n\n    And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,\n    The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,\n    And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\n\n    From deep secluded recesses,\n    From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\n    Came the carol of the bird.\n\n    And the charm of the carol rapt me,\n    As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\n    And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\n\n    _Come lovely and soothing death,\n    Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\n    In the day, in the night, to all, to each,\n    Sooner or later delicate death._\n\n    _Prais'd be the fathomless universe,\n    For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\n    And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!\n    For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death._\n\n    _Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\n    Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\n    Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\n    I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come\n         unfalteringly._\n\n    _Approach strong deliveress,\n    When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\n    Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\n    Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death._\n\n    _From me to thee glad serenades,\n    Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings\n          for thee,\n    And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are\n          fitting,\n    And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night._\n\n    _The night in silence under many a star,\n    The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\n    And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,\n    And the body gratefully nestling close to thee._\n\n    _Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,\n    Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the\n          prairies wide,\n    Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\n    I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death._\n\n\n    15\n\n    To the tally of my soul,\n    Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\n    With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\n\n    Loud in the pines and cedars dim,\n    Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\n    And I with my comrades there in the night.\n\n    While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\n    As to long panoramas of visions.\n\n    And I saw askant the armies,\n    I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\n    Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw\n          them,\n    And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\n    And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),\n    And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.\n\n    I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\n    And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\n    I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\n    But I saw they were not as was thought,\n    They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,\n    The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,\n    And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,\n    And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.\n\n\n    16\n\n    Passing the visions, passing the night,\n    Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,\n    Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\n    Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\n    As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,\n          flooding the night,\n    Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again\n          bursting with joy,\n    Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\n    As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\n    Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\n    I leave thee there in the dooryard, blooming, returning with spring.\n\n    I cease from my song for thee,\n    From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with\n          thee,\n    O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\n\n    Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\n    The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\n    And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,\n    With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\n    With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\n    Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for\n          the dead I loved so well,\n    For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for\n          his dear sake,\n    Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\n    There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.\n\n\n\n\nO CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!\n\n\n    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,\n    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,\n    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\n    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\n          But O heart! heart! heart!\n            O the bleeding drops of red,\n              Where on the deck my Captain lies,\n                Fallen cold and dead.\n\n    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\n    Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,\n    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,\n    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\n          Here Captain! dear father!\n            This arm beneath your head!\n              It is some dream that on the deck,\n                You've fallen cold and dead.\n\n    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,\n    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,\n    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,\n    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;\n          Exult O shores, and ring O bells!\n            But I with mournful tread,\n              Walk the deck my Captain lies,\n                Fallen cold and dead.\n\n\n\n\nHUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO-DAY\n\n(_May 4, 1865_)\n\n\n    Hush'd be the camps to-day,\n    And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,\n    And each with musing soul retire to celebrate,\n    Our dear commander's death.\n\n    No more for him life's stormy conflicts,\n    Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,\n    Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.\n\n    But sing poet in our name,\n    Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it\n          truly.\n\n    As they invault the coffin there,\n    Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,\n    For the heavy hearts of soldiers.\n\n\n\n\nASHES OF SOLDIERS\n\n\n    Ashes of soldiers South or North,\n    As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,\n    The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,\n    And again the advance of the armies.\n\n    Noiseless as mists and vapours,\n    From their graves in the trenches ascending,\n    From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,\n    From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,\n    In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or\n          single ones they come,\n    And silently gather round me.\n\n    Now sound no note O trumpeters,\n    Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,\n    With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs (ah\n          my brave horsemen!\n    My handsome tan-faced horsemen!

Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,\n    Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,\n    Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of\n          elected persons,\n    Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of\n          death pours its sweeping and unript waves,\n    Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside\n          authority,\n    Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President, Mayor,\n          Governor and what not, are agents for pay,\n    Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on\n          themselves,\n    Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,\n    Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,\n    Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as\n          the men,\n    Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the\n          men;\n    Where the city of the faithfulest

And leans on a ponderous axe.\n\n    (Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?\n    Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)\n\n    I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,\n    I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,\n    Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers, rejected\n          kings,\n    Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.\n\n    I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,\n    The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out\n    (Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out).\n\n    I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,\n    Both blade and helve are clean,\n    They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp no more the\n          necks of queens.\n\n    I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,\n    I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any axe\n          upon it,\n    I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race, the\n          newest, largest race.\n\n\n    9\n\n    (America!

is.\n\n\n    12\n\n    The main shapes arise!\n    Shapes of Democracy total, result of centuries,\n    Shapes ever projecting other shapes,\n    Shapes of turbulent manly cities,\n    Shapes of the

and\n          aquatic plants,\n    Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing\n          the crow with its bill, for amusement--and I triumphantly\n          twittering,\n    The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh\n          themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside\n          move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to\n          time reliev'd by other sentinels--and I feeding and taking\n          turns with the rest,\n    In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,\n          rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his\n          fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--and I, plunging at\n          the hunters, corner'd and desperate,\n    In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the\n          countless workmen working in the shops,\n    And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself\n          than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,\n    Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more\n          inevitable united, part to part, and made out of a thousand\n          diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands are\n          inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY;\n    Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,\n    Cities, labours, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these\n          me,\n    These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me\n          and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the\n          union of them, to afford the like to you?\n    Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you\n          also be eligible as I am?\n    How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect\n          bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?\n\n\n\n\nA BROADWAY PAGEANT\n\n\n    1\n\n    Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,\n    Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,\n    Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,\n    Ride to-day through Manhattan.\n\n    Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,\n    In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon, the errand-bearers,\n    Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks marching,\n    But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.\n\n    When million-footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements,\n    When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar I love,\n    When the round-mouth'd guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit\n          their salutes,\n    When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me, and heaven-clouds\n          canopy my city with a delicate thin haze,\n    When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at the wharves,\n          thicken with colours,\n    When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,\n    When pennants trail and street-festoons hang from the windows,\n    When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and\n          foot-standers, when the mass is densest,\n    When the facades of the houses are alive with people, when eyes gaze\n          riveted tens of thousands at a time,\n    When the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant moves\n          forward visible,\n    When the summons is made, when the answer that waited thousands of\n          years answers,\n    I too arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the\n          crowd, and gaze with them.\n\n\n    2\n\n    Superb-faced Manhattan!\n    Comrade Americanos! to us, then at last the Orient comes.\n\n    To us, my city,\n    Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite\n          sides, to walk in the space between,\n    To-day our Antipodes comes.\n\n    The Originatress comes,\n    The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,\n    Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,\n    Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,\n    With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,\n    The race of Brahma comes.\n\n    See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the\n          procession,\n    As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before\n          us.\n\n    For not the envoys nor the tann'd Japanee from his island only,\n    Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears, the Asiatic continent itself\n          appears, the past, the dead,\n    The murky night-morning of wonder and fable inscrutable,\n    The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,\n    The north, the sweltering south, eastern Assyria, the Hebrews, the\n          ancient of ancients,\n    Vast desolated cities, the gliding present, all of these and more\n          are in the pageant-procession.\n\n    Geography, the world, is in it,\n    The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond,\n    The coast you henceforth are facing--you Libertad! from your Western\n          golden shores,\n    The countries there with their populations, the millions en-masse are\n          curiously here,\n    The swarming market-places, the temples with idols ranged along the\n          sides or at the end, bonze, brahmin, and llama,\n    Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman,\n    The singing-girl and the dancing-girl, the ecstatic persons, the\n          secluded emperors,\n    Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors, the\n          castes, all,\n    Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the Altay mountains,\n    From Thibet, from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of China,\n    From the southern peninsulas and the demi-continental islands, from\n          Malaysia,\n    These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me, and are\n          seiz'd by me,\n    And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,\n    Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for you.\n\n    For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant,\n    I am the chanter, I chant aloud over the pageant,\n    I chant the world on my Western sea,\n    I chant copious the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky,\n    I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a vision it\n          comes to me,\n    I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,\n    I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those\n          groups of sea-islands,\n    My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes,\n    My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,\n    Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races reborn,\n          refresh'd,\n    Lives, works resumed--the object I know not--but the old, the Asiatic\n          renew'd as it must be,\n    Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.\n\n\n    3\n\n    And you Libertad of the world!\n    You shall sit in the middle well-pois'd thousands and thousands of\n          years,\n    As to-day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,\n    As to-morrow from the other side the queen of England sends her\n          eldest son to you.\n\n    The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,\n    The ring is circled, the journey is done,\n    The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless the perfume pours\n          copiously out of the whole box.\n\n    Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,\n    Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad, for you are all,\n    Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother now sending messages\n          over the archipelagoes to you,\n    Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.\n\n    Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?\n    Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long?\n    Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while\n          unknown, for you, for reasons?\n\n    They are justified, they are accomplish'd, they shall now be turn'd the\n          other way also, to travel toward you thence,\n    They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake Libertad.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRAIRIE STATES\n\n\n    A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude,\n    Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,\n    With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,\n    By all the world contributed--freedom's and law's and thrift's society,\n    The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,\n    To justify the past.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nPOEMS OF DEMOCRACY\n\n\n\n\nTO FOREIGN LANDS\n\n\n    I heard that you ask'd for something to prove this puzzle the New\n          World,\n    And to define America, her athletic Democracy,\n    Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\n\n\n\n\nTO THEE OLD CAUSE\n\n\n    To thee old cause!\n    Thou peerless, passionate, good cause,\n    Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\n    Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\n    After a strange sad war, great war for thee\n    (I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\n          really fought, for thee),\n    These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\n\n    (A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\n    Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this\n          book.)\n\n    Thou orb of many orbs!\n    Thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\n    Around the idea of thee the war revolving,\n    With all its angry and vehement play of causes\n    (With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years),\n    These recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,\n    Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\n    As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\n    Around the idea of thee.\n\n\n\n\nFOR YOU O DEMOCRACY\n\n\n    Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,\n    I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,\n    I will make divine magnetic lands,\n            With the love of comrades,\n              With the life-long love of comrades.\n\n    I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of\n          America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over\n          the prairies,\n    I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's\n          necks,\n            By the love of comrades,\n              By the manly love of comrades.\n\n    For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!\n    For you, for you I am trilling these songs.\n\n\n\n\nTHOU MOTHER WITH THY EQUAL BROOD\n\n\n    1\n\n    Thou Mother with thy equal brood,\n    Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,\n    A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,\n    For thee, the future.\n\n    I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,\n    I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,\n    I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd.\n\n    The paths to the house I seek to make,\n    But leave to those to come the house itself.\n\n    Belief I sing, and preparation;\n    As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,\n    But greater still from what is yet to come,\n    Out of that formula for thee I sing.\n\n\n    2\n\n    As a strong bird on pinions free,\n    Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,\n    Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,\n    Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.\n\n    The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,\n    Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,\n    Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor\n          library;\n    But an odour I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath\n          of an Illinois prairie,\n    With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas\n          uplands, or Florida's glades,\n    Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,\n    With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,\n    And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea-sound,\n    That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.\n\n    And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,\n    Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted for\n          thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,\n    Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou transcendental\n          Union!\n    By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,\n    Thought of man justified, blended with God,\n    Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!\n    Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!\n\n\n    3\n\n    Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,\n    To formulate the Modern--out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,\n    Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art\n    (Recast, maybe discard them, end them--maybe their work is done, who\n          knows?),\n    By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the\n          dead,\n    To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.\n\n    And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World\n          brain,\n    Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,\n    Thou carefully prepared by it so long--haply thou but unfoldest it,\n          only maturest it,\n    It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the bygone time contain'd in\n          thee,\n    Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with\n          reference to thee;\n    Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,\n    The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.\n\n\n    4\n\n    Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,\n    Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,\n    The Past is also stored in thee,\n    Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western\n          continent alone,\n    Earth's _resume_ entire floats on thy keel O ship, is steadied by thy\n          spars,\n    With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim\n          with thee,\n    With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou\n          bear'st the other continents,\n    Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant;\n    Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou carriest\n          great companions,\n    Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,\n    And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.\n\n\n    5\n\n    Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,\n    Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,\n    Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,\n    Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,\n    Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession\n          issuing,\n    Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength and\n          life,\n    World of the real--world of the twain in one,\n    World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to\n          identity, body, by it alone,\n    Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious\n          materials,\n    By history's cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither sent,\n    Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be constructed\n          here\n    (The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, literatures to\n          come),\n    Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform'd, neither do I define thee,\n    How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?\n    I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,\n    I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past,\n    I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire\n          globe,\n    But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,\n    I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,\n    I merely thee ejaculate!\n\n    Thee in thy future,\n    Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd mind, thy\n          soaring spirit,\n    Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-moving,\n          fructifying all,\n    Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great hilarity,\n    Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd so\n          long upon the mind of man,\n    The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;\n    Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male--thee in thy athletes,\n          moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,\n    (To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,\n          endear'd alike, forever equal),\n    Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but certain,\n    Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization (until which thy proudest\n          material civilization must remain in vain),\n    Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship--thee in no single\n          bible, saviour, merely,\n    Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant\n          within thyself, equal to any, divine as any\n    (Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars,\n          nor in thy century's visible growth,\n    But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great Mother!),\n    Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students,\n          born of thee,\n    Thee in thy democratic fetes en-masse, thy high original festivals,\n          operas, lecturers, preachers,\n    Thee in thy ultimata (the preparations only now completed, the\n          edifice on sure foundations tied),\n    Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational\n          joys, thy love and godlike aspiration,\n    In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung'd orators, thy\n          sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,\n    These! these in thee (certain to come), to-day I prophesy.\n\n\n    6\n\n    Land tolerating all, accepting all, not for the good alone, all good\n          for

       disease shalt swelter,\n    The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy breasts,\n          seeking to strike thee deep within,\n    Consumption of the worst, moral consumption, shall rouge thy face with\n          hectic,\n    But thou shalt face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them all,\n    Whatever they are to-day and whatever through time they may be,\n    They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee,\n    While thou, Time's spirals rounding, out of thyself, thyself still\n          extricating, fusing,\n    Equable, natural,

soul, its destinies, the real real\n    (Purport of all these apparitions of the real);\n    In thee America, the soul, its destinies,\n    Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous!\n    By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd (by these thyself\n          solidifying),\n    Thou mental, moral orb--thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World!\n    The Present holds thee not--for such vast growth as thine,\n    For such unparallel'd flight as thine, such brood as thine,\n    The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT BEST I SEE IN THEE\n\n_To U. S. G. return'd from his World's Tour._\n\n\n    What best I see in thee\n    Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,\n    Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,\n\n    Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,\n    Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted, venerable Asia swarm'd upon\n    Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's promenade;\n    But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,\n    Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,\n    Ohio's, Indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the\n          front,\n    Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world's\n          promenade,\n    Were all so justified.\n\n\n\n\nAS I WALK THESE BROAD MAJESTIC DAYS\n\n\n    As I walk these broad majestic days of peace\n    (For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific\n          Ideal,\n    Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won,\n    Now thou stridest on, yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,\n    Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,\n    Longer campaigns and crises, labours beyond all others),\n    Around me I hear that eclat of the world, politics, produce,\n    The announcements of recognized things, science,\n    The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions.\n\n    I see the ships (they will last a few years),\n    The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,\n    And hear the indorsement of all, and do not object to it.\n\n    But I too announce solid things,\n    Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing,\n    Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring,\n          triumphantly moving, and grander heaving in sight,\n    They stand for realities--all is as it should be.\n\n    Then my realities;\n    What else is so real as mine?\n    Libertad and the divine average, freedom to every slave on the face\n          of the earth,\n    The rapt promises and lumine of seers, the spiritual world, these\n          centuries-lasting songs,\n    And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements\n          of any.\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNITED STATES TO OLD WORLD CRITICS\n\n\n    Here first the duties of to-day, the lessons of the concrete,\n    Wealth, order, travel, shelter, products, plenty;\n    As of the building of some varied, vast, perpetual edifice,\n    Whence to arise inevitable in time, the towering roofs, the lamps,\n    The solid-planted spires tall shooting to the stars.\n\n\n\n\nYEARS OF THE MODERN\n\n\n    Years of the modern! years of the unperform'd!\n    Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,\n    I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other nations\n          preparing,\n    I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the\n          solidarity of races,\n    The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,\n    No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and\n          nights;\n    Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to\n          pierce it, is full of phantoms,\n    Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,\n    This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams O\n          years!\n    Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not\n          whether I sleep or wake.)\n    The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow\n          behind me,\n    The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.\n\n\n\n\nO STAR OF FRANCE\n\n    1870-71\n\n\n    O star of France,\n    The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,\n    Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,\n    Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,\n    And 'mid its teeming madden'd half-drown'd crowds,\n    Nor helm nor helmsman.\n\n    Dim smitten star,\n    Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul its dearest hopes,\n    The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,\n    Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast's dreams of\n          brotherhood,\n    Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.\n\n    Star crucified--by traitors sold,\n    Star panting o'er a land of death, heroic land,\n    Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.\n\n    Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke\n          thee,\n    Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,\n    And left thee sacred.\n\n    In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,\n    In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,\n    In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,\n    In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones\n          that shamed thee,\n    In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,\n    This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,\n    The spear thrust in thy side.\n\n    O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!\n    Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!\n\n    Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,\n    Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,\n    Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,\n    Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,\n    Onward beneath the sun following its course,\n    So thee O ship of France!\n\n    Finish'd the days, the clouds dispel'd,\n    The travail o'er, the long-sought extrication,\n    When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,\n    (In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours\n          Columbia),\n    Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,\n    In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,\n    Shall beam immortal.\n\n\n\n\nTHOUGHTS\n\n\n    1\n\n    Of these years I sing,\n    How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as through\n          parturitions,\n    How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure\n          fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people--illustrates\n          evil as well as good,\n    The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's-self;\n    How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,\n          obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,\n    How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or\n          see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results\n    (But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious and\n          inevitable, and they again leading to other results).\n\n    How the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,\n          wilful, as I love them,\n    How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sound\n          and resounding, keep on and on,\n    How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things ended and\n          things begun,\n    How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of\n          freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society,\n          and of all that is begun,\n    And how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs\n          and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\n    And how these of mine and of the States will in turn be convuls'd,\n          and serve other parturitions and transitions,\n    And how all people, sights, combinations, the Democratic masses too,\n          serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its\n          horrors, serves,\n    And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of\n          death.\n\n\n    2\n\n    Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,\n    Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to impregnable\n          and swarming places,\n    Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,\n    Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada,\n          and the rest\n    (Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska),\n    Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for--and of what\n          all sights, North, South, East and West, are,\n    Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the unnamed\n          lost ever present in my mind;\n    Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,\n    Of the present, passing, departing--of the growth of completer men\n          than any yet,\n    Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the\n          Mississippi flows,\n    Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,\n    Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of inalienable\n          homesteads,\n    Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and sweet\n          blood,\n    Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,\n    Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the\n          Anahuacs,\n    Of these songs, well understood there (being made for that area),\n    Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there\n    (O it lurks in me night and day--what is gain after all to savageness\n          and freedom?).\n\n\n\n\nBY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE\n\n\n    1\n\n    By blue Ontario's shore,\n    As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, and the dead\n          that return no more,\n    A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,\n    _Chant me the poem_, it said, _that comes from the soul of America,\n          chant me the carol of victory,\n    And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,\n    And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy._\n\n    (Democracy, the destin'd conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles\n          everywhere,\n    And death and infidelity at every step.)\n\n\n    2\n\n    A Nation announcing itself,\n    I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,\n    I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.\n\n    A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,\n    What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,\n    We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,\n    We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,\n    We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of\n          ourselves,\n    We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,\n    We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world,\n    From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.\n\n    Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,\n    Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or\n          sinful in ourselves only.\n\n    (O Mother--O Sisters dear!\n    If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,\n    It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)\n\n\n    3\n\n    Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?\n    There can be any number of supremes--one does not countervail another\n          any more than one eyesight countervails another, or one life\n          countervails another.\n\n    All is eligible to all,\n    All is for individuals, all is for you,\n    No condition is prohibited, not God's or any.\n\n    All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the universe.\n\n    Produce great Persons, the rest follows.\n\n\n    4\n\n    Piety and conformity to them that like,\n    Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,\n    I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,\n    Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives!\n\n    I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every\n         one I meet,\n    Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?\n    Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?\n\n    (With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children,\n    These clamours wild to a race of pride I give.)\n\n    O lands, would you be freer than all that has ever been before?\n    If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me.\n\n    Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,\n    Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey juice,\n    Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,\n    Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.\n\n\n    5\n\n    Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,\n    America brings builders, and brings its own styles.\n\n    The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and\n          pass'd to other spheres,\n    A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.\n\n    America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all\n          hazards,\n    Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true use of\n          precedents,\n    Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under their\n          forms,\n    Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne\n          from the house,\n    Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was\n          fittest for its days,\n    That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who\n          approaches,\n    And that he shall be fittest for his days.\n\n    Any period one nation must lead,\n    One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.\n\n    These States are the amplest poem,\n    Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,\n    Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the\n          day and night,\n    Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars,\n    Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul\n          loves,\n    Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the soul\n          loves.\n\n\n    6\n\n    Land of lands and bards to corroborate!\n    Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a west-bred face,\n    To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd both mother's and\n          father's,\n    His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,\n    Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,\n    Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,\n    Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with\n          incomparable love,\n    Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,\n    Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,\n    Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,\n    Mississippi with yearly freshets and hanging chutes, Columbia, Niagara,\n          Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,\n    If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he\n          stretching with them North or South,\n    Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever is\n          between them,\n    Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock,\n          live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange,\n          magnolia,\n    Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,\n    He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern\n          transparent ice,\n    Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,\n    Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-hawk,\n          mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle,\n    His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil,\n    Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,\n    Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,\n    Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and\n          muscle,\n    The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation of the\n          Constitution,\n    The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,\n    The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and\n          impregnable,\n    The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters,\n          trappers,\n    Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the\n          gestation of new States,\n    Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up\n          from the uttermost parts,\n    Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially\n          the young men,\n    Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they\n          have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the\n          presence of superiors,\n    The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and\n          decision of their phrenology,\n    The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when\n          wrong'd,\n    The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,\n          good temper and open-handdedness, the whole composite make,\n    The prevailing ardour and enterprise, the large amativeness,\n    The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement\n          of the population,\n    The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,\n    Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all\n          points,\n    Factories, mercantile life, labour-saving machinery, the Northeast,\n          Northwest, Southwest,\n    Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,\n    Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the\n          ruins of all the rest,\n    On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours\n          be the stake, and respite no more.\n\n\n    7\n\n    (Lo, high toward heaven, this day,\n    Libertad, from the conqueress' field return'd,\n    I mark the new aureola around your head,\n    No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,\n    With war's flames and the lambent lightnings playing,\n    And your port immovable where you stand,\n    With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch'd and lifted\n          fist,\n    And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner utterly\n          crush'd beneath you,\n    The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his senseless\n          scorn, bearing the murderous knife,\n    The wide-swelling one, the braggart that would yesterday do so much,\n    To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth,\n    An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)\n\n\n    8\n\n    Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever\n          keeps vista,\n    Others adorn the past, but you O days of the present, I adorn you,\n    O days of the future I believe in you--I isolate myself for your sake,\n    O America because you build for mankind I build for you,\n    O well-beloved stone-cutters, I lead them who plan with decision and\n          science,\n    Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.\n    (Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!\n    But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain, pains,\n          dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing.)\n\n\n    9\n\n    I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,\n    I heard the voice arising demanding bards,\n    By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be\n          fused into the compact organism of a nation.\n\n    To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,\n    That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living\n          principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres\n          of plants.\n\n    Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff\n          most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use them\n          the greatest,\n    Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their\n          poets shall.\n\n    (Soul of love and tongue of fire:\n    Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!\n    Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren,\n          barren?)\n\n\n    10\n\n    Of these States the poet is the equable man,\n    Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of\n          their full returns,\n    Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,\n    He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither\n          more nor less,\n    He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,\n    He is the equalizer of his age and land,\n    He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,\n    In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty\n          building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce,\n          lighting the study of man, the soul, health, immortality,\n          government,\n    In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as\n          good as the engineer's, he can make every word he speaks draw\n          blood,\n    The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,\n    He is no arguer, he is judgment (Nature accepts him absolutely),\n    He judges not as the judges but as the sun falling round a helpless\n          thing,\n    As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,\n    His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,\n    In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,\n    He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,\n    He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women as\n           dreams or dots.\n\n    For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,\n    For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,\n    The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.\n\n    Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,\n    They live in the feelings of young men and the best women\n    (Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always\n          ready to fall for Liberty).\n\n\n    11\n\n    For the great Idea,\n    That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.\n\n    Songs of stern defiance ever ready,\n    Songs of the rapid arming and the march,\n    The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,\n    Warlike flag of the great Idea.\n\n    (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!\n    I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,\n    I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight--O the\n         hard-contested fight!\n    The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles--the hurtled balls scream,\n    The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant\n          from the line,\n    Hark, the ringing word _Charge!_--now the tussle and the furious\n          maddening yells,\n    Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,\n    Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,\n    Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)\n\n\n    12\n\n    Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in the\n          States?\n    The place is august, the terms obdurate.\n\n    Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body and mind,\n    He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe himself,\n    He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern\n          questions.\n\n    Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America?\n    Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?\n    Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,\n          pride, freedom, friendship of the land? its substratums and\n          objects?\n    Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the\n          first year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners,\n          ratified by the States, and read by Washington at the head of\n          the army?\n    Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?\n\n    Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,\n          and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?\n    Are you faithful to things? do you teach what the land and sea, the\n          bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, heroic angers, teach?\n    Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?\n    Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce\n          contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the whole\n          People?\n    Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?\n    Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to life\n          itself?\n    Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States?\n    Have you too the old ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?\n    Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity? for the\n          last-born? little and big? and for the errant?\n\n    What is this you bring my America?\n    Is it uniform with my country?\n    Is it not something that has been better told or done before?\n    Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?\n    Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?--is the good old cause\n           in it?\n    Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,\n           literats, of enemies' lands?\n    Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?\n    Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?\n    Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the Union in that\n          secession war?\n    Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?\n    Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again in my\n          strength, gait, face?\n    Have real employments contributed to it? original makers, not mere\n          amanuenses?\n    Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?\n\n    What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities?\n          Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas?\n    Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians\n          standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics, Manhattanese,\n          Western men, Southerners, significant alike in their apathy,\n          and in the promptness of their love?\n    Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen, each\n          temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist, infidel,\n          who has ever ask'd any thing of America?\n    What mocking and scornful negligence?\n    The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons,\n    By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.\n\n\n    13\n\n    Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill'd from poems pass away,\n    The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,\n    Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of literature,\n    America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it or\n          conceal from it, it is impassive enough,\n    Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,\n    If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them, there\n          is no fear of mistake\n    (The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country\n          absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it).\n\n    He masters whose spirit masters, he tastes sweetest who results\n          sweetest in the long run,\n    The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;\n    In the need of songs, philosophy, an appropriate native grand-opera,\n          shipcraft, any craft,\n    He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical\n          example.\n\n    Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets,\n    People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers,\n    There will shortly be no more priests, I say their work is done,\n    Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies\n          here,\n    Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be superb,\n    Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power,\n    How dare you place any thing before a man?\n\n\n    14\n\n    Fall behind me States!\n    A man before all--myself, typical, before all.\n\n    Give me the pay I have served for,\n    Give to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest,\n    I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,\n    I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid and\n          crazy, devoted my income and labour to others,\n    Hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and indulgence\n          toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown,\n    Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young, and\n          with the mothers of families,\n    Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by trees,\n          stars, rivers,\n    Dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,\n    Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for\n          others on the same terms,\n    Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every State\n    (Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe his last,\n    This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,\n    To life recalling many a prostrate form);\n    I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of\n          myself,\n    Rejecting none, permitting all.\n\n    (Say O Mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?\n    Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?)\n\n\n    15\n\n    I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,\n    It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,\n    It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,\n    It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,\n    Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.\n\n    Underneath all, individuals,\n    I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,\n    The American compact is altogether with individuals,\n    The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,\n    The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single\n          individual--namely to You.\n\n    (Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your hand,\n    I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)\n\n\n    16\n\n    Underneath all, Nativity,\n    I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so be it;\n    I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity.\n    Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.\n\n    Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women\n    (I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing\n          love for men and women,\n    After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and\n          women).\n\n    I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself\n    (Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favour the\n          audacity and sublime turbulence of the States).\n\n    Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,\n          ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,\n    Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself (the same monotonous\n          old song).\n\n\n    17\n\n    O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,\n    Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,\n    Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,\n    Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships,\n          are you and me,\n    Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,\n    The war (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth\n          forget) was you and me,\n    Natural and artificial are you and me,\n    Freedom, language, forms, employments, are you and me,\n    Past, present, future, are you and me.\n\n    I dare not shirk any part of myself,\n    Not any part of America good or bad,\n    Not to build for that which builds for mankind,\n    Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,\n    Not to justify science nor the march of equality,\n    Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov'd of time.\n\n    I am for those that have never been master'd,\n    For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,\n    For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.\n\n    I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,\n    Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.\n\n    I will not be outfaced by irrational things,\n    I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,\n    I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,\n    This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount, and it I\n          teach again.\n\n    (Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,\n    I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams your\n          dilating form,\n    Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)\n\n\n    18\n\n    I will confront these shows of the day and night,\n    I will know if I am to be less than they,\n    I will see if I am not as majestic as they,\n    I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,\n    I will see if I am to be less generous than they,\n    I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have\n          meaning,\n    I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,\n          and I am not to be enough for myself.\n\n    I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,\n    Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the master\n          myself,\n    America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?\n    These States, what are they except myself?\n\n    I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my\n          sake,\n    I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.\n\n    (Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,\n    I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,\n    I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war and crime\n          your work goes on, and must yet go on.)\n\n\n    19\n\n    Thus by blue Ontario's shore,\n    While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward me,\n    I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my theme\n          was upon me,\n    Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.\n\n    And I saw the free souls of poets,\n    The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,\n    Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.\n\n\n    20\n\n    O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!\n    Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch'd you\n          forth,\n    Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,\n    Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.\n\n    Bards for my own land only I invoke\n    (For the war, the war is over, the field is clear'd),\n    Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,\n    To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.\n\n    Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the\n          war, the war is over!)\n    Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,\n    Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's fork'd\n          stripes!\n    Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards--bards of California! inland bards--bards\n          of the war!\n    You by my charm I invoke.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nRISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS\n\n\n\n\nRISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS\n\n\n    1\n\n    Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer\n          sweep,\n    Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave me,\n    Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,\n    I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd the\n          Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus\n    I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,\n    I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm\n    I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,\n    I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over.\n    I heard the wind piping; I saw the black clouds,\n    Saw from below what arose and mounted (O superb! O wild as my heart,\n          and powerful!),\n    Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,\n    Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast\n          amid the din they chased each other across the sky;\n    These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive\n          and masterful,\n    All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,\n    Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.\n\n\n    2\n\n    'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,\n    Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,\n    Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,\n    Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,\n    Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,\n    Torrents of men (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed\n          inexhaustible?),\n    What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of the\n          mountains and sea?\n    What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?\n    Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?\n    Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,\n    Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,\n          unchain'd;\n    What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,\n    How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!\n    How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the\n          flashes of lightning!\n    How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through\n          the dark by those flashes of lightning!\n    (Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,\n    In a lull of the deafening confusion.)\n\n\n    3\n\n    Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!\n    And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!\n    Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,\n    My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong\n          nutriment,\n    Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only half\n          satisfied,\n    One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground\n          before me,\n    Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing\n          low;\n    The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the\n          certainties suitable to me,\n    Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's\n          dauntlessness,\n    I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,\n    I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I\n          waited long;\n    But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,\n    I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities\n          electric,\n    I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,\n    Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,\n    No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    THE END\n\n    [Illustration]\n\n    THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS\n    GARDEN CITY, N.

When one recalls the published love-letters\nof Abelard, of Dorothy Osborne, of Lady Hamilton, of Mary Wollstonecraft,\nof Margaret Fuller, of George Sand, Bismarck, Shelley, Victor Hugo, Edgar\nAllan Poe, and--to mention only one more illustrious example--of the\nBrownings, one must needs look upon this form of presenting biographical\nmaterial as a well-established, if not a valuable, convention of letters.\n\nAs to the particular set of letters presented to the reader in this\nvolume, a word of explanation and history may be required. Most of these\nletters are from Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, a few are replies to her\nletters, and a few are letters from her children to Whitman. Mrs.\nGilchrist died in 1885. When, two years later, her son, Herbert\nHarlakenden Gilchrist, was collecting material for his interesting\nbiography of his mother, Whitman was asked for the letters that she had\nwritten to him--or rather for extracts from them. In reply to this request\nthe poet said, \"I do not know that I can furnish any good reason, but I\nfeel to keep these utterances exclusively to myself. But I cannot let your\nbook go to press without at least saying--and wishing it put on\nrecord--that among the perfect women I have met (and it has been my\nunspeakably good fortune to have had the very best, for mother, sisters,\nand friends) I have known none more perfect in every relation, than my\ndear, dear friend, Anne Gilchrist.\" But since Whitman carefully preserved\nthem for twenty years, refusing to destroy them as he had destroyed such\nother written matter as he did not care to have preserved, it would appear\nthat he intended that so beautiful a tribute to the poetry that he had\nwritten, no less than to the personality of the poet, should be included\nin that complete biography which is being slowly written, by many hands,\nof America's most unique man of genius. In any case, when these letters\ncame into my hands in the apportionment of Whitman's literary legacy under\nthe will which named me as one of his three literary executors, there were\nbut three things which I could honourably do with them--rather, on closer\nanalysis, there seemed to be but one. To leave them in _my_ will or to\nplace them in some public repository would have been to shift a\nresponsibility which was evidently mine to the shoulders of others who,\nperhaps, would be in possession of fewer facts in the light of which to\ndischarge that responsibility. To destroy them would be to do what Whitman\nshould have done if it was to be done at all, and to erase forever one of\nthe finest tributes that either the man or the poet ever received, one of\nthe most touching self-revelations that a noble soul ever \"poured out on\npaper.\" The remaining alternative was to edit and publish them (after\nkeeping them a proper length of time), for the benefit, not only of the\ngeneral reader, but as an aid to the future biographer who from the\nproper perspective will write the life of America's great poet and\nprophet. In this determination my judgment has been confirmed by that of\nthe few sympathetic friends who, during the twenty-five years that the\nletters have been in my possession, have been allowed to read them.\n\nIt is a matter of regret that so few of Whitman's letters to Mrs.\nGilchrist are available. Those included in this volume, sometimes in\nfragmentary form, have been taken from loose copies found among his papers\nafter his death, or, in a few instances, are reprinted from Herbert\nHarlakenden Gilchrist's \"Anne Gilchrist\" or Horace Traubel's \"With Walt\nWhitman in Camden.\" Acknowledgment of these latter is made in each\ninstance. But though Whitman's letters printed in this correspondence will\nnot compare with Mrs. Gilchrist's in point of number, enough are presented\nto suggest the tenor of them all.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the first love-letter from Anne Gilchrist to Walt\nWhitman was in the form of an essay written in his defense called \"An\nEnglishwoman's Estimate of Walt Whitman.\" For that reason this well-known\nessay is reprinted in this volume; and \"A Confession of Faith,\" in reality\nan amplification of the \"Estimate\" written several years after the\npublication of the latter, is included. The reader who desires to follow\nthe story of this friendship in a chronological order will do well to read\nat least the former of these tributes before beginning the letters.\nIndebtedness is acknowledged to Prof. Emory Halloway of Brooklyn, New\nYork, for valuable suggestions.\n\nT. B. H.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nUndoubtedly Mrs. Gilchrist's \"Estimate of Walt Whitman,\" published in the\n(Boston) _Radical_ in May, 1870, was the finest, as it was the first,\npublic tribute ever paid to the poet by a woman. Whitman himself so\nconsidered it--\"the proudest word that ever came to me from a woman--if\nnot the proudest word of all from any source.\" But a finer tribute was to\nfollow, in the sacred privacy of the love-letters which are now made\npublic forty years and more after they were written. The purpose of this\nIntroduction is not to interpret those letters, but to sketch the story in\nthe light of which they are to be read. And since both Anne Gilchrist and\nWalt Whitman have had sympathetic and painstaking biographers, it will not\nbe necessary here to mention at length the already known facts of their\nrespective lives.\n\nThe story naturally begins with Whitman. He was born at West Hills, Long\nIsland, New York, on May 31, 1819. His father was of English descent, and\ncame of a family of sailors and farmers. His mother, to whom he himself\nattributed most of his personal qualities, was of excellent Hollandic\nstock. Moving to Brooklyn while still in frocks, he there passed his\nboyhood and youth, but took many summer trips to visit relatives in the\ncountry. He early left the public school for the printing offices of\nlocal newspapers, picking enough general knowledge to enable him, when\nabout seventeen years of age, to teach schools in the rural districts of\nhis native island. Very early in life he became a writer, chiefly of short\nprose tales and essays, which were accepted by the best New York\nmagazines. His literary and journalistic work was not confined to the\nmetropolis, but took him, for a few months in 1848, so far away from home\nas New Orleans. In 1851-54, besides writing for and editing newspapers, he\nwas engaged in housebuilding, the trade of his father. Although this was,\nit is said, a profitable business, he gave it up to write poetry, and\nissued his first volume, \"Leaves of Grass,\" in 1855. The book had been\nwritten with great pains, according to a preconceived plan of the author\nto be stated in the preface; and it was finally set up (by his own hands,\nfor want of a publisher) only, as he tells us, after many \"doings and\nundoings, leaving out the stock 'poetical' touches.\" Its publication was\nthe occasion of probably the most voluminous controversy of American\nletters--mostly abuse, ridicule, and condemnation.\n\nIn 1862 Whitman's brother George, who had volunteered in the Union Army,\nwas reported badly wounded in the Fredericksburg fight. Walt, going at\nonce to the war front in Virginia, found that his brother's wound was not\nserious enough to require his ministrations, but gradually he became\nengaged in nursing other wounded soldiers, until this work, as a volunteer\nhospital missionary in Washington, engrossed the major part of his time.\nThis continued until and for some years after the end of the war.\nWhitman's own needs were supplied by occasional literary work and from his\nearnings as a clerk first in the Interior and later in the Attorney\nGeneral's Department. He had gone to Washington a man of strong and\nmajestic physique, but his untiring devotion, fidelity, and vigilance in\nnursing the sick and wounded soldiers in the army hospitals in and about\nWashington was soon to shatter that constitution which was ever a marvel\nto its possessor, and to condemn him to pass the last two decades of his\nlife in unaccustomed invalidism. The history of the Civil War in America\npresents no instance of nobler fulfilment of duty or of sublimer\nsacrifice.\n\nMeanwhile his muse was not neglected. His book had gone through four\neditions, and, with the increment of the noble war poetry of \"Drum Taps,\"\nhad become a volume of size. At a very early period \"Leaves of Grass\" had\nbeen hailed as an important literary contribution by a few of the best\nthinkers in this country and in England but, generally speaking, nearly\nall literary persons received it with much criticism and many\nqualifications. In Washington devoted disciples like William Douglas\nO'Connor and John Burroughs never varied in their uncompromising adherence\nto the book and its author. This appreciation only by the few was likewise\nencountered in England. The book had made a stir among the literary\nclasses, but its importance was not at all generally recognized. Men like\nJohn Addington Symonds, Edward Dowden, and William Michael Rossetti were,\nhowever, almost unrestricted in their praise.\n\nIt was William Rossetti who planned, in 1867, to bring out in England a\nvolume of selections from Whitman's poetry, in the belief that it was\nbetter to leave out the poems that had provoked such adverse criticism, in\norder to get Whitman a foothold among those who might prefer to have an\nexpurgated edition. Whitman's attitude toward the plan at the time is\ngiven in a letter which he wrote to Rossetti on December 3, 1867: \"I\ncannot and will not consent of my own volition to countenance an\nexpurgated edition of my pieces. I have steadily refused to do so under\nseductive offers, here in my own country, and must not do so in another\ncountry.\" It appeared, however, that Rossetti had already advanced his\nproject, and Whitman graciously added: \"If, before the arrival of this\nletter, you have practically invested in, and accomplished, or partially\naccomplished, any plan, even contrary to this letter, I do not expect you\nto abandon it, at loss of outlay; but shall _bona fide_ consider you\nblameless if you let it go on, and be carried out, as you may have\narranged. It is the question of the authorization of an expurgated edition\nproceeding from me, that deepest engages me. The facts of the different\nways, one way or another way, in which the book may appear in England, out\nof influences not under the shelter of my umbrage, are of much less\nimportance to me. After making the foregoing explanation, I shall, I\nthink, accept kindly whatever happens. For I feel, indeed know, that I am\nin the hands of a friend, and that my pieces will receive that truest,\nbrightest of light and perception coming from love. In that, all other\nand lesser requisites become pale....\" The Rossetti \"Selections\" duly\nappeared--with what momentous influence upon the two persons whose\nfriendship we are tracing will presently be shown.\n\nOn June 22, 1869, Anne Gilchrist, writing to Rossetti, said: \"I was\ncalling on Madox Brown a fortnight ago, and he put into my hands your\nedition of Walt Whitman's poems. I shall not cease to thank him for that.\nSince I have had it, I can read no other book: it holds me entirely\nspellbound, and I go through it again and again with deepening delight and\nwonder. How can one refrain from expressing gratitude to you for what you\nhave so admirably done?...\" To this Rossetti promptly responded: \"Your\nletter has given me keen pleasure this morning. That glorious man Whitman\nwill one day be known as one of the greatest sons of Earth, a few steps\nbelow Shakespeare on the throne of immortality. What a tearing-away of the\nobscuring veil of use and wont from the visage of man and of life! I am\ndoing myself the pleasure of at once ordering a copy of the \"Selections\"\nfor you, which you will be so kind as to accept. Genuine--i. e.,\n_enthusiastic_--appreciators are not so common, and must be cultivated\nwhen they appear.... Anybody who values Whitman as you do ought to read\nthe whole of him....\" At a later date Rossetti gave Mrs. Gilchrist a copy\nof the complete \"Leaves of Grass,\" in acknowledging which she said, \"The\ngift of yours I have not any words to tell you how priceless it will be to\nme....\" This lengthy letter was later, at Rossetti's solicitation, worked\nover for publication as the \"Estimate of Walt Whitman\" to which reference\nhas already been made.\n\nAnne Gilchrist was primarily a woman of letters. Though her natural bent\nwas toward science and philosophy, her marriage threw her into association\nwith artists and writers of _belles lettres_. She was born in London on\nFebruary 25, 1828. She came of excellent ancestry, and received a good\neducation, particularly in music. She had a profoundly religious nature,\nalthough it appears that she was never a believer in many of the orthodox\nChristian doctrines. Very early in life she recognized the greatness of\nsuch men as Emerson and Comte. In 1851, at the age of twenty-three, she\nmarried Alexander Gilchrist, two months her junior. Though of limited\nmeans, he possessed literary ability and was then preparing for the bar.\nHis early writings secured for him the friendship of Carlyle, who for\nyears lived next door to the Gilchrists in Cheyne Row. This friendship led\nto others, and the Gilchrists were soon introduced into that supreme\nliterary circle which included Ruskin, Herbert Spencer, George Eliot, the\nRossettis, Tennyson, and many another great mind of that illustrious age.\n\nWithin ten years of their marriage the Gilchrists had four children, in\nwhom they were very happy. But in the year 1861, when Anne was\nthirty-three years of age, her husband died. It was a terrible blow, but\nshe faced the future unflinchingly, and reared her children, giving to\neach of them a profession. At the time of her husband's death his life of\nWilliam Blake was nearing completion. With the assistance of William and\nGabriel Rossetti Mrs. Gilchrist finished the work on this excellent\nbiography, and it was published by Macmillan. Whitman has paid a fitting\ntribute to the pluck exhibited in this achievement: \"Do you know much of\nBlake?\" said Whitman to Horace Traubel, who records the conversation in\nhis remarkable book \"With Walt Whitman in Camden.\" \"You know, this is Mrs.\nGilchrist's book--the book she completed. They had made up their minds to\ndo the work--her husband had it well under way: he caught a fever and was\ncarried off. Mrs. Gilchrist was left with four young children, alone: her\nperplexities were great. Have you noticed that the time to look for the\nbest things in best people is the moment of their greatest need? Look at\nLincoln: he is our proudest example: he proved to be big as, bigger than,\nany emergency--his grasp was a giant's grasp--made dark things light, made\nhard things easy.... (Mrs. Gilchrist) belonged to the same noble breed:\nseized the reins, was competent; her head was clear, her hand was firm.\"\n\nThe circumstances under which she first read Whitman's poetry have been\nnarrated. When in 1869 Whitman became aware of the Rossetti\ncorrespondence, he felt greatly honoured, and through Rossetti he sent his\nportrait to the as yet anonymous lady. In acknowledging this communication\nhis English friend has a grateful word from \"the lady\" to return: \"I gave\nyour letter, and the second copy of your portrait, to the lady you refer\nto, and need scarcely say how truly delighted she was. She has asked me to\nsay that you could not have devised for her a more welcome pleasure, and\nthat she feels grateful to me for having sent to America the extracts from\nwhat she had written, since they have been a satisfaction to you....\"\nEarly in 1870 the \"Estimate\" appeared in the _Radical_, still more than a\nyear before Mrs. Gilchrist addressed her first letter to Whitman. He\nwelcomed the essay, and its author as a new and peculiarly powerful\nchampion of \"Leaves of Grass.\" To Rossetti he wrote: \"I am deeply touched\nby these sympathies and convictions, coming from a woman and from England,\nand am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to\nget them, she would not only pardon you for transmitting them but approve\nthat action. I realize indeed of this smiling and emphatic _well done_\nfrom the heart and conscience of a true wife and mother, and one, too,\nwhose sense of the poetic, as I glean from your letter, after flowing\nthrough the heart and conscience, must also move through and satisfy\nscience as much as the esthetic, that I had hitherto received no eulogium\nso magnificent.\" Concerning this experience Whitman said to Horace\nTraubel, at a much later period: \"You can imagine what such a thing as her\n'Estimate' meant to me at that time. Almost everybody was against me--the\npapers, the preachers, the literary gentlemen--nearly everybody with only\nhere and there a dissenting voice--when it looked on the surface as if my\nenterprise was bound to fail ... then this wonderful woman. Such things\nstagger a man ... I had got so used to being ignored or denounced that the\nappearance of a friend was always accompanied with a sort of shock....\nThere are shocks that knock you up, shocks that knock you down. Mrs.\nGilchrist never wavered from her first decision. I have that sort of\nfeeling about her which cannot easily be spoken of--...: love (strong\npersonal love, too), reverence, respect--you see, it won't go into words:\nall the words are weak and formal.\" Speaking again of her first criticism\nof his work, he said: \"I remember well how one of my noblest, best\nfriends--one of my wisest, cutest, profoundest, most candid critics--how\nMrs. Gilchrist, even to the last, insisted that \"Leaves of Grass\" was not\nthe mouthpiece of parlours, refinements--no--but the language of strength,\npower, passion, intensity, absorption, sincerity....\" He claimed a closer\nrelationship to her than he allowed to Rossetti: \"Rossetti mentions Mrs.\nGilchrist. Well, he had a right to--almost as much right as I had: a sort\nof brother's right: she was his friend, she was more than my friend. I\nfeel like Hamlet when he said forty thousand brothers could not feel what\nhe felt for Ophelia. After all ... we were a family--a happy family: the\nfew of us who got together, going with love the same way--we were a happy\nfamily. The crowd was on the other side but we were on our side--we: a few\nof us, just a few: and despite our paucity of numbers we made ourselves\ntell for the good cause.\"\n\nFrom these expressions it is quite clear that Whitman's attitude toward\nMrs. Gilchrist was at first that of the unpopular prophet who finds a\nworthy and welcome disciple in an unexpected place. And that he should\nhave so felt was but natural, for she had been drawn to him, as she\nconfided to him in one of her letters, by what he had written rather than\nand not by her knowledge of the man. There can be no doubt, however, that\non Mrs. Gilchrist's part something more than the friendship of her\nnew-found liberator was desired. When she read the \"Leaves of Grass\" she\nwas forty-one years of age, in the full vigour of womanhood. To her the\nreading meant a new birth, causing her to pour out her soul to the prophet\nand poet across the seas with a freedom and abandon that were phenomenal.\nThis was in the first letter printed in this volume, under date of\nSeptember 3, 1871, and about the time that Whitman had sent to his new\nsupporter a copy of his poems. Perhaps the strongest reason why Whitman\ndid not reply to passion with passion lies in the fact that his heart was,\nso far as attachments of that sort were concerned, already bestowed\nelsewhere. I am indebted to Professor Holloway for the information that\nWhitman was, in 1864, the unfortunate lover of a certain lady whose\nprevious marriage to another, while it did not dim their mutual devotion,\ndid serve to keep them apart. To her Whitman wrote that heart-wrung lyric\nof separation, \"Out of the rolling ocean, the crowd.\" This suggests that\nthere was probably a double tragedy, so ironical is the fate of the\naffections, Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman both passionately yearning for\npersonal love yet unable to quench the one desire in the other.\n\nBut if there could not be between them the love which leads to marriage,\nthere could be a noble and tender and life-long friendship. Over this\nWhitman's loss of his magnificent health, to be followed by an invalidism\nof twenty years, had no power. In 1873 Whitman was stricken with\nparalysis, which rendered him so helpless that he had to give up his work\nand finally his position, and to go to live for the rest of his life in\nCamden, New Jersey. Mrs. Gilchrist's affection for him did not waver when\nthis trial was made of it. Indeed, his illness had the effect, as these\nletters show, of quickening the desire which she had had for several years\n(since 1869) of coming to live in America, that she might be near him to\nlighten his burdens, and, if she could not hope to cherish him as a wife,\nthat she might at least care for him as a mother. Whitman, it will be\nnoted, strongly advised against this plan. Just why he wished to keep her\naway from America is unclear, possibly because he dared not put so\nidealistic a friendship and discipleship to the test of personal\nacquaintance with a prematurely broken old man. Nevertheless, on August\n30, 1876, Mrs. Gilchrist set sail, with three of her children, for\nPhiladelphia. They arrived in September. From that date until the spring\nof 1878 the Gilchrists kept house at 1929 North Twenty-second street,\nPhiladelphia, where Whitman was a frequent and regular visitor.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Mrs. Gilchrist's appreciation of Whitman\ndid not lessen after she had met and known him in the intimacy of that\ntea-table circle which at her house discussed the same great variety of\ntopics--literature, religion, science, politics--that had enlivened the\nO'Connor breakfast table in Washington. She shall describe it and him\nherself. In a letter to Rossetti, under date of December 22, 1876, she\nwrites: \"But I need not tell you that our greatest pleasure is the society\nof Mr. Whitman, who fully realizes the ideal I had formed from his poems,\nand brings such an atmosphere of cordiality and geniality with him as is\nindescribable. He is really making slow but, I trust, steady progress\ntoward recovery, having been much cheered (and no doubt that acted\nfavourably upon his health) by the sympathy manifested toward him in\nEngland and the pleasure of finding so many buyers of his poems there. It\nmust be a deep satisfaction to you to have been the channel through which\nthis help and comfort flowed....\" And a year later she writes to the same\ncorrespondent: \"We are having delightful evenings this winter; how often\ndo I wish you could make one in the circle around our tea table where sits\non my right hand every evening but Sunday Walt Whitman. He has made great\nprogress in health and recovered powers of getting about during the year\nwe have been here: nevertheless the lameness--the dragging instead of\nlifting the left leg continues; and this together with his white hair and\nbeard give him a look of age curiously contradicted by his face, which has\nnot only the ruddy freshness but the full, rounded contours of youth,\nnowhere drawn or wrinkled or sunk; it is a face as indicative of serenity\nand goodness and of mental and bodily health as the brow is of\nintellectual power. But I notice he occasionally speaks of himself as\nhaving a 'wounded brain,' and of being still quite altered from his former\nself.\"\n\nWhitman, on his part, thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon sunshine of such\nfriendly hospitality, for he considered Mrs. Gilchrist even more gifted as\na conversationalist than as a writer. For hints of the sort of talk that\nflowed with Mrs. Gilchrist's tea I must refer the reader to her son's\nrealistic biography.\n\nAfter two years of residence in Philadelphia, the Gilchrists went to dwell\nin Boston and later in New York City, and met the leaders in the two\nliterary capitals. From these addresses the letters begin again, after the\nnatural interruption of two years. It is at this time that the first\nletters from Herbert and Beatrice Gilchrist were written. These are given\nin this volume to complete the chain and to show how completely they were\nin sympathy with their mother in their love and appreciation of Whitman.\nFrom New York they all sailed for their old home in England on June 7,\n1879. Whitman came the day before to wish them good voyage. The chief\nreason for the return to England seems to have been the desire to send\nBeatrice to Berne to complete her medical education. After the return to\nEngland, or rather while they are still en route at Glasgow, the letters\nbegin again.\n\nSeveral years of literary work yet remained to Mrs. Gilchrist. The chief\nwritings of these years were a new edition of the Blake, a life of Mary\nLamb for the Eminent Women Series, an article on Blake for the Dictionary\nof National Biography, several essays including \"Three Glimpses of a New\nEngland Village,\" and the \"Confession of Faith.\" She was beginning a\ncareful study of the life and writings of Carlyle, with the intention of\nwriting a life of her old friend to reply to the aspersions of Freude.\nThis last work was, however, never completed, for early in 1882 some\nmalady which rendered her breathing difficult had already begun to cast\nthe shadow of death upon her. But her faith, long schooled in the optimism\nof \"Leaves of Grass,\" looked upon the steadily approaching end with\ncalmness. On November 29, 1885, she died.\n\nWhen Whitman was informed of her death by Herbert Gilchrist, he could find\nwords for only the following brief reply:\n\n     _15th December 1885.\n     Camden, United States, America._\n\n     DEAR HERBERT:\n\n     I have received your letter. Nothing now remains but a sweet and rich\n     memory--none more beautiful all time, all life all the earth--I\n     cannot write anything of a letter to-day. I must sit alone and think.\n\n     WALT WHITMAN.\n\nLater, in conversations with Horace Traubel which the latter has preserved\nin his minute biography of Whitman, he was able to express his regard for\nMrs. Gilchrist more fully--\"a supreme character of whom the world knows\ntoo little for its own good ... If her sayings had been recorded--I do not\nsay she would pale, but I do say she would equal the best of the women of\nour century--add something as great as any to the testimony on the side of\nher sex.\" And at another time: \"Oh! she was strangely different from the\naverage; entirely herself; as simple as nature; true, honest; beautiful as\na tree is tall, leafy, rich, full, free--_is_ a tree. Yet, free as she\nwas by nature, bound by no conventionalisms, she was the most courageous\nof women; more than queenly; of high aspect in the best sense. She was not\ncold; she had her passions; I have known her to warm up--to resent\nsomething that was said; some impeachment of good things--great things; of\na person sometimes; she had the largest charity, the sweetest fondest\noptimism.... She was a radical of radicals; enjoyed all sorts of high\nenthusiasms: was exquisitely sensitized; belonged to the times yet to\ncome; her vision went on and on.\"\n\nThis searching interpretation of her character wants only her artist son's\ndescription of her personal appearance to make the final picture complete:\n\"A little above the average height, she walked with an even, light step.\nBrown hair concealed a full and finely chiselled brow, and her hazel eyes\nbent upon you a bright and penetrating gaze. Whilst conversing her face\nbecame radiant as with an experience of golden years; humour was present\nin her conversation--flecks of sunshine, such as sometimes play about the\nminds of deeply religious natures. Her animated manner seldom flagged, and\ncharmed the taciturn to talking in his or her best humour.\" Once, when\nspeaking to Walt Whitman of the beauty of the human speaking voice, he\nreplied: \"The voice indicates the soul. Hers, with its varied modulations\nand blended tones, was the tenderest, most musical voice ever to bless our\nears.\"\n\nHer death was a long-lasting shock to Whitman. \"She was a wonderful\nwoman--a sort of human miracle to me.... Her taking off ... was a great\nshock to me: I have never quite got over it: she was near to me: she was\nsubtle: her grasp on my work was tremendous--so sure, so all around, so\nadequate.\" If this sounds a trifle self-centred in its criticism, not so\nwas the poem which, in memory of her, he wrote as a fitting epitaph from\nthe poet she had loved.\n\n\n\"GOING SOMEWHERE\"\n\n  My science-friend, my noblest woman-friend (Now buried in an English\n      grave--and this a memory-leaf for her dear sake),\n  Ended our talk--\"The sum, concluding all we know of old or modern\n      learning, intuitions deep,\n  Of all Geologies--Histories--of all Astronomy--of Evolution, Metaphysics\n      all,\n  Is, that we all are onward, onward, speeding slowly, surely bettering,\n  Life, life an endless march, an endless army (no halt, but, it is duly\n      over),\n  The world, the race, the soul--in space and time the universes,\n  All bound as is befitting each--all surely going somewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LETTERS OF ANNE GILCHRIST AND WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n\n\nA WOMAN'S ESTIMATE OF WALT WHITMAN[1]\n\n[FROM LETTERS BY ANNE GILCHRIST TO W. M. ROSSETTI.]\n\n\n_June 23, 1869._--I am very sure you are right in your estimate of Walt\nWhitman. There is nothing in him that I shall ever let go my hold of. For\nme the reading of his poems is truly a new birth of the soul.\n\nI shall quite fearlessly accept your kind offer of the loan of a complete\nedition, certain that great and divinely beautiful nature has not, could\nnot infuse any poison into the wine he has poured out for us. And as for\nwhat you specially allude to, who so well able to bear it--I will say, to\njudge wisely of it--as one who, having been a happy wife and mother, has\nlearned to accept all things with tenderness, to feel a sacredness in all?\nPerhaps Walt Whitman has forgotten--or, through some theory in his head,\nhas overridden--the truth that our instincts are beautiful facts of\nnature, as well as our bodies; and that we have a strong instinct of\nsilence about some things.\n\n_July 11._--I think it was very manly and kind of you to put the whole of\nWalt Whitman's poems into my hands; and that I have no other friend who\nwould have judged them and me so wisely and generously.\n\nI had not dreamed that words could cease to be words, and become electric\nstreams like these. I do assure you that, strong as I am, I feel sometimes\nas if I had not bodily strength to read many of these poems. In the series\nheaded \"Calamus,\" for instance, in some of the \"Songs of Parting,\" the\n\"Voice out of the Sea,\" the poem beginning \"Tears, Tears,\" &c., there is\nsuch a weight of emotion, such a tension of the heart, that mine refuses\nto beat under it,--stands quite still,--and I am obliged to lay the book\ndown for a while. Or again, in the piece called \"Walt Whitman,\" and one or\ntwo others of that type, I am as one hurried through stormy seas, over\nhigh mountains, dazed with sunlight, stunned with a crowd and tumult of\nfaces and voices, till I am breathless, bewildered, half dead. Then come\nparts and whole poems in which there is such calm wisdom and strength of\nthought, such a cheerful breadth of sunshine, that the soul bathes in them\nrenewed and strengthened. Living impulses flow out of these that make me\nexult in life, yet look longingly towards \"the superb vistas of Death.\"\nThose who admire this poem, and don't care for that, and talk of\nformlessness, absence of metre, &c., are quite as far from any genuine\nrecognition of Walt Whitman as his bitter detractors. Not, of course, that\nall the pieces are equal in power and beauty, but that all are vital; they\ngrew--they were not made. We criticise a palace or a cathedral; but what\nis the good of criticising a forest? Are not the hitherto-accepted\nmasterpieces of literature akin rather to noble architecture; built up of\nmaterial rendered precious by elaboration; planned with subtile art that\nmakes beauty go hand in hand with rule and measure, and knows where the\nlast stone will come, before the first is laid; the result stately, fixed,\nyet such as might, in every particular, have been different from what it\nis (therefore inviting criticism), contrasting proudly with the careless\nfreedom of nature, opposing its own rigid adherence to symmetry to her\nwillful dallying with it? But not such is this book. Seeds brought by the\nwinds from north, south, east, and west, lying long in the earth, not\nresting on it like the stately building, but hid in and assimilating it,\nshooting upwards to be nourished by the air and the sunshine and the rain\nwhich beat idly against that,--each bough and twig and leaf growing in\nstrength and beauty its own way, a law to itself, yet, with all this\nfreedom of spontaneous growth, the result inevitable, unalterable\n(therefore setting criticism at naught), above all things, vital,--that\nis, a source of ever-generating vitality: such are these poems.\n\n  \"Roots and leaves themselves alone are these,\n  Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and from the\n      pondside,\n  Breast sorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter than\n      vines,\n  Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun\n      is risen,\n  Breezes of land and love, breezes set from living shores out to you on\n      the living sea,--to you, O sailors!\n  Frost-mellowed berries and Third-month twigs, offered fresh to young\n      persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,\n  Love-buds put before you and within you, whoever you are,\n  Buds to be unfolded on the old terms.\n  If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will open, and bring\n      form, colour, perfume, to you:\n  If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become flowers, fruits,\n      tall branches and trees.\"\n\nAnd the music takes good care of itself, too. As if it _could_ be\notherwise! As if those \"large, melodious thoughts,\" those emotions, now so\nstormy and wild, now of unfathomed tenderness and gentleness, could fail\nto vibrate through the words in strong, sweeping, long-sustained chords,\nwith lovely melodies winding in and out fitfully amongst them! Listen, for\ninstance, to the penetrating sweetness, set in the midst of rugged\ngrandeur, of the passage beginning,--\n\n  \"I am he that walks with the tender and growing night;\n  I call to the earth and sea half held by the night.\"\n\nI see that no counting of syllables will reveal the mechanism of the\nmusic; and that this rushing spontaneity could not stay to bind itself\nwith the fetters of metre. But I know that the music is there, and that I\nwould not for something change ears with those who cannot hear it. And I\nknow that poetry must do one of two things,--either own this man as equal\nwith her highest completest manifestors, or stand aside, and admit that\nthere is something come into the world nobler, diviner than herself, one\nthat is free of the universe, and can tell its secrets as none before.\n\nI do not think or believe this; but see it with the same unmistakable\ndefiniteness of perception and full consciousness that I see the sun at\nthis moment in the noonday sky, and feel his rays glowing down upon me as\nI write in the open air. What more can you ask of the works of a man's\nmouth than that they should \"absorb into you as food and air, to appear\nagain in your strength, gait, face,\"--that they should be \"fibre and\nfilter to your blood,\" joy and gladness to your whole nature?\n\nI am persuaded that one great source of this kindling, vitalizing power--I\nsuppose _the_ great source--is the grasp laid upon the present, the\nfearless and comprehensive dealing with reality. Hitherto the leaders of\nthought have (except in science) been men with their faces resolutely\nturned backwards; men who have made of the past a tyrant that beggars and\nscorns the present, hardly seeing any greatness but what is shrouded away\nin the twilight, underground past; naming the present only for disparaging\ncomparisons, humiliating distrust that tends to create the very barrenness\nit complains of; bidding me warm myself at fires that went out to mortal\neyes centuries ago; insisting, in religion above all, that I must either\n\"look through dead men's eyes,\" or shut my own in helpless darkness. Poets\nfancying themselves so happy over the chill and faded beauty of the past,\nbut not making me happy at all,--rebellious always at being dragged down\nout of the free air and sunshine of to-day.\n\nBut this poet, this \"athlete, full of rich words, full of joy,\" takes you\nby the hand, and turns you with your face straight forwards. The present\nis great enough for him, because he is great enough for it. It flows\nthrough him as a \"vast oceanic tide,\" lifting up a mighty voice. Earth,\n\"the eloquent, dumb, great mother,\" is not old, has lost none of her fresh\ncharms, none of her divine meanings; still bears great sons and daughters,\nif only they would possess themselves and accept their birthright,--a\nricher, not a poorer, heritage than was ever provided before,--richer by\nall the toil and suffering of the generations that have preceded, and by\nthe further unfolding of the eternal purposes. Here is one come at last\nwho can show them how; whose songs are the breath of a glad, strong,\nbeautiful life, nourished sufficingly, kindled to unsurpassed intensity\nand greatness by the gifts of the present.\n\n  \"Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy.\"\n\n  \"O the joy of my soul leaning poised on itself,--receiving identity\n      through materials, and loving them,--observing characters, and\n      absorbing them!\n  O my soul vibrated back to me from them!\n\n  \"O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!\n  The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist, fresh\n      stillness of the woods,\n  The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through the\n      forenoon.\n\n  \"O to realize space!\n  The plenteousness of all--that there are no bounds;\n  To emerge, and be of the sky--of the sun and moon and the flying clouds,\n      as one with them.\n\n  \"O the joy of suffering,--\n  To struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted,\n  To be entirely alone with them--to find how much one can stand!\"\n\nI used to think it was great to disregard happiness, to press on to a high\ngoal, careless, disdainful of it. But now I see that there is nothing so\ngreat as to be capable of happiness; to pluck it out of \"each moment and\nwhatever happens\"; to find that one can ride as gay and buoyant on the\nangry, menacing, tumultuous waves of life as on those that glide and\nglitter under a clear sky; that it is not defeat and wretchedness which\ncome out of the storm of adversity, but strength and calmness.\n\nSee, again, in the pieces gathered together under the title \"Calamus,\" and\nelsewhere, what it means for a man to love his fellow-man. Did you dream\nit before? These \"evangel-poems of comrades and of love\" speak, with the\nabiding, penetrating power of prophecy, of a \"new and superb friendship\";\nspeak not as beautiful dreams, unrealizable aspirations to be laid aside\nin sober moods, because they breathe out what now glows within the poet's\nown breast, and flows out in action toward the men around him. Had ever\nany land before her poet, not only to concentrate within himself her life,\nand, when she kindled with anger against her children who were treacherous\nto the cause her life is bound up with, to announce and justify her\nterrible purpose in words of unsurpassable grandeur (as in the poem\nbeginning, \"Rise, O days, from your fathomless deeps\"), but also to go\nand with his own hands dress the wounds, with his powerful presence soothe\nand sustain and nourish her suffering soldiers,--hundreds of them,\nthousands, tens of thousands,--by day and by night, for weeks, months,\nyears?\n\n  \"I sit by the restless all the dark night; some are so young,\n  Some suffer so much: I recall the experience sweet and sad.\n  Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested,\n  Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips:--\"\n\nKisses, that touched with the fire of a strange, new, undying eloquence\nthe lips that received them! The most transcendent genius could not,\nuntaught by that \"experience sweet and sad,\" have breathed out hymns for\nher dead soldiers of such ineffably tender, sorrowful, yet triumphant\nbeauty.\n\nBut the present spreads before us other things besides those of which it\nis easy to see the greatness and beauty; and the poet would leave us to\nlearn the hardest part of our lesson unhelped if he took no heed of these;\nand would be unfaithful to his calling, as interpreter of man to himself\nand of the scheme of things in relation to him, if he did not accept\nall--if he did not teach \"the great lesson of reception, neither\npreference nor denial.\" If he feared to stretch out the hand, not of\ncondescending pity, but of fellowship, to the degraded, criminal, foolish,\ndespised, knowing that they are only laggards in \"the great procession\nwinding along the roads of the universe,\" \"the far-behind to come on in\ntheir turn,\" knowing the \"amplitude of Time,\" how could he roll the stone\nof contempt off the heart as he does, and cut the strangling knot of the\nproblem of inherited viciousness and degradation? And, if he were not bold\nand true to the utmost, and did not own in himself the threads of darkness\nmixed in with the threads of light, and own it with the same strength and\ndirectness that he tells of the light, and not in those vague generalities\nthat everybody uses, and nobody means, in speaking on this head,--in the\nworst, germs of all that is in the best; in the best, germs of all that is\nin the worst,--the _brotherhood_ of the human race would be a mere\nflourish of rhetoric. And brotherhood is naught if it does not bring\nbrother's love along with it. If the poet's heart were not \"a measureless\nocean of love\" that seeks the lips and would quench the thirst of all, he\nwere not the one we have waited for so long. Who but he could put at last\nthe right meaning into that word \"democracy,\" which has been made to bear\nsuch a burthen of incongruous notions?\n\n  \"By God! I will have nothing that all cannot have their counterpart of\n      on the same terms!\"\n\nflashing it forth like a banner, making it draw the instant allegiance of\nevery man and woman who loves justice. All occupations, however homely,\nall developments of the activities of man, need the poet's recognition,\nbecause every man needs the assurance that for him also the materials out\nof which to build up a great and satisfying life lie to hand, the sole\nmagic in the use of them, all of the right stuff in the right hands.\nHence those patient enumerations of every conceivable kind of industry:--\n\n  \"In them far more than you estimated--in them far less also.\"\n\nFar more as a means, next to nothing as an end: whereas we are wont to\ntake it the other way, and think the result something, but the means a\nweariness. Out of all come strength, and the cheerfulness of strength. I\nmurmured not a little, to say the truth, under these enumerations, at\nfirst. But now I think that not only is their purpose a justification, but\nthat the musical ear and vividness of perception of the poet have enabled\nhim to perform this task also with strength and grace, and that they are\nharmonious as well as necessary parts of the great whole.\n\nNor do I sympathize with those who grumble at the unexpected words that\nturn up now and then. A quarrel with words is always, more or less, a\nquarrel with meanings; and here we are to be as genial and as wide as\nnature, and quarrel with nothing. If the thing a word stands for exists by\ndivine appointment (and what does not so exist?), the word need never be\nashamed of itself; the shorter and more direct, the better. It is a gain\nto make friends with it, and see it in good company. Here at all events,\n\"poetic diction\" would not serve,--not pretty, soft, colourless words,\nlaid by in lavender for the special uses of poetry, that have had none of\nthe wear and tear of daily life; but such as have stood most, as tell of\nhuman heart-beats, as fit closest to the sense, and have taken deep hues\nof association from the varied experiences of life--those are the words\nwanted here. We only ask to seize and be seized swiftly, over-masteringly,\nby the great meanings. We see with the eyes of the soul, listen with the\nears of the soul; the poor old words that have served so many generations\nfor purposes, good, bad, and indifferent, and become warped and blurred in\nthe process, grow young again, regenerate, translucent. It is not mere\ndelight they give us,--_that_ the \"sweet singers,\" with their subtly\nwrought gifts, their mellifluous speech, can give too in their degree; it\nis such life and health as enable us to pluck delights for ourselves out\nof every hour of the day, and taste the sunshine that ripened the corn in\nthe crust we eat (I often seem to myself to do that).\n\nOut of the scorn of the present came skepticism; and out of the large,\nloving acceptance of it comes faith. If _now_ is so great and beautiful, I\nneed no arguments to make me believe that the _nows_ of the past and of\nthe future were and will be great and beautiful, too.\n\n  \"I know I am deathless.\n  I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter's compass.\n  I know I shall not pass, like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick\n      at night.\n  I know I am august.\n  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.\n\n  \"My foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite:\n  I laugh at what you call dissolution,\n  And I know the amplitude of Time.\"\n\n  \"No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and Death.\"\n\nYou argued rightly that my confidence would not be betrayed by any of the\npoems in this book. None of them troubled me even for a moment; because I\nsaw at a glance that it was not, as men had supposed, the heights brought\ndown to the depths, but the depths lifted up level with the sunlit\nheights, that they might become clear and sunlit, too. Always, for a\nwoman, a veil woven out of her own soul--never touched upon even, with a\nrough hand, by this poet. But, for a man, a daring, fearless pride in\nhimself, not a mock-modesty woven out of delusions--a very poor imitation\nof a woman's. Do they not see that this fearless pride, this complete\nacceptance of themselves, is needful for her pride, her justification?\nWhat! is it all so ignoble, so base, that it will not bear the honest\nlight of speech from lips so gifted with \"the divine power to use words?\"\nThen what hateful, bitter humiliation for her, to have to give herself up\nto the reality! Do you think there is ever a bride who does not taste more\nor less this bitterness in her cup? But who put it there? It must surely\nbe man's fault, not God's, that she has to say to herself, \"Soul, look\nanother way--you have no part in this. Motherhood is beautiful, fatherhood\nis beautiful; but the dawn of fatherhood and motherhood is not beautiful.\"\nDo they really think that God is ashamed of what he has made and\nappointed? And, if not, surely it is somewhat superfluous that they should\nundertake to be so for him.\n\n  \"The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\"\n\nOf a woman above all. It is true that instinct of silence I spoke of is a\nbeautiful, imperishable part of nature, too. But it is not beautiful when\nit means an ignominious shame brooding darkly. Shame is like a very\nflexible veil, that follows faithfully the shape of what it\ncovers,--beautiful when it hides a beautiful thing, ugly when it hides an\nugly one. It has not covered what was beautiful here; it has covered a\nmean distrust of a man's self and of his Creator. It was needed that this\nsilence, this evil spell, should for once be broken, and the daylight let\nin, that the dark cloud lying under might be scattered to the winds. It\nwas needed that one who could here indicate for us \"the path between\nreality and the soul\" should speak. That is what these beautiful, despised\npoems, the \"Children of Adam,\" do, read by the light that glows out of the\nrest of the volume: light of a clear, strong faith in God, of an\nunfathomably deep and tender love for humanity,--light shed out of a soul\nthat is \"possessed of itself.\"\n\n  \"Natural life of me faithfully praising things,\n  Corroborating for ever the triumph of things.\"\n\nNow silence may brood again; but lovingly, happily, as protecting what is\nbeautiful, not as hiding what is unbeautiful; consciously enfolding a\nsweet and sacred mystery--august even as the mystery of Death, the dawn as\nthe setting: kindred grandeurs, which to eyes that are opened shed a\nhallowing beauty on all that surrounds and preludes them.\n\n  \"O vast and well-veiled Death!\n\n  \"O the beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,\n      for reasons!\"\n\nHe who can thus look with fearlessness at the beauty of Death may well\ndare to teach us to look with fearless, untroubled eyes at the perfect\nbeauty of Love in all its appointed realizations. Now none need turn away\ntheir thoughts with pain or shame; though only lovers and poets may say\nwhat they will,--the lover to his own, the poet to all, because all are in\na sense his own. None need fear that this will be harmful to the woman.\nHow should there be such a flaw in the scheme of creation that, for the\ntwo with whom there is no complete life, save in closest sympathy, perfect\nunion, what is natural and happy for the one should be baneful to the\nother? The utmost faithful freedom of speech, such as there is in these\npoems, creates in her no thought or feeling that shuns the light of\nheaven, none that are not as innocent and serenely fair as the flowers\nthat grow; would lead, not to harm, but to such deep and tender affection\nas makes harm or the thought of harm simply impossible. Far more beautiful\ncare than man is aware of has been taken in the making of her, to fit her\nto be his mate. God has taken such care that _he_ need take none; none,\nthat is, which consists in disguisement, insincerity, painful hushing-up\nof his true, grand, initiating nature. And, as regards the poet's\nutterances, which, it might be thought, however harmless in themselves,\nwould prove harmful by falling into the hands of those for whom they are\nmanifestly unsuitable, I believe that even here fear is needless. For her\ninnocence is folded round with such thick folds of ignorance, till the\nright way and time for it to accept knowledge, that what is unsuitable is\nalso unintelligible to her; and, if no dark shadow from without be cast on\nthe white page by misconstruction or by foolish mystery and hiding away of\nit, no hurt will ensue from its passing freely through her hands.\n\nThis is so, though it is little understood or realized by men. Wives and\nmothers will learn through the poet that there is rejoicing grandeur and\nbeauty there wherein their hearts have so longed to find it; where foolish\nmen, traitors to themselves, poorly comprehending the grandeur of their\nown or the beauty of a woman's nature, have taken such pains to make her\nbelieve there was none,--nothing but miserable discrepancy.\n\nOne of the hardest things to make a child understand is, that down\nunderneath your feet, if you go far enough, you come to blue sky and stars\nagain; that there really is no \"down\" for the world, but only in every\ndirection an \"up.\" And that this is an all-embracing truth, including\nwithin its scope every created thing, and, with deepest significance,\nevery part, faculty, attribute, healthful impulse, mind, and body of a\nman (each and all facing towards and related to the Infinite on every\nside), is what we grown children find it hardest to realize, too. Novalis\nsaid, \"We touch heaven when we lay our hand on the human body\"; which, if\nit mean anything, must mean an ample justification of the poet who has\ndared to be the poet of the body as well as of the soul,--to treat it with\nthe freedom and grandeur of an ancient sculptor.\n\n  \"Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy of the muse:--I say the\n      form complete is worthier far.\n\n  \"These are not parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul.\n\n  \"O, I say now these are soul.\"\n\nBut while Novalis--who gazed at the truth a long way off, up in the air,\nin a safe, comfortable, German fashion--has been admiringly quoted by high\nauthorities, the great American who has dared to rise up and wrestle with\nit, and bring it alive and full of power in the midst of us, has been\ngreeted with a very different kind of reception, as has happened a few\ntimes before in the world in similar cases. Yet I feel deeply persuaded\nthat a perfectly fearless, candid, ennobling treatment of the life of the\nbody (so inextricably intertwined with, so potent in its influence on the\nlife of the soul) will prove of inestimable value to all earnest and\naspiring natures, impatient of the folly of the long-prevalent belief that\nit is because of the greatness of the spirit that it has learned to\ndespise the body, and to ignore its influences; knowing well that it is,\non the contrary, just because the spirit is not great enough, not healthy\nand vigorous enough, to transfuse itself into the life of the body,\nelevating that and making it holy by its own triumphant intensity;\nknowing, too, how the body avenges this by dragging the soul down to the\nlevel assigned itself. Whereas the spirit must lovingly embrace the body,\nas the roots of a tree embrace the ground, drawing thence rich\nnourishment, warmth, impulse. Or, rather, the body is itself the root of\nthe soul--that whereby it grows and feeds. The great tide of healthful\nlife that carries all before it must surge through the whole man, not beat\nto and fro in one corner of his brain.\n\n  \"O the life of my senses and flesh, transcending my senses and flesh!\"\n\nFor the sake of all that is highest, a truthful recognition of this life,\nand especially of that of it which underlies the fundamental ties of\nhumanity--the love of husband and wife, fatherhood, motherhood--is needed.\nReligion needs it, now at last alive to the fact that the basis of all\ntrue worship is comprised in \"the great lesson of reception, neither\npreference nor denial,\" interpreting, loving, rejoicing in all that is\ncreated, fearing and despising nothing.\n\n  \"I accept reality, and dare not question it.\"\n\nThe dignity of a man, the pride and affection of a woman, need it too. And\nso does the intellect. For science has opened up such elevating views of\nthe mystery of material existence that, if poetry had not bestirred\nherself to handle this theme in her own way, she would have been left\nbehind by her plodding sister. Science knows that matter is not, as we\nfancied, certain stolid atoms which the forces of nature vibrate through\nand push and pull about; but that the forces and the atoms are one\nmysterious, imperishable identity, neither conceivable without the other.\nShe knows, as well as the poet, that destructibility is not one of\nnature's words; that it is only the relationship of things--tangibility,\nvisibility--that are transitory. She knows that body and soul are one, and\nproclaims it undauntedly, regardless, and rightly regardless, of\ninferences. Timid onlookers, aghast, think it means that soul is\nbody--means death for the soul. But the poet knows it means body is\nsoul--the great whole imperishable; in life and in death continually\nchanging substance, always retaining identity. For, if the man of science\nis happy about the atoms, if he is not baulked or baffled by apparent\ndecay or destruction, but can see far enough into the dimness to know that\nnot only is each atom imperishable, but that its endowments,\ncharacteristics, affinities, electric and other attractions and\nrepulsions--however suspended, hid, dormant, masked, when it enters into\nnew combinations--remain unchanged, be it for thousands of years, and,\nwhen it is again set free, manifest themselves in the old way, shall not\nthe poet be happy about the vital whole? shall the highest force, the\nvital, that controls and compels into complete subservience for its own\npurposes the rest, be the only one that is destructible? and the love and\nthought that endow the whole be less enduring than the gravitating,\nchemical, electric powers that endow its atoms? But identity is the\nessence of love and thought--I still I, you still you. Certainly no man\nneed ever again be scared by the \"dark hush\" and the little handful of\nrefuse.\n\n  \"You are not scattered to the winds--you gather certainly and safely\n      around yourself.\"\n\n  \"Sure as Life holds all parts together, Death holds all parts together.\"\n\n  \"All goes onward and outward: nothing collapses.\"\n\n  \"What I am, I am of my body; and what I shall be, I shall be of my\n      body.\"\n\n  \"The body parts away at last for the journeys of the soul.\"\n\nScience knows that whenever a thing passes from a solid to a subtle air,\npower is set free to a wider scope of action. The poet knows it too, and\nis dazzled as he turns his eyes toward \"the superb vistas of death.\" He\nknows that \"the perpetual transfers and promotions\" and \"the amplitude of\ntime\" are for a man as well as for the earth. The man of science, with\nunwearied, self-denying toil, finds the letters and joins them into words.\nBut the poet alone can make complete sentences. The man of science\nfurnishes the premises; but it is the poet who draws the final conclusion.\nBoth together are \"swiftly and surely preparing a future greater than all\nthe past.\" But, while the man of science bequeaths to it the fruits of\nhis toil, the poet, this mighty poet, bequeaths himself--\"Death making him\nreally undying.\" He will \"stand as nigh as the nighest\" to these men and\nwomen. For he taught them, in words which breathe out his very heart and\nsoul into theirs, that \"love of comrades\" which, like the \"soft-born\nmeasureless light,\" makes wholesome and fertile every spot it penetrates\nto, lighting up dark social and political problems, and kindling into a\ngenial glow that great heart of justice which is the life-source of\nDemocracy. He, the beloved friend of all, initiated for them a \"new and\nsuperb friendship\"; whispered that secret of a godlike pride in a man's\nself, and a perfect trust in woman, whereby their love for each other, no\nlonger poisoned and stifled, but basking in the light of God's smile, and\nsending up to him a perfume of gratitude, attains at last a divine and\ntender completeness. He gave a faith-compelling utterance to that \"wisdom\nwhich is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and of\nthe excellence of things.\" Happy America, that he should be her son! One\nsees, indeed, that only a young giant of a nation could produce this kind\nof greatness, so full of the ardour, the elasticity, the inexhaustible\nvigour and freshness, the joyousness, the audacity of youth. But I, for\none, cannot grudge anything to America. For, after all, the young giant is\nthe old English giant--the great English race renewing its youth in that\nmagnificent land, \"Mexican-breathed, Arctic-braced,\" and girding up its\nloins to start on a new career that shall match with the greatness of the\nnew home.\n\n\n\n\nA CONFESSION OF FAITH[2]\n\n\n\"Of genius in the Fine Arts,\" wrote Wordsworth, \"the only infallible sign\nis the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight, honour,\nand benefit of human nature. Genius is the introduction of a new element\ninto the intellectual universe, or, if that be not allowed, it is the\napplication of powers to objects on which they had not before been\nexercised, or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce\neffects hitherto unknown. What is all this but an advance or conquest made\nby the soul of the poet? Is it to be supposed that the reader can make\nprogress of this kind like an Indian prince or general stretched on his\npalanquin and borne by slaves? No; he is invigorated and inspirited by his\nleader in order that he may exert himself, for he cannot proceed in\nquiescence, he cannot be carried like a dead weight. Therefore to create\ntaste is to call forth and bestow power.\"\n\nA great poet, then, is \"a challenge and summons\"; and the question first\nof all is not whether we like or dislike him, but whether we are capable\nof meeting that challenge, of stepping out of our habitual selves to\nanswer that summons. He works on Nature's plan: Nature, who teaches\nnothing but supplies infinite material to learn from; who never preaches\nbut drives home her meanings by the resistless eloquence of effects.\nTherefore the poet makes greater demands upon his reader than any other\nman. For it is not a question of swallowing his ideas or admiring his\nhandiwork merely, but of seeing, feeling, enjoying, as he sees, feels,\nenjoys. \"The messages of great poems to each man and woman are,\" says Walt\nWhitman, \"come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We\nare no better than you; what we enclose you enclose, what we enjoy you may\nenjoy\"--no better than you potentially, that is; but if you would\nunderstand us the potential must become the actual, the dormant sympathies\nmust awaken and broaden, the dulled perceptions clear themselves and let\nin undreamed of delights, the wonder-working imagination must respond, the\near attune itself, the languid soul inhale large draughts of love and hope\nand courage, those \"empyreal airs\" that vitalize the poet's world. No\nwonder the poet is long in finding his audience; no wonder he has to abide\nthe \"inexorable tests of Time,\" which, if indeed he be great, slowly turns\nthe handful into hundreds, the hundreds into thousands, and at last having\ndone its worst, grudgingly passes him on into the ranks of the Immortals.\n\nMeanwhile let not the handful who believe that such a destiny awaits a man\nof our time cease to give a reason for the faith that is in them.\n\nSo far as the suffrages of his own generation go Walt Whitman may, like\nWordsworth, tell of the \"love, the admiration, the indifference, the\nslight, the aversion, and even the contempt\" with which his poems have\nbeen received; but the love and admiration are from even a smaller\nnumber, the aversion, the contempt more vehement, more universal and\npersistent than Wordsworth ever encountered. For the American is a more\ndaring innovator; he cuts loose from precedent, is a very Columbus who has\nsailed forth alone on perilous seas to seek new shores, to seek a new\nworld for the soul, a world that shall give scope and elevation and beauty\nto the changed and changing events, aspirations, conditions of modern\nlife. To new aims, new methods; therefore let not the reader approach\nthese poems as a judge, comparing, testing, measuring by what has gone\nbefore, but as a willing learner, an unprejudiced seeker for whatever may\ndelight and nourish and exalt the soul. Neither let him be abashed nor\ndaunted by the weight of adverse opinion, the contempt and denial which\nhave been heaped upon the great American even though it be the contempt\nand denial of the capable, the cultivated, the recognized authorities; for\nsuch is the usual lot of the pioneer in whatever field. In religion it is\nabove all to the earnest and conscientious believer that the Reformer has\nappeared a blasphemer, and in the world of literature it is equally\nnatural that the most careful student, that the warmest lover of the\naccepted masterpieces, should be the most hostile to one who forsakes the\nmethods by which, or at any rate, in company with which, those triumphs\nhave been achieved. \"But,\" said the wise Goethe, \"I will listen to any\nman's convictions; you may keep your doubts, your negations to yourself, I\nhave plenty of my own.\" For heartfelt convictions are rare things.\nTherefore I make bold to indicate the scope and source of power in Walt\nWhitman's writings, starting from no wider ground than their effect upon\nan individual mind. It is not criticism I have to offer; least of all any\ndiscussion of the question of form or formlessness in these poems, deeply\nconvinced as I am that when great meanings and great emotions are\nexpressed with corresponding power, literature has done its best, call it\nwhat you please. But my aim is rather to suggest such trains of thought,\nsuch experience of life as having served to put me _en rapport_ with this\npoet may haply find here and there a reader who is thereby helped to the\nsame end. Hence I quote just as freely from the prose (especially from\n\"Democratic Vistas\" and the preface to the first issue of \"Leaves of\nGrass,\" 1855) as from his poems, and more freely, perhaps, from those\nparts that have proved a stumbling-block than from those whose conspicuous\nbeauty assures them acceptance.\n\nFifteen years ago, with feelings partly of indifference, partly of\nantagonism--for I had heard none but ill words of them--I first opened\nWalt Whitman's poems. But as I read I became conscious of receiving the\nmost powerful influence that had ever come to me from any source. What was\nthe spell? It was that in them humanity has, in a new sense, found itself;\nfor the first time has dared to accept itself without disparagement,\nwithout reservation. For the first time an unrestricted faith in all that\nis and in the issues of all that happens has burst forth triumphantly into\nsong.\n\n  \"... The rapture of the hallelujah sent\n  From all that breathes and is ...\"\n\nrings through these poems. They carry up into the region of Imagination\nand Passion those vaster and more profound conceptions of the universe and\nof man reached by centuries of that indomitably patient organized search\nfor knowledge, that \"skilful cross-questioning of things\" called science.\n\n  \"O truth of the earth I am determined to press my way toward you.\n  Sound your voice! I scale the mountains, I dive in the sea after you,\"\n\ncried science; and the earth and the sky have answered, and continue\ninexhaustibly to answer her appeal. And now at last the day dawns which\nWordsworth prophesied of: \"The man of science,\" he wrote, \"seeks truth as\na remote and unknown benefactor; he cherishes and loves it in his\nsolitude. The Poet, singing a song in which all human beings join with\nhim, rejoices in the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly\ncompanion. Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is\nthe impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science, it\nis the first and last of all knowledge; it is immortal as the heart of\nman. If the labours of men of science should ever create any material\nrevolution, direct or indirect, in our condition, and in the impressions\nwhich we habitually receive, the Poet will then sleep no more than at\npresent; he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science not\nonly in those general indirect effects, but he will be at his side\ncarrying sensation into the midst of the objects of science itself. If the\ntime should ever come when what is now called science, thus familiarized\nto man, shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh and blood,\nthe Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration, and will\nwelcome the being thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the\nhousehold of man.\" That time approaches: a new heaven and a new earth\nawait us when the knowledge grasped by science is realized, conceived as a\nwhole, related to the world within us by the shaping spirit of\nimagination. Not in vain, already, for this Poet have they pierced the\ndarkness of the past, and read here and there a word of the earth's\nhistory before human eyes beheld it; each word of infinite significance,\nbecause involving in it secrets of the whole. A new anthem of the slow,\nvast, mystic dawn of life he sings in the name of humanity.\n\n  \"I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I am an encloser of things to\n      be.\n\n  \"My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs;\n  On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps;\n  All below duly travell'd and still I mount and mount.\n\n  \"Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me:\n  Afar down I see the huge first Nothing--I know\n  I was even there;\n  I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,\n  And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\n  \"Long I was hugg'd close--long and long.\n\n  \"Immense have been the preparations for me,\n  Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\n  Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen;\n  For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\n  They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\n  \"Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me;\n  My embryo has never been torpid--nothing could overlay it.\n\n  \"For it the nebula cohered to an orb,\n  The long slow strata piled to rest it on,\n  Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,\n  Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with\n      care.\n\n  \"All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me;\n  Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul.\"\n\nNot in vain have they pierced space as well as time and found \"a vast\nsimilitude interlocking all.\"\n\n  \"I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\n  And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cypher, edge but the rim of\n      the farther systems.\n\n  \"Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\n  Outward, and outward, and for ever outward.\n\n  \"My sun has his sun, and round him obediently wheels,\n  He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\n  And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.\n\n  \"There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage;\n  If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were\n      this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in\n      the long run;\n  We should surely bring up again where we now stand,\n  And as surely go as much farther--and then farther and farther.\"\n\nNot in vain for him have they penetrated into the substances of things to\nfind that what we thought poor, dead, inert matter is (in Clerk Maxwell's\nwords) \"a very sanctuary of minuteness and power where molecules obey the\nlaws of their existence, and clash together in fierce collision, or\ngrapple in yet more fierce embrace, building up in secret the forms of\nvisible things\"; each stock and stone a busy group of Ariels plying\nobediently their hidden tasks.\n\n  \"Why! who makes much of a miracle?\n  As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles,\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  \"To me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,\n  Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,\n  Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the\n      same, ...\n  Every spear of grass--the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women,\n      and all that concerns them,\n  All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.\"\n\nThe natural _is_ the supernatural, says Carlyle. It is the message that\ncomes to our time from all quarters alike; from poetry, from science, from\nthe deep brooding of the student of human history. Science materialistic?\nRather it is the current theology that is materialistic in comparison.\nScience may truly be said to have annihilated our gross and brutish\nconceptions of matter, and to have revealed it to us as subtle, spiritual,\nenergetic beyond our powers of realization. It is for the Poet to increase\nthese powers of realization. He it is who must awaken us to the perception\nof a new heaven and a new earth here where we stand on this old earth. He\nit is who must, in Walt Whitman's words, indicate the path between reality\nand the soul.\n\nAbove all is every thought and feeling in these poems touched by the light\nof the great revolutionary truth that man, unfolded through vast stretches\nof time out of lowly antecedents, is a rising, not a fallen creature;\nemerging slowly from purely animal life; as slowly as the strata are piled\nand the ocean beds hollowed; whole races still barely emerged, countless\nindividuals in the foremost races barely emerged: \"the wolf, the snake,\nthe hog\" yet lingering in the best; but new ideals achieved, and others\ncome in sight, so that what once seemed fit is fit no longer, is adhered\nto uneasily and with shame; the conflicts and antagonisms between what we\ncall good and evil, at once the sign and the means of emergence, and\nneeding to account for them no supposed primeval disaster, no outside\npower thwarting and marring the Divine handiwork, the perfect fitness to\nits time and place of all that has proceeded from the Great Source. In a\nword that Evil is relative; is that which the slowly developing reason and\nconscience bid us leave behind. The prowess of the lion, the subtlety of\nthe fox, are cruelty and duplicity in man.\n\n  \"Silent and amazed, when a little boy,\n  I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,\n  As contending against some being or influence.\"\n\nsays the poet. And elsewhere, \"Faith, very old now, scared away by\nscience\"--by the daylight science lets in upon our miserable, inadequate,\nidolatrous conceptions of God and of His works, and on the\nsophistications, subterfuges, moral impossibilities, by which we have\nendeavoured to reconcile the irreconcilable--the coexistence of omnipotent\nGoodness and an absolute Power of Evil--\"Faith must be brought back by the\nsame power that caused her departure: restored with new sway, deeper,\nwider, higher than ever.\" And what else, indeed, at bottom, is science so\nbusy at? For what is Faith? \"Faith,\" to borrow venerable and unsurpassed\nwords, \"is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not\nseen.\" And how obtain evidence of things not seen but by a knowledge of\nthings seen? And how know what we may hope for, but by knowing the truth\nof what is, here and now? For seen and unseen are parts of the Great\nWhole: all the parts interdependent, closely related; all alike have\nproceeded from and are manifestations of the Divine Source. Nature is not\nthe barrier between us and the unseen but the link, the communication;\nshe, too, has something behind appearances, has an unseen soul; she, too,\nis made of \"innumerable energies.\" Knowledge is not faith, but it is\nfaith's indispensable preliminary and starting ground. Faith runs ahead to\nfetch glad tidings for us; but if she start from a basis of ignorance and\nillusion, how can she but run in the wrong direction? \"Suppose,\" said that\nimpetuous lover and seeker of truth, Clifford, \"Suppose all moving things\nto be suddenly stopped at some instant, and that we could be brought\nfresh, without any previous knowledge, to look at the petrified scene. The\nspectacle would be immensely absurd. Crowds of people would be senselessly\nstanding on one leg in the street looking at one another's backs; others\nwould be wasting their time by sitting in a train in a place difficult to\nget at, nearly all with their mouths open, and their bodies in some\ncontorted, unrestful posture. Clocks would stand with their pendulums on\none side. Everything would be disorderly, conflicting, in its wrong place.\nBut once remember that the world is in motion, is going somewhere, and\neverything will be accounted for and found just as it should be. Just so\ngreat a change of view, just so complete an explanation is given to us\nwhen we recognize that the nature of man and beast and of all the world is\n_going somewhere_. The maladaptions in organic nature are seen to be steps\ntoward the improvement or discarding of imperfect organs. The _baneful\nstrife which lurketh inborn in us, and goeth on the way with us to hurt\nus_, is found to be the relic of a time of savage or even lower\ncondition.\" \"Going somewhere!\" That is the meaning then of all our\nperplexities! That changes a mystery which stultified and contradicted the\nbest we knew into a mystery which teaches, allures, elevates; which\nharmonizes what we know with what we hope. By it we begin to\n\n  \"... see by the glad light,\n  And breathe the sweet air of futurity.\"\n\nThe scornful laughter of Carlyle as he points with one hand to the\nbaseness, ignorance, folly, cruelty around us, and with the other to the\nstill unsurpassed poets, sages, heroes, saints of antiquity, whilst he\nutters the words \"progress of the species!\" touches us no longer when we\nhave begun to realize \"the amplitude of time\"; when we know something of\nthe scale by which Nature measures out the years to accomplish her\nsmallest essential modification or development; know that to call a few\nthousands or tens of thousands of years antiquity, is to speak as a child,\nand that in her chronology the great days of Egypt and Syria, of Greece\nand Rome are affairs of yesterday.\n\n  \"Each of us inevitable;\n  Each of us limitless--each of us with his or her right upon the earth;\n  Each of us allow'd the eternal purports of the earth;\n  Each of us here as divinely as any are here.\n\n  \"You Hottentot with clicking palate! You woolly hair'd hordes!\n  You own'd persons, dropping sweat-drops or blood-drops!\n  You human forms with the fathomless ever-impressive countenances of\n      brutes!\n  I dare not refuse you--the scope of the world, and of time and space are\n      upon me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  \"I do not prefer others so very much before you either;\n  I do not say one word against you, away back there, where you stand;\n  (You will come forward in due time to my side.)\n  My spirit has pass'd in compassion and determination around the whole\n      earth;\n  I have look'd for equals and lovers, and found them ready for me in all\n      lands;\n  I think some divine rapport has equalized me with them.\n\n  \"O vapours! I think I have risen with you, and moved away to distant\n      continents and fallen down there, for reasons;\n  I think I have blown with you, O winds;\n  O waters, I have finger'd every shore with you.\n\n  \"I have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run\n      through;\n  I have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas, and on the high\n      embedded rocks, to cry thence.\n\n      \"_Salut au monde!_\n  What cities the light or warmth penetrates, I penetrate those cities\n      myself;\n  All islands to which birds wing their way I wing my way myself.\n\n      \"Toward all,\n  I raise high the perpendicular hand--I make the signal,\n  To remain after me in sight forever,\n  For all the haunts and homes of men.\"\n\nBut \"Hold!\" says the reader, especially if he be one who loves science,\nwho loves to feel the firm ground under his feet, \"That the species has a\ngreat future before it we may well believe; already we see the\nindications. But that the individual has is quite another matter. We can\nbut balance probabilities here, and the probabilities are very heavy on\nthe wrong side; the poets must throw in weighty matter indeed to turn the\nscale the other way!\" Be it so: but ponder a moment what science herself\nhas to say bearing on this theme; what are the widest, deepest facts she\nhas reached down to. INDESTRUCTIBILITY: Amidst ceaseless change and\nseeming decay all the elements, all the forces (if indeed they be not one\nand the same) which operate and substantiate those changes, imperishable;\nneither matter nor force capable of annihilation. Endless transformations,\ndisappearances, new combinations, but diminution of the total amount\nnever; missing in one place or shape to be found in another, disguised\never so long, ready always to re-emerge. \"A particle of oxygen,\" wrote\nFaraday, \"is ever a particle of oxygen; nothing can in the least wear it.\nIf it enters into combination and disappears as oxygen, if it pass through\na thousand combinations, animal, vegetable, mineral--if it lie hid for a\nthousand years and then be evolved, it is oxygen with its first qualities\nneither more nor less.\" So then out of the universe is no door. CONTINUITY\nagain is one of Nature's irrevocable words; everything the result and\noutcome of what went before; no gaps, no jumps; always a connecting\nprinciple which carries forward the great scheme of things as a related\nwhole, which subtly links past and present, like and unlike. Nothing\nbreaks with its past. \"It is not,\" says Helmholtz, \"the definite mass of\nsubstance which now constitutes the body to which the continuance of the\nindividual is attached. Just as the flame remains the same in appearance\nand continues to exist with the same form and structure although it draws\nevery moment fresh combustible vapour and fresh oxygen from the air into\nthe vortex of its ascending current; and just as the wave goes on in\nunaltered form and is yet being reconstructed every moment from fresh\nparticles of water, so is it also in the living being. For the material of\nthe body like that of flame is subject to continuous and comparatively\nrapid change--a change the more rapid the livelier the activity of the\norgans in question. Some constituents are renewed from day to day, some\nfrom month to month, and others only after years. That which continues to\nexist as a particular individual is, like the wave and the flame, only the\n_form of motion_ which continually attracts fresh matter into its vortex\nand expels the old. The observer with a deaf ear recognizes the vibration\nof sound as long as it is visible and can be felt, bound up with other\nheavy matter. Are our senses in reference to life like the deaf ear in\nthis respect?\"\n\n  \"You are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely\n      around yourself;\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and\n      father--it is to identify you;\n  It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided;\n  Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,\n  You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.\n\n  \"O Death! the voyage of Death!\n  The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments for\n      reasons;\n  Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd or reduced to\n      powder or buried.\n  My real body doubtless left me for other spheres,\n  My voided body, nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,\n      farther offices, eternal uses of the earth.\"\n\nYes, they go their way, those dismissed atoms with all their energies and\naffinities unimpaired. But they are not all; the will, the affections, the\nintellect are just as real as those affinities and energies, and there is\nstrict account of all; nothing slips through; there is no door out of the\nuniverse. But they are qualities of a personality, of a self, not of an\natom but of what uses and dismisses those atoms. If the qualities are\nindestructible so must the self be. The little heap of ashes, the puff of\ngas, do you pretend that is all that was Shakespeare? The rest of him\nlives in his works, you say? But he lived and was just the same man after\nthose works were produced. The world gained, but he lost nothing of\nhimself, rather grew and strengthened in the production of them.\n\nStill farther, those faculties with which we seek for knowledge are only a\npart of us, there is something behind which wields them, something that\nthose faculties cannot turn themselves in upon and comprehend; for the\npart cannot compass the whole. Yet there it is with the irrefragable proof\nof consciousness. Who should be the mouthpiece of this whole? Who but the\npoet, the man most fully \"possessed of his own soul,\" the man of the\nlargest consciousness; fullest of love and sympathy which gather into his\nown life the experiences of others, fullest of imagination; that quality\nwhereof Wordsworth says that it\n\n        \"... in truth\n  Is but another name for absolute power,\n  And clearest insight, amplitude of mind\n  And reason in her most exalted mood.\"\n\nLet Walt Whitman speak for us:\n\n  \"And I know I am solid and sound;\n  To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow:\n  All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\n\n  \"I know I am deathless;\n  I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter's compass;\n  I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick\n      at night.\n\n  \"I know I am august;\n  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood;\n  I see that the elementary laws never apologize;\n  (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after\n      all.)\n\n  \"I exist as I am--that is enough;\n  If no other in the world be aware I sit content;\n  And if each one and all be aware, I sit content.\n\n  \"One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;\n  And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million\n      years,\n  I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\n  \"My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;\n  I laugh at what you call dissolution;\n  And I know the amplitude of time.\"\n\nWhat lies through the portal of death is hidden from us; but the laws that\ngovern that unknown land are not all hidden from us, for they govern here\nand now; they are immutable, eternal.\n\n  \"Of and in all these things\n  I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us\n      changed,\n  I have dream'd that heroes and good doers shall be under the present and\n      past law,\n  And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and\n      past law,\n  For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.\"\n\nAnd the law not to be eluded is the law of consequences, the law of silent\nteaching. That is the meaning of disease, pain, remorse. Slow to learn are\nwe; but success is assured with limitless Beneficence as our teacher, with\nlimitless time as our opportunity. Already we begin--\n\n  \"To know the Universe itself as a road--as many roads\n  As roads for travelling souls.\n  For ever alive; for ever forward.\n  Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,\n      dissatisfied;\n  Desperate, proud, fond, sick;\n  Accepted by men, rejected by men.\n  They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go.\n  But I know they go toward the best, toward something great;\n  The whole Universe indicates that it is good.\"\n\nGoing somewhere! And if it is impossible for us to see whither, as in the\nnature of things it must be, how can we be adequate judges of the way? how\ncan we but often grope and be full of perplexity? But we know that a\nsmooth path, a paradise of a world, could only nurture fools, cowards,\nsluggards. \"Joy is the great unfolder,\" but pain is the great enlightener,\nthe great stimulus in certain directions, alike of man and beast. How else\ncould the self-preserving instincts, and all that grows out of them, have\nbeen evoked? How else those wonders of the moral world, fortitude,\npatience, sympathy? And if the lesson be too hard comes Death, come \"the\nsure-enwinding arms of Death\" to end it, and speed us to the unknown land.\n\n      \"... Man is only weak\n  Through his mistrust and want of hope,\"\n\nwrote Wordsworth. But man's mistrust of himself is, at bottom, mistrust of\nthe central Fount of power and goodness whence he has issued. Here comes\none who plucks out of religion its heart of fear, and puts into it a heart\nof boundless faith and joy; a faith that beggars previous faiths because\nit sees that All is good, not part bad and part good; that there is no\nflaw in the scheme of things, no primeval disaster, no counteracting\npower; but orderly and sure growth and development, and that infinite\nGoodness and Wisdom embrace and ever lead forward all that exists. Are you\ntroubled that He is an unknown God; that we cannot by searching find Him\nout? Why, it would be a poor prospect for the Universe if otherwise; if,\nembryos that we are, we could compass Him in our thoughts:\n\n  \"I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the\n      least.\"\n\nIt is the double misfortune of the churches that they do not study God in\nHis works--man and Nature and their relations to each other; and that they\ndo profess to set Him forth; that they worship therefore a God of man's\ndevising, an idol made by men's minds it is true, not by their hands, but\nnone the less an idol. \"Leaves are not more shed out of trees than Bibles\nare shed out of you,\" says the poet. They were the best of their time, but\nnot of all time; they need renewing as surely as there is such a thing as\ngrowth, as surely as knowledge nourishes and sustains to further\ndevelopment; as surely as time unrolls new pages of the mighty scheme of\nexistence. Nobly has George Sand, too, written: \"Everything is divine,\neven matter; everything is superhuman, even man. God is everywhere. He is\nin me in a measure proportioned to the little that I am. My present life\nseparates me from Him just in the degree determined by the actual state of\nchildhood of our race. Let me content myself in all my seeking to feel\nafter Him, and to possess of Him as much as this imperfect soul can take\nin with the intellectual sense I have. The day will come when we shall no\nlonger talk about God idly; nay, when we shall talk about Him as little\nas possible. We shall cease to set Him forth dogmatically, to dispute\nabout His nature. We shall put compulsion on no one to pray to Him, we\nshall leave the whole business of worship within the sanctuary of each\nman's conscience. And this will happen when we are really religious.\"\n\nIn what sense may Walt Whitman be called the Poet of Democracy? It is as\ngiving utterance to this profoundly religious faith in man. He is rather\nthe prophet of what is to be than the celebrator of what is. \"Democracy,\"\nhe writes, \"is a word the real gist of which still sleeps quite\nunawakened, notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests out\nof which its syllables have come from pen or tongue. It is a great word,\nwhose history, I suppose, remains unwritten because that history has yet\nto be enacted. It is in some sort younger brother of another great and\noften used word, Nature, whose history also waits unwritten.\" Political\ndemocracy, now taking shape, is the house to live in, and whilst what we\ndemand of it is room for all, fair chances for all, none disregarded or\nleft out as of no account, the main question, the kind of life that is to\nbe led in that house is altogether beyond the ken of the statesmen as\nsuch, and is involved in those deepest facts of the nature and destiny of\nman which are the themes of Walt Whitman's writings. The practical outcome\nof that exalted and all-accepting faith in the scheme of things, and in\nman, toward whom all has led up and in whom all concentrates as the\nmanifestation, the revelation of Divine Power is a changed estimate of\nhimself; a higher reverence for, a loftier belief in the heritage of\nhimself; a perception that pride, not humility, is the true homage to his\nMaker; that \"noblesse oblige\" is for the Race, not for a handful; that it\nis mankind and womankind and their high destiny which constrain to\ngreatness, which can no longer stoop to meanness and lies and base aims,\nbut must needs clothe themselves in \"the majesty of honest dealing\"\n(majestic because demanding courage as good as the soldier's, self-denial\nas good as the saint's for every-day affairs), and walk erect and\nfearless, a law to themselves, sternest of all lawgivers. Looking back to\nthe palmy days of feudalism, especially as immortalized in Shakespeare's\nplays, what is it we find most admirable? what is it that fascinates? It\nis the noble pride, the lofty self-respect; the dignity, the courage and\naudacity of its great personages. But this pride, this dignity rested half\nupon a true, half upon a hollow foundation; half upon intrinsic qualities,\nhalf upon the ignorance and brutishness of the great masses of the people,\nwhose helpless submission and easily dazzled imaginations made\nstepping-stones to the elevation of the few, and \"hedged round kings,\"\nwith a specious kind of \"divinity.\" But we have our faces turned toward a\nnew day, and toward heights on which there is room for all.\n\n  \"By God, I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart\n      of on the same terms\"\n\nis the motto of the great personages, the great souls of to-day. _On the\nsame terms_, for that is Nature's law and cannot be abrogated, the\nreaping as you sow. But all shall have the chance to sow well. This is\npride indeed! Not a pride that isolates, but that can take no rest till\nour common humanity is lifted out of the mire everywhere, \"a pride that\ncannot stretch too far because sympathy stretches with it\":\n\n  \"Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!\n  These shows of the east and west are tame, compared to you;\n  These immense meadows--these interminable rivers--\n  You are immense and interminable as they;\n  These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of apparent\n      dissolution--you are he or she who is master or mistress over them,\n  Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain,\n      passion, dissolution.\n\n  \"The hopples fall from your ankles--you find an unfailing sufficiency;\n  Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever\n      you are promulges itself;\n  Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is\n      scanted;\n  Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance and ennui, what you are\n      picks its way.\"\n\nThis is indeed a pride that is \"calming and excellent to the soul\"; that\n\"dissolves poverty from its need and riches from its conceit.\"\n\nAnd humility? Is there, then, no place for that virtue so much praised by\nthe haughty? Humility is the sweet spontaneous grace of an aspiring,\nfinely developed nature which sees always heights ahead still unclimbed,\nwhich outstrips itself in eager longing for excellence still unattained.\nGenuine humility takes good care of itself as men rise in the scale of\nbeing; for every height climbed discloses still new heights beyond. Or it\nis a wise caution in fortune's favourites lest they themselves should\nmistake, as the unthinking crowd around do, the glitter reflected back\nupon them by their surroundings for some superiority inherent in\nthemselves. It befits them well if there be also due pride, pride of\nhumanity behind. But to say to a man, 'Be humble' is like saying to one\nwho has a battle to fight, a race to run, 'You are a poor, feeble\ncreature; you are not likely to win and you do not deserve to.' Say rather\nto him, 'Hold up your head! You were not made for failure, you were made\nfor victory: go forward with a joyful confidence in that result sooner or\nlater, and the sooner or the later depends mainly on yourself.'\n\n\"What Christ appeared for in the moral-spiritual field for humankind,\nnamely, that in respect to the absolute soul there is in the possession of\nsuch by each single individual something so transcendent, so incapable of\ngradations (like life) that to that extent it places all being on a common\nlevel, utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect, virtue,\nstation, or any height or lowliness whatever\" is the secret source of that\ndeathless sentiment of Equality which how many able heads imagine\nthemselves to have slain with ridicule and contempt as Johnson, kicking a\nstone, imagined he had demolished Idealism when he had simply attributed\nto the word an impossible meaning. True, _In_equality is one of Nature's\nwords: she moves forward always by means of the exceptional. But the\nmoment the move is accomplished, then all her efforts are toward equality,\ntoward bringing up the rear to that standpoint. But social inequalities,\nclass distinctions, do not stand for or represent Nature's inequalities.\nPrecisely the contrary in the long run. They are devices for holding up\nmany that would else gravitate down and keeping down many who would else\nrise up; for providing that some should reap who have not sown, and many\nsow without reaping. But literature tallies the ways of Nature; for though\nitself the product of the exceptional, its aim is to draw all men up to\nits own level. The great writer is \"hungry for equals day and night,\" for\nso only can he be fully understood. \"The meal is equally set\"; all are\ninvited. Therefore is literature, whether consciously or not, the greatest\nof all forces on the side of Democracy.\n\nCarlyle has said there is no grand poem in the world but is at bottom a\nbiography--the life of a man. Walt Whitman's poems are not the biography\nof a man, but they are his actual presence. It is no vain boast when he\nexclaims,\n\n  \"Camerado! this is no book;\n  Who touches this touches a man.\"\n\nHe has infused himself into words in a way that had not before seemed\npossible; and he causes each reader to feel that he himself or herself has\nan actual relationship to him, is a reality full of inexhaustible\nsignificance and interest to the poet. The power of his book, beyond even\nits great intellectual force, is the power with which he makes this felt;\nhis words lay more hold than the grasp of a hand, strike deeper than the\ngaze or the flash of an eye; to those who comprehend him he stands \"nigher\nthan the nighest.\"\n\nAmerica has had the shaping of Walt Whitman, and he repays the filial debt\nwith a love that knows no stint. Her vast lands with their varied,\nbrilliant climes and rich products, her political scheme, her achievements\nand her failures, all have contributed to make these poems what they are\nboth directly and indirectly. Above all has that great conflict, the\nSecession War, found voice in him. And if the reader would understand the\ntrue causes and nature of that war, ostensibly waged between North and\nSouth, but underneath a tussle for supremacy between the good and the evil\ngenius of America (for there were just as many secret sympathizers with\nthe secession-slave-power in the North as in the South) he will find the\nclue in the pages of Walt Whitman. Rarely has he risen to a loftier height\nthan in the poem which heralds that volcanic upheaval:--\n\n  \"Rise, O days, from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier and fiercer\n      sweep!\n  Long for my soul, hungering gymnastic, I devour'd what the earth gave\n      me;\n  Long I roam'd the woods of the north--long I watch'd Niagara pouring;\n  I travel'd the prairies over, and slept on their breast--\n  I cross'd the Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus;\n  I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea;\n  I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm;\n  I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves;\n  I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over;\n  I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds;\n  Saw from below what arose and mounted (O superb! O wild as my heart,\n      and powerful!)\n  Heard the continuous thunder, as it bellow'd after the lightning;\n  Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning, as sudden and fast\n      amid the din they chased each other across the sky;\n  --These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive\n      and masterful;\n  All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me;\n  Yet there with my soul I fed--I fed content, supercilious.\n\n  \"'Twas well, O soul! 'twas a good preparation you gave me!\n  Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill;\n  Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us;\n  Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities;\n  Something for us is pouring now, more than Niagara pouring;\n  Torrents of men (sources and rills of the Northwest, are you indeed\n      inexhaustible?)\n  What, to pavements and homesteads here--what were those storms of the\n      mountains and sea?\n  What, to passions I witness around me to-day? Was the sea risen?\n  Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?\n  Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage;\n  Manhattan, rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,\n      unchain'd;\n  --What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here!\n  How it climbs with daring feet and hands! how it dashes!\n  How the true thunder bellows after the lightning! how bright the flashes\n      of lightning!\n  How DEMOCRACY, with desperate, vengeful port strides on, shown through\n      the dark by those flashes of lightning!\n  (Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,\n  In a lull of the deafening confusion.)\n\n  \"Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! stride with vengeful stroke!\n  And do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!\n  Crash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good;\n  My soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong\n      nutriment,\n  --Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads, through farms, only\n      half satisfied;\n  One doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground\n      before me,\n  Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing\n      low;\n  --The cities I loved so well, I abandon'd and left--I sped to the\n      certainties suitable to me;\n  Hungering, hungering, hungering for primal energies, and nature's\n      dauntlessness;\n  I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only;\n  I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I\n      waited long;\n  --But now I no longer wait--I am fully satisfied--I am glutted;\n  I have witness'd the true lightning--I have witness'd my cities\n      electric;\n  I have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike America rise;\n  Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,\n  No more on the mountain roam, or sail the stormy sea.\"\n\nBut not for the poet a soldier's career. \"To sit by the wounded and soothe\nthem, or silently watch the dead\" was the part he chose. During the whole\nwar he remained with the army, but only to spend the days and nights,\nsaddest, happiest of his life, in the hospital tents. It was a beautiful\ndestiny for this lover of men, and a proud triumph for this believer in\nthe People; for it was the People that he beheld, tried by severest tests.\nHe saw them \"of their own choice, fighting, dying for their own idea,\ninsolently attacked by the secession-slave-power.\" From the workshop, the\nfarm, the store, the desk, they poured forth, officered by men who had to\nblunder into knowledge at the cost of the wholesale slaughter of their\ntroops. He saw them \"tried long and long by hopelessness, mismanagement,\ndefeat; advancing unhesitatingly through incredible slaughter; sinewy with\nunconquerable resolution. He saw them by tens of thousands in the\nhospitals tried by yet drearier, more fearful tests--the wound, the\namputation, the shattered face, the slow hot fever, the long impatient\nanchorage in bed; he marked their fortitude, decorum, their religious\nnature and sweet affection.\" Finally, newest, most significant sight of\nall, victory achieved, the cause, the Union safe, he saw them return back\nto the workshop, the farm, the desk, the store, instantly reabsorbed into\nthe peaceful industries of the land:--\n\n  \"A pause--the armies wait.\n  A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait.\n  The world, too, waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn\n  They melt, they disappear.\"\n\n\"Plentifully supplied, last-needed proof of Democracy in its\npersonalities!\" ratifying on the broadest scale Wordsworth's haughty claim\nfor average man--\"Such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there\nbelong to it sublimities of virtue which all men may attain, and which no\nman can transcend.\"\n\nBut, aware that peace and prosperity may be even still severer tests of\nnational as of individual virtue and greatness of mind, Walt Whitman scans\nwith anxious, questioning eye the America of to-day. He is no\nsmooth-tongued prophet of easy greatness.\n\n  \"I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue questioning every\n      one I meet;\n  Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?\n  Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?\"\n\nHe sees clearly as any the incredible flippancy, the blind fury of\nparties, the lack of great leaders, the plentiful meanness and vulgarity;\nthe labour question beginning to open like a yawning gulf.... \"We sail a\ndangerous sea of seething currents, all so dark and untried.... It seems\nas if the Almighty had spread before this nation charts of imperial\ndestinies, dazzling as the sun, yet with many a deep intestine difficulty,\nand human aggregate of cankerous imperfection saying lo! the roads! The\nonly plans of development, long and varied, with all terrible balks and\nebullitions! You said in your soul, I will be empire of empires, putting\nthe history of old-world dynasties, conquests, behind me as of no\naccount--making a new history, a history of democracy ... I alone\ninaugurating largeness, culminating time. If these, O lands of America,\nare indeed the prizes, the determinations of your soul, be it so. But\nbehold the cost, and already specimens of the cost. Thought you greatness\nwas to ripen for you like a pear? If you would have greatness, know that\nyou must conquer it through ages ... must pay for it with proportionate\nprice. For you, too, as for all lands, the struggle, the traitor, the wily\nperson in office, scrofulous wealth, the surfeit of prosperity, the\ndemonism of greed, the hell of passion, the decay of faith, the long\npostponement, the fossil-like lethargy, the ceaseless need of revolutions,\nprophets, thunderstorms, deaths, new projections and invigorations of\nideas and men.\"\n\n\"Yet I have dreamed, merged in that hidden-tangled problem of our fate,\nwhose long unravelling stretches mysteriously through time--dreamed,\nportrayed, hinted already--a little or a larger band, a band of brave and\ntrue, unprecedented yet, arm'd and equipt at every point, the members\nseparated, it may be by different dates and states, or south or north, or\neast or west, a year, a century here, and other centuries there, but\nalways one, compact in soul, conscience-conserving, God-inculcating,\ninspired achievers not only in literature, the greatest art, but achievers\nin all art--a new undying order, dynasty from age to age transmitted, a\nband, a class at least as fit to cope with current years, our dangers,\nneeds, as those who, for their time, so long, so well, in armour or in\ncowl, upheld and made illustrious that far-back-feudal, priestly world.\"\n\nOf that band, is not Walt Whitman the pioneer? Of that New World\nliterature, say, are not his poems the beginning? A rude beginning if you\nwill. He claims no more and no less. But whatever else they may lack they\ndo not lack vitality, initiative, sublimity. They do not lack that which\nmakes life great and death, with its \"transfers and promotions, its superb\nvistas,\" exhilarating--a resplendent faith in God and man which will\nkindle anew the faith of the world:--\n\n  \"Poets to come! Orators, singers, musicians to come!\n  Not to-day is to justify me, and answer what I am for;\n  But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before\n      known,\n\n  \"Arouse! Arouse--for you must justify me--you must answer.\n\n  \"I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,\n  I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.\n\n  \"I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a\n      casual look upon you, and then averts his face,\n  Leaving it to you to prove and define it,\n  Expecting the main things from you.\"\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n[Illustration: ANNE GILCHRIST\n\nPhotogravure from a painting by her son, made in 1882]\n\n\n\n\nLETTER I[3]\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO W. M. ROSSETTI AND ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  _Washington,\n  December 9, 1869._\n\nDEAR MR. ROSSETTI:\n\nYour letter of last summer to William O'Connor with the passages\ntranscribed from a lady's correspondence, had been shown me by him, and\ncopy lately furnished me, which I have just been rereading. I am deeply\ntouched by these sympathies and convictions, coming from a woman and from\nEngland, and am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to\nme to get them, she would not only pardon you for transmitting them to Mr.\nO'Connor but approve that action. I realize indeed of this emphatic and\nsmiling _well done_ from the heart and conscience of a true wife and\nmother, and one too whose sense of the poetic, as I glean from your\nletter, after flowing through the heart and conscience, must also move\nthrough and satisfy science as much as the esthetic, that I had hitherto\nreceived no eulogium so magnificent.\n\nI send by same mail with this, same address as this letter, two\nphotographs, taken within a few months. One is intended for the lady (if I\nmay be permitted to send it her)--and will you please accept the other,\nwith my respects and love? The picture is by some criticised very severely\nindeed, but I hope you will not dislike it, for I confess to myself a\nperhaps capricious fondness for it, as my own portrait, over some scores\nthat have been made or taken at one time or another.\n\nI am still employed in the Attorney General's office. My p. o. address\nremains the same. I am quite well and hearty. My new editions,\nconsiderably expanded, with what suggestions &c. I have to offer,\npresented I hope in more definite form, will probably get printed the\ncoming spring. I shall forward you early copies. I send my love to Moncure\nConway, if you see him. I wish he would write to me. If the pictures don't\ncome, or get injured on the way, I will try again by express. I want you\nto loan this letter to the lady, or if she wishes it, give it to her to\nkeep.\n\nWALT WHITMAN.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER II\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n_September 3, 1871._\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nAt last the beloved books have reached my hand--but now I have them, my\nheart is so rent with anguish, my eyes so blinded, I cannot read in them.\nI try again and again, but too great waves come swaying up & suffocate me.\nI will struggle to tell you my story. It seems to me a death struggle.\nWhen I was eighteen I met a lad of nineteen[4] who loved me then, and\nalways for the remainder of his life. After we had known each other about\na year he asked me to be his wife. But I said that I liked him well as my\nfriend, but could not love him as a wife should love & felt deeply\nconvinced I never should. He was not turned aside, but went on just the\nsame as if that conversation had never passed. After a year he asked me\nagain, and I, deeply moved by and grateful for his steady love, and so\nsorry for him, said yes. But next day, terrified at what I had done and\npainfully conscious of the dreary absence from my heart of any faintest\ngleam of true, tender, wifely love,[5] said no again. This too he bore\nwithout desisting & at the end of some months once more asked me with\npassionate entreaties. Then, dear friend, I prayed very earnestly, and it\nseemed to me (that) that I should continue to mar & thwart his life so was\nnot right, if he was content to accept what I could give. I knew I could\nlead a good and wholesome life beside him--his aims were noble--his heart\na deep, beautiful, true Poet's heart; but he had not the Poet's great\nbrain. His path was a very arduous one, and I knew I could smooth it for\nhim--cheer him along it. It seemed to me God's will that I should marry\nhim. So I told him the whole truth, and he said he would rather have me on\nthose terms than not have me at all. He said to me many times, \"Ah, Annie,\nit is not you who are so loved that is rich; it is I who so love.\" And I\nknew this was true, felt as if my nature were poor & barren beside his.\nBut it was not so, it was only slumbering--undeveloped. For, dear Friend,\nmy soul was so passionately aspiring--it so thirsted & pined for light, it\nhad not power to reach alone and he could not help me on my way. And a\nwoman is so made that she cannot give the tender passionate devotion of\nher whole nature save to the great conquering soul, stronger in its\npowers, though not in its aspirations, than her own, that can lead her\nforever & forever up and on. It is for her soul exactly as it is for her\nbody. The strong divine soul of the man embracing hers with passionate\nlove--so alone the precious germs within her soul can be quickened into\nlife. And the time will come when man will understand that a woman's soul\nis as dear and needful to his and as different from his as her body to his\nbody. This was what happened to me when I had read for a few days, nay,\nhours, in your books. It was the divine soul embracing mine. I never\nbefore dreamed what love meant: not what life meant. Never was alive\nbefore--no words but those of \"new birth\" can hint the meaning of what\nthen happened to me.\n\nThe first few months of my marriage were dark and gloomy to me within, and\nsometimes I had misgivings whether I had judged aright, but when I knew\nthere was a dear baby coming my heart grew light, and when it was born,\nsuch a superb child--all gloom & fear forever vanished. I knew it was\nGod's seal to the marriage, and my heart was full of gratitude and joy. It\nwas a happy and a good life we led together for ten short years, he ever\ntender and affectionate to me--loving his children so, working earnestly\nin the wholesome, bracing atmosphere of poverty--for it was but just\npossible with the most strenuous frugality and industry to pay our way. I\nlearned to cook & to turn my hand to all household occupation--found it\nbracing, healthful, cheerful. Now I think it more even now that I\nunderstand the divineness & sacredness of the Body. I think there is no\nmore beautiful task for a woman than ministering all ways to the health &\ncomfort & enjoyment of the dear bodies of those she loves: no material\nthat will work sweeter, more beautifully into that making of a perfect\npoem of a man's life which is her true vocation.\n\nIn 1861 my children took scarlet fever badly: I thought I should have lost\nmy dear oldest girl. Then my husband took it--and in five days it carried\nhim from me. I think, dear friend, my sorrow was far more bitter, though\nnot so deep, as that of a loving tender wife. As I stood by him in the\ncoffin I felt such remorse I had not, could not have, been more tender to\nhim--such a conviction that if I had loved him as he deserved to be loved\nhe would not have been taken from us. To the last my soul dwelt apart &\nunmated & his soul dwelt apart unmated. I do not fear the look of his dear\nsilent eyes. I do not think he would even be grieved with me now. My\nyoungest was then a baby. I have had much sweet tranquil happiness, much\nstrenuous work and endeavour raising my darlings.\n\nIn May, 1869, came the voice over the Atlantic to me--O, the voice of my\nMate: it must be so--my love rises up out of the very depths of the grief\n& tramples upon despair. I can wait--any time, a lifetime, many\nlifetimes--I can suffer, I can dare, I can learn, grow, toil, but nothing\nin life or death can tear out of my heart the passionate belief that one\nday I shall hear that voice say to me, \"My Mate. The one I so much want.\nBride, Wife, indissoluble eternal!\" It is not happiness I plead with God\nfor--it is the very life of my Soul, my love is its life. Dear Walt. It is\na sweet & precious thing, this love; it clings so close, so close to the\nSoul and Body, all so tenderly dear, so beautiful, so sacred; it yearns\nwith such passion to soothe and comfort & fill thee with sweet tender joy;\nit aspires as grandly as gloriously as thy own soul. Strong to soar--soft\n& tender to nestle and caress. If God were to say to me, \"See--he that you\nlove you shall not be given to in this life--he is going to set sail on\nthe unknown sea--will you go with him?\" never yet has bride sprung into\nher husband's arms with the joy with which I would take thy hand & spring\nfrom the shore.\n\nUnderstand aright, dear love, the reason of my silence. I was obeying the\nvoice of conscience. I thought I was to wait. For it is the instinct of a\nwoman's nature to wait to be sought--not to seek. And when that May & June\nI was longing so irrepressibly to write I resolutely restrained myself,\nbelieving if I were only patient the right opening would occur. And so it\ndid through Rossetti. And when he, liking what I said, suggested my\nprinting something, it met and enabled me to carry into execution what I\nwas brooding over. For I had, and still have, a strong conviction that it\nwas necessary for a woman to speak--that finally and decisively only a\nwoman can judge a man, only a man a woman, on the subject of their\nrelations. What is blameless, what is good in its effect on her, is\ngood--however it may have seemed to men. She is the test. And I never for\na moment feared any hard words against myself because I know these things\nare not judged by the intellect but by the unerring instincts of the soul.\nI knew any man could not but feel that it would be a happy and ennobling\nthing for him that his wife should think & feel as I do on that\nsubject--knew that what had filled me with such great and beautiful\nthoughts towards men in that writing could not fail to give them good &\nhappy thoughts towards women in the reading. The cause of my consenting to\nRossetti's[6] urgent advice that I should not put my name, he so kindly\nsolicitous, yet not altogether understanding me & it aright, was that I\ndid not rightly understand how it might be with my dear Boy if it came\nbefore him. I thought perhaps he was not old enough to judge and\nunderstand me aright; nor young enough to let it altogether alone. But it\nhas been very bitter & hateful to me this not standing to what I have said\nas it were, with my own personality, better because of my utter love and\nfaithfulness to the cause & longing to stand openly and proudly in the\nranks of its friends; & for the lower reason that my nature is proud and\nas defiant as thine own and immeasurably disdains any faintest appearance\nof being afraid of what I had done.\n\nAnd, my darling, above all because I love thee so tenderly that if hateful\nwords had been spoken against me I could have taken joy in it for thy dear\nsake. There never yet was the woman who loved that would not joyfully bare\nher breast to wrest the blows aimed at her beloved.\n\nI know not what fiend made me write those meaningless words in my letter,\n\"it is pleasantest to me\" &c., but it was not fear or faithlessness--& it\nis not pleasantest but hateful to me. Now let me come to beautiful joyous\nthings again. O dear Walt, did you not feel in every word the breath of a\nwoman's love? did you not see as through a transparent veil a soul all\nradiant and trembling with love stretching out its arms towards you? I\nwas so sure you would speak, would send me some sign: that I was to\nwait--wait. So I fed my heart with sweet hopes: strengthened it with\nlooking into the eyes of thy picture. O surely in the ineffable tenderness\nof thy look speaks the yearning of thy man-soul towards my woman-soul? But\nnow I will wait no longer. A higher instinct dominates that other, the\ninstinct for perfect truth. I would if I could lay every thought and\naction and feeling of my whole life open to thee as it lies to the eye of\nGod. But that cannot be all at once. O come. Come, my darling: look into\nthese eyes and see the loving ardent aspiring soul in them. Easily, easily\nwill you learn to love all the rest of me for the sake of that and take me\nto your breasts for ever and ever. Out of its great anguish my love has\nrisen stronger, more triumphant than ever: it cannot doubt, cannot fear,\nis strong, divine, immortal, sure of its fruition this side the grave or\nthe other. \"O agonistic throes,\" tender, passionate yearnings, pinings,\ntriumphant joys, sweet dreams--I took from you all. But, dear love, the\nsinews of a woman's outer heart are not twisted so strong as a man's: but\nthe heart within is strong & great & loving. So the strain is very\nterrible. O heart of flesh, hold on yet a few years to the great heart\nwithin thee, if it may be. But if not all is assured, all is safe.\n\nThis time last year when I seemed dying I could have no secrets between me\n& my dear children. I told them of my love: told them all they could\nrightly understand, and laid upon them my earnest injunction that as soon\nas my mother's life no longer held them here, they should go fearlessly to\nAmerica, as I should have planted them down there--Land of Promise, my\nCanaan, to which my soul sings, \"Arise, shine, for thy light is come & the\nglory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" After the 29th of this month I\nshall be in my own home; dear friend--it is at Brookebank, Haslemere,\nSurrey. Haslemere is on the main line between Portsmouth & London.\n\n  Good-bye, dear Walt,\n  ANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n_Sept. 6._\n\nThe new portrait also is a sweet joy & comfort to my longing, pining heart\n& eyes. How have I brooded & brooded with thankfulness on that one word in\nthy letter[7] \"the comfort it has been to me to get her words,\" for always\nday & night these two years has hovered on my lips & in my heart the one\nprayer: \"Dear God, let me comfort him!\" Let me comfort thee with my whole\nbeing, dear love. I feel much better & stronger now.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER III\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Brookebank, Shotter Mill\n  Haslemere, Surrey\n  October 23, 1871._\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nI wrote you a letter the 6th September & would fain know whether it has\nreached your hand. If it have not, I will write its contents again quickly\nto you--if it have, I will wait your time with courage with patience for\nan answer; but spare me the needless suffering of uncertainty on this\npoint & let me have one line, one word, of assurance that I am no longer\nhidden from you by a thick cloud--I from thee--not thou from me: for I\nthat have never set eyes upon thee, all the Atlantic flowing between us,\nyet cleave closer than those that stand nearest & dearest around\nthee--love thee day & night:--last thoughts, first thoughts, my soul's\npassionate yearning toward thy divine Soul, every hour, every deed and\nthought--my love for my children, my hopes, aspirations for them, all\ntaking new shape, new height through this great love. My Soul has staked\nall upon it. In dull dark moods when I cannot, as it were, see thee,\nstill, still always a dumb, blind yearning towards thee--still it comforts\nme to touch, to press to me the beloved books--like a child holding some\nhand in the dark--it knows not whose--but knows it is enough--knows it is\na dear, strong, comforting hand. Do not say I am forward, or that I lack\npride because I tell this love to thee who have never sought or made sign\nof desiring to seek me. Oh, for all that, this love is my pride my glory.\nSource of sufferings and joys that cannot put themselves into words.\nBesides, it is not true thou hast not sought or loved me. For when I read\nthe divine poems I feel all folded round in thy love: I feel often as if\nthou wast pleading so passionately for the love of the woman that can\nunderstand thee--that I know not how to bear the yearning answering\ntenderness that fills my breast. I know that a woman may without hurt to\nher pride--without stain or blame--tell her love to thee. I feel for a\ncertainty that she may. Try me for this life, my darling--see if I cannot\nso live, so grow, so learn, so love, that when I die you will say, \"This\nwoman has grown to be a very part of me. My soul must have her loving\ncompanionship everywhere & in all things. I alone & she alone are not\ncomplete identities--it is I and she together in a new, divine, perfect\nunion that form the one complete identity.\"\n\nI am yet young enough to bear thee children, my darling, if God should so\nbless me. And would yield my life for this cause with serene joy if it\nwere so appointed, if that were the price for thy having a \"perfect\nchild\"--knowing my darlings would all be safe & happy in thy loving\ncare--planted down in America.\n\nLet me have a few words directly, dear Friend. I shall get them by the\nmiddle of November. I shall have to go to London about then or a little\nlater--to find a house for us--I only came to the old home here from which\nI have been absent most four years to wind up matters and prepare for a\nmove, for there is nothing to be had in the way of educational advantages\nhere--it has been a beautiful survey for the children, but it is not what\nthey want now. But we leave with regret, for it is one of the sweetest,\nwildest spots in England, though only 40 miles from London.\n\n  Good-bye, dear friend,\n  ANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IV[8]\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  _Washington, D. C.\n  November 3, 1871._\n\n(TO A. G., EARL'S COLNE, HALSTED, ESSEX, ENG.)\n\nI have been waiting quite a while for time and the right mood, to answer\nyour letter in a spirit as serious as its own, and in the same unmitigated\ntrust and affection. But more daily work than ever has fallen to me to do\nthe present season, and though I am well and contented, my best moods seem\nto shun me. I wish to give to it a day, a sort of Sabbath, or holy day,\napart to itself, under serene and propitious influences, confident that I\ncould then write you a letter which would do you good, and me too. But I\nmust at least show without further delay that I am not insensible to your\nlove. I too send you my love. And do you feel no disappointment because I\nnow write so briefly. My book is my best letter, my response, my truest\nexplanation of all. In it I have put my body and spirit. You understand\nthis better and fuller and clearer than any one else. And I too fully and\nclearly understand the loving letter it has evoked. Enough that there\nsurely exists so beautiful and a delicate relation, accepted by both of us\nwith joy.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER V\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n_27 November '71._\n\nDEAR FRIEND.\n\nYour long waited for letter brought me both joy & pain; but the pain was\nnot of your giving. I gather from it that a long letter[9] which I wrote\nyou Sept. 6th after I had received the precious packet, a letter in which\nI opened all my heart to you, never reached your hands: nor yet a shorter\none[10] which, tortured by anxiety & suspense about its predecessor, I\nwrote Oct. 15, it, too, written out of such stress & intensity of painful\nemotion as wrenches from us inmost truth. I cannot face the thought of\nthese words of uttermost trust & love having fallen into other hands. Can\nboth be simply lost? Could any man suffer a base curiosity, to make him so\nmeanly, treacherously cruel? It seems to cut and then burn me.\n\nI was not disappointed at the shortness of your letter & I do not ask nor\neven wish you to write save when you are inwardly impelled & desirous of\ndoing so. I only want leave and security to write freely to you. Your book\ndoes indeed say all--book that is not a book, for the first time a man\ncomplete, godlike, august, standing revealed the only way possible,\nthrough the garment of speech. Do you know, dear Friend, what it means for\na woman, what it means for me, to understand these poems? It means for her\nwhole nature to be then first kindled; quickened into life through such\nlove, such sympathy, such resistless attraction, that thenceforth she\ncannot choose but live & die striving to become worthy to share this\ndivine man's life--to be his dear companion, closer, nearer, dearer than\nany man can be--for ever so. Her soul stakes all on this. It is the\nmeaning, the fulfilment, the only perfect development & consummation of\nher nature--of her passionate, high, immortal aspirations--her Soul to\nmate with his for ever & ever. O I know the terms are obdurate--I know how\nhard to attain to this greatness, the grandest lot ever aspired to by\nwoman. I know too my own shortcomings, faults, flaws. You might not be\nable to give me your great love yet--to take me to your breast with joy.\nBut I can wait. I can grow great & beautiful through sorrow & suffering,\nworking, struggling, yearning, loving so, all alone, as I have done now\nnearly three years--it will be three in May since I first read the book,\nfirst knew what the word _love_ meant. Love & Hope are so strong in me, my\nsoul's high aspirations are of such tenacious, passionate intensity, are\nso conscious of their own deathless reality, that what would starve them\nout of any other woman only makes them strike out deeper roots, grow more\nresolute & sturdy, in me. I know that \"greatness will not ripen for me\nlike a pear.\" But I could face, I could joyfully accept, the fiercest\nanguish, the hardest toil, the longest, sternest probation, to make me fit\nto be your mate--so that at the last you should say, \"This is the woman I\nhave waited for, the woman prepared for me: this is my dear eternal\ncomrade, wife--the one I so much want.\" Life has no other meaning for me\nthan that--all things have led up to help prepare me for that. Death is\nmore welcome to me than life if it means that--if thou, dear sailor, thou\nsailing upon thy endless cruise, takest me on board--me, daring, all with\nthee, steering for the deep waters, bound where mariner has not yet dared\nto go: hand in hand with thee, nestled close--one with thee. Ah, that word\n\"enough\" was like a blow on the breast to me--breast that often & often is\nso full of yearning tenderness I know not how to draw my breath. The tie\nbetween us would not grow less but more beautiful, dear friend, if you\nknew me _better_: if I could stand as real & near to you as you do to me.\nBut I cannot, like you, clothe my nature in divine poems & so make it\nvisible to you. Ah, foolish me! I thought you would catch a glimpse of it\nin those words I wrote--I thought you would say to yourself, \"Perhaps this\nis the voice of my mate,\" and would seek me a little to make sure if it\nwere so or not. O the sweet dreams I have fed on these three years nearly,\npervading my waking moments, influencing every thought & action. I was so\nsure, so sure if I waited silently, patiently, you would send me some\nsign: so full of joyful hope I could not doubt nor fear. When I lay dying\nas it seemed, [I was] still full of the radiant certainty that you would\nseek me, would not lose [me], that we should as surely find one another\nthere as here. And when the ebb ceased & life began to flow back into me,\nO never doubting but it was for you. Never doubting but that the sweetest,\nnoblest, closest, tenderest companionship ever yet tasted by man & woman\nwas to begin for us here & now. Then came the long, long waiting, the hope\ndeferred: each morning so sure the book would come & with it a word from\nyou that should give me leave to speak: no longer to shut down in stern\nsilence the love, the yearning, the thoughts that seemed to strain & crush\nmy heart. I knew what that means--\"if thou wast not gifted to sing thou\nwouldst surely die.\" I felt as if my silence must kill me sometimes. Then\nwhen the Book came but with it no word for me alone, there was such a\nstorm in [my] heart I could not for weeks read in it. I wrote that long\nletter out in the Autumn fields for dear life's sake. I knew I might, and\nmust, speak then. Then I felt relieved, joyful, buoyant once more. Then\nagain months of heart-wearying disappointment as I looked in vain for a\nletter-O the anguish at times, the scalding tears, the feeling within as\nif my heart were crushed & doubled up--but always afterwards saying to\nmyself \"If this suffering is to make my love which was born & grew up &\nblossomed all in a moment strike deep root down in the dark & cold,\npenetrate with painful intensity every fibre of my being, make it a love\nsuch as he himself is capable of giving, then welcome this anguish, these\nbitter deferments: let its roots be watered as long as God pleases with my\ntears.\"\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n  _50 Marquis Road\n  London\n  Camden Sqr. N. W._\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Road, Camden Sqre.\n  London, N. W.,\n  January 24, '72._\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nI send you photographs of my oldest and youngest children, I wish I had\nsome worth sending of the other two. That of myself done in 1850 is a copy\nof a daguerrotype. The recent one was taken just a week or so before I\nbroke down in my long illness & when I was struggling against a terrible\nsense of inward prostration; so it has not my natural expression, but I\nthink you will like to have [it] rather than none, & the weather here is\ntoo gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one if I were to try\nagain. Your few words lifted a heavy weight off me. Very few they are,\ndear friend: but knowing that I may give to every word you speak its\nfullest, truest meaning, the more I brood over them the sweeter do they\ntaste. Still I am not as happy & content as I thought I should be if I\ncould only know my words reached you & were welcome to you,--but restless,\nanxious, impatient, looking so wistfully towards the letters each\nmorning--above all, longing, longing so for you to come--to come & see if\nyou feel happy beside me: no more this painful struggle to put myself into\nwords, but to let what I am & all my life speak to you. Only so can you\njudge whether I am indeed the woman capable of rising to the full height\nof great destiny, of justifying & fulfilling your grand thoughts of\nwomen. And see my faults, flaws, shortcomings too, dear Friend. I feel an\nearnest wish you should do this too that there may be the broad unmovable\nfoundation-rock of perfect truth and candour for our love. I do not fear.\nI believe in a large all-accepting, because all-comprehending, love, a\nboundless faith in growth & development--in your judging \"not as the judge\njudges but as the sunshine falling around me.\" To have you in the midst of\nus! we clustered round you, shone upon, vivified, strengthened by your\npresence, surrounding you with an atmosphere of love & cheerful life.\n\nWhen I wrote to you in Nov. I was in lodgings in London, having just\naccomplished the difficult task of finding a house for us in London, where\nrents are so high. And I have succeeded better than I anticipated, for we\nfind this a comfortable, dear, little home--small, indeed, but not so\nsmall as to interfere with health or comfort, and at rent that I may\nsafely undertake. My Husband was taken from us too young to be able to\nhave made any provision for his children. I have a little of my own--about\nL80 a year; & for the rest depend upon my Mother, whose only surviving\nchild I am. And she, by nature generous & self-denying as well as prudent,\nhas never made anything but a pleasure of this & as long as she was able\nto see to her own affairs, was such a capital manager that she used to\nspare me about L150 out of an income of L350. But now though she retains\nher faculties in a wonderful degree for her years (just upon 86), she is\nno longer able to do this & has put the management of the whole into my\nhands. And I, feeling that she needs, and ought to have, now an easier\nscale of expenditure at Colne, have to manage a little more cleverly still\nto make a less sum serve for us. But I succeed capitally, dear friend--do\nnot want a better home, never get behind hand & find it no hardship, but\nquite the contrary to have to spend a good deal of time & pains in\ndomestic management. And then, just to help me through at the right\nmoment, dear Percy[11] obtained in November a good opening in some large\ncopper & iron mining & smelting works in South Wales at a salary upon\nwhich he can comfortably live; & he likes his work well--writes very\ncheerfully--lodges in a farmhouse in the midst of grand scenery, within a\nwalk of the sea. So this enables me to give the girls a turn in education,\nfor hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine. And I chose this\npart because there is a capital day school for them handy. And Herby[12]\nwalks in to the best drawing school in London & is very diligent and happy\nat his work. His bent is unmistakably strong. It was well I have had to be\nso busy this autumn & winter, dear Walt, for I suffered keenly, sometimes\noverwhelmingly, through the delay in my letters' reaching you. What caused\nit? And when did you get the Sept. & Oct. letters & did you get the two\ncopies that I, baffled & almost despairing, sent off in Nov.? Good-bye,\ndear Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VII[13]\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  _(Washington, D. C.)\n  Feb. 8 '72._\n\nI send by same mail with this my latest piece copied in a newspaper--and\nwrite you just a line. I suppose you only received my former letters\n(two)--I ought to have written something about your children (described to\nme in your letter of last summer--[July 23d] which I have just been\nreading again.) Dear boys and girls--how my heart goes out to them.\n\nDid I tell you that I had received letters from Tennyson, and that he\ncordially invites me to visit him? Sometimes I dream of coming to Old\nEngland, on such visit.--& thus of seeing you & your children----But it is\na dream only.\n\nI am still living here in employment in a Government office. My health is\ngood. Life is rather sluggish here--yet not without the sunshine. Your\nletters too were bright rays of it. I am going on to New York soon, to\nstay a few weeks, but my address will still be here. I wrote lately to Mr.\nRossetti quite a long letter. Dear friend, best love & remembrance to you\n& to the young folk.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq. N. W.\n  April 12th, '72._\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nI was to tell you about my acquaintanceship with Tennyson, which was a\npleasant episode in my life at Haslemere. Hearing of the extreme beauty of\nthe scenery thereabouts & specially of its comparative wildness &\nseclusion, he thought he would like to find or build a house, to escape\nfrom the obtrusive curiosity of the multitudes who flock to the Isle of\nWight at certain seasons of the year. He is even morbidly sensitive on\nthis point & will not stir beyond his own grounds from week's end to\nweek's end to avoid his admiring or inquisitive persecutors. So, knowing\nan old friend of mine, he called on me for particulars as to the resources\nof the neighbourhood. And I, a good walker & familiar with every least\nfrequent spot of hill & dale for some miles round, took him long ambles in\nquest of a site. Very pleasant rambles they were; Tennyson, under the\ninfluence of the fresh, outdoor, quite unconstrained life in new scenery &\nwith a cheerful aim, shaking off the languid ennuye air, as of a man to\nwhom nothing has any longer a relish--bodily or mental--that too often\nhangs about him. And we found something quite to his mind--a coppice of 40\nacres hanging on the south side two thirds of the way up a hill some 1000\nft. high so as to be sheltered from the cold & yet have the light, dry,\nelastic hill air--& with, of course, a glorious outlook over the wooded\nweald of Sussex so richly green & fertile & looking almost as boundless as\nthe great sweep of sky over it--the South Downs to Surrey Hills & near at\nhand the hill curving round a fir-covered promontory, standing out very\nblack & grand between him & the sunset. Underfoot too a wilderness of\nbeauty--fox gloves (I wonder if they grow in America) ferns, purple heath\n&c &c. I don't suppose I shall see much more of him now I have left\nHaslemere, though I have had very friendly invitations; for I am a home\nbird--don't like staying out--wanted at home and happiest there. And I\nshould not enjoy being with them in the grand mansion half so much as I\ndid pic-nicing in the road & watching the builders as we did. It is\npleasant to see T--with children--little girls at least--he does not take\nto boys but one of my girls was mostly on his knee when they were in the\nroom & he liked them very much. His two sons are now both 6 ft. high. I\nhave received your letters of March 20 from Brooklyn: but the one you\nspeak of as having acknowledged the photograph never came to hand--a sore\ndisappointment to me, dear Friend. I can ill afford to lose the long &\neagerly watched for pleasure of a letter. If it seems to you there must\nneeds be something unreal, illusive, in a love that has grown up entirely\nwithout the basis of personal intercourse, dear Friend, then you do not\nyourself realize your own power nor understand the full meaning of your\nown words, \"whoso touches this, touches a man\"--\"I have put my Soul & Body\ninto these Poems.\" Real effects imply real causes. Do you suppose that an\nideal figure conjured up by her own fancy could, in a perfectly sound,\nhealthy woman of my age, so happy in her children, so busy & content,\npractical, earnest, produce such real & tremendous effect--saturating her\nwhole life, colouring every waking moment--filling her with such joys,\nsuch pains that the strain of them has been well nigh too much even for a\nstrong frame, coming as it does, after twenty years of hard work?\n\nTherefore please, dear Friend, do not \"warn\" me any more--it hurts so, as\nseeming to distrust my love. Time only can show how needlessly. My love,\nflowing ever fresh & fresh out of my heart, will go with you in all your\nwanderings, dear Friend, enfolding you day and night, soul & body, with\ntenderness that tries so vainly to utter itself in these poor, helpless\nwords, that clings closer than any man's love can cling. O, I could not\nlive if I did not believe that sooner or later you will not be able to\nhelp stretching out your arms towards me & saying \"Come, my Darling.\" When\nyou get this will you post me an American newspaper (any one you have done\nwith) as a token it has reached you--& so on at intervals during your\nwanderings; it will serve as a token that you are well, & the postmark\nwill tell me where you are. And thus you will feel free only to write when\nyou have leisure & inclination--& I shall be spared [the] feeling I have\nwhen I fancy my letters have not reached you--as if I were so hopelessly,\nhelplessly cut off from you, which is more than I can stand. We all read\nAmerican news eagerly too. The children are so well & working on with all\ntheir might. The school turns out more what I desire for them than I had\nventured to hope. Good-bye, dearest Friend.\n\nANN GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden, Sqre.\n  June 3d, 1872._\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nThe newspapers have both come to hand & been gladly welcomed. I shall\nrealize you on the 26th sending living impulses into those young men, with\nresults not to cease--their kindled hearts sending back response through\nglowing eyes that will be warmer to you than the June sunshine. Perhaps,\ntoo, you will have pleasant talks with the eminent astronomers there.\nProf. Young, who is so skilful a worker with that most subtle of tidings\nfrom the stars, the spectroscope--always, it seems hitherto bringing word\nof the \"vast similitude that interlocks all,\" nay, of the absolute\nidentity of the stuff they are made of with the stuff we are made of. The\nnews from Dartmouth that too, is a great pleasure.\n\nIt has been what seems to me a very long while since last writing, because\nit has been a troubled time within & what I wrote I tore up again,\nbelieving it was best, wisest so. You said in your first letter that if\nyou had leisure you could write one that \"would do me good & you too\";\nwrite that letter dear Friend after you have been to Dartmouth[14]--for I\nsorely need it. Perhaps the letters that I have sent you since that first,\nhave given you a feeling of constraint towards me because you cannot\nrespond to them. I will not write any more such letters; or, if I write\nthem because my heart is so full it cannot bear it, they shall not find\ntheir way to the Post. But do not, because I give you more than\nfriendship, think that it would not be a very dear & happy thing to me to\nhave friendship only from you. I do not want you to write what it is any\neffort to write--do not ask for deep thoughts, deep feelings--know well\nthose must choose their own time & mode--but for the simplest current\ndetails--for any thing that helps my eyes to pierce the distance & see you\nas you live & move to-day. I dearly like to hear about your Mother--want\nto know if all your sisters are married, & if you have plenty of little\nnephews & nieces--I like to hear anything about Mr. O'Connor[15] & Mr.\nBurroughs,[16] towards both of whom I feel as toward friends. (Has Mr.\nO'Connor succeeded in getting practically adopted his new method of making\ncast steel? Percy[17] being a worker in the field of metallurgy makes me\nspecially glad to hear about this.) Then, I need not tell you how deep an\ninterest I feel in American politics & want to know if you are satisfied\nwith the result of the Cincinnati Convention & what of Mr. Greely?[18] &\nwhat you augur as to his success--I am sure dear friend, if you realize\nthe joy it is to me to receive a few words from you--about anything that\nis passing in your thoughts & around--how beaming bright & happy the day a\nletter comes & many days after--how light hearted & alert I set about my\ndaily tasks, it would not seem irksome to you to write. And if you say,\n\"Read my books, & be content--you have me in them,\" I say, it is because I\nread them so that I am not content. It is an effort to me to turn to any\nother reading; as to highest literature what I felt three years ago is\nmore than ever true now, with all their precious augmentations. I want\nnothing else--am fully fed & satisfied there. I sit alone many hours busy\nwith my needle; this used to be tedious; but it is not so now--for always\nclose at hand lie the books that are so dear, so dear, I brooding over the\npoems, sunning myself in them, pondering the vistas--all the experience of\nmy past life & all its aspirations corroborating them--all my future & so\nfar as in me lies the future of my children to be shaped modified\nvitalized by & through these--outwardly & inwardly. How can I be content\nto live wholly isolated from you? I am sure it is not possible for any\none,--man or woman, it does not matter which, to receive these books, not\nmerely with the intellect critically admiring their power & beauty, but\nwith an understanding responsive heart, without feeling it drawn out of\ntheir breasts so that they must leave all & come to be with you sometimes\nwithout a resistless yearning for personal intercourse that will take no\ndenial. When we come to America I shall not want you to talk to me, shall\nnot be any way importunate. To settle down where there are some that love\nyou & understand your poems, somewhere that you would be sure to come\npretty often--to have you sit with me while I worked, you silent, or\nreading to yourself, I don't mind how: to let my children grow fond of\nyou--to take food with us; if my music pleased you, to let me play & sing\nto you of an evening. Do your needlework for you--talk freely of all that\noccupied my thoughts concerning the children's welfare &c--I could be very\nhappy so. But silence with the living presence and silence with all the\nocean in between are two different things. Therefore, these years stretch\nout your hand cordially, trustfully, that I may feel its warm grasp.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER X\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq. London\n  July 14, '72._\n\nThe 3d July was my rejoicing day, dearest Friend,--the day the packet from\nAmerica reached me, scattering for a while the clouds of pain and\nhumiliation & filling me through & through with light & warmth; indeed I\nbelieve I am often as happy reading, as you were writing, your Poems. The\nlong new one \"As a Strong Bird\" of itself answers the question hinted in\nyour preface & nobly fulfils the promise of its opening lines. We want\nagain & again in fresh words & from the new impetus & standpoint of new\ndays the vision that sweeps ahead, the tones that fill us with faith & joy\nin our present share of life & work--prophetic of the splendid issues. It\ndoes not need to be American born to believe & passionately rejoice in the\nbelief of what is preparing in America. It is for humanity. And it comes\nthrough England. The noblest souls the most heroic hearts of England were\ncalled to be the nucleus of the race that (enriched with the blood &\nqualities of other races & planted down in the new half of the world\nreserved in all its fresh beauty & exhaustless riches to be the arena) is\nto fulfil, justify, outstrip the vision of the poets, the quenchless\naspirations of all the ardent souls that have ever struggled forward upon\nthis earth. For me, the most precious page in the book is that which\ncontains the Democratic Souvenirs. I respond to that as one to whom it\nmeans the life of her Soul. It comforts me very much. You speak in the\nPreface of the imperious & resistless command from within out of which\n\"Leaves of Grass\" issued. This carried with it no doubt the secret of a\ncorresponding resistless power over the reader wholly unprecedented,\nunapproached in literature, as I believe, & to be compared only with that\nof Christ. I speak out of my own experience when I say that no myth, no\n\"miracle\" embodying the notion of a direct communication between God & a\nhuman creature, goes beyond the effect, soul & body, of those Poems on me:\n& that were I to put into Oriental forms of speech what I experienced it\nwould read like one of those old \"miracles\" or myths. Thus of many things\nthat used to appear to me incomprehensible lies, I now perceive the germ\nof truth & understand that what was called the supernatural was merely an\ninadequate & too timid way of conceiving the natural. Had I died the\nfollowing year, it would have been the simple truth to say I died of joy.\nThe doctor called it nervous exhaustion falling with tremendous violence\non the heart which \"seemed to have been strained\": & was much puzzled how\nthat could have come to pass. I left him in his puzzle--but it was none to\nme. How could such a dazzling radiance of light flooding the soul,\nsuddenly, kindling it to such intense life, but put a tremendous strain on\nthe vital organs? how could the muscles of the heart suddenly grow\nadequate to such new work? O the passionate tender gratitude that flooded\nmy breast, the yearnings that seemed to strain the heart beyond endurance\nthat I might repay with all my life & soul & body this debt--that I might\ngive joy to him who filled me with such joy, that I might make his outward\nlife sweeter & more beautiful who made my inner life so divinely sweet &\nbeautiful. But, dear friend, I have certainly to see that this is not to\nbe so, now: that for me too love & death are folded inseparably together:\nDeath that will renew my youth.\n\nI have had the paper from Burlington[19]--with the details a woman likes\nso to have. I wish I had known for certain whether you went on to Boston &\nwere enjoying the music there. My youngest boy has gone to spend his\nholiday with his brother in South Wales & he writes me such good news of\nPer., that he is \"looking as brown as a nut & very jolly\"; his home in a\n\"clean airy old farm house half way up a mountain in the midst of wild\nrough grand scenery, sea in sight near enough to hear the sound of it\nabout as loud as the rustling of leaves\"--so the boys will have a good\ntime together, and the girls are going with me for the holiday to their\ngrandmother at Colne. W. Rossetti does not take his till October this\nyear. I suppose it will be long & long before this letter reaches you as\nyou will be gone to California--may it be a time full of enjoyment--full\nto the brim.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend,\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nWhat a noble achievement is Mr. Stanley's:[20] it fills me with pleasure\nthat Americans should thus have been the rescuer of our large-hearted,\nheroic traveller. We have just got his letters with account of the five\nraces in Central Africa copied from N. Y. _Herald_, July 29.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Road\n  Camden Sqre.\n  Novr. 12, 1872._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI must write not because I have anything to tell you--but because I want\nso, by help of a few loving words, to come into your presence as it\nwere--into your remembrance. Not more do the things that grow want the\nsun.\n\nI have received all the papers--& each has made a day very bright for me.\n\nI hope the trip to California has not again had to be postponed--I realize\nwell the enjoyment of it, & what it would be to California & the fresh\nimpulses of thought & emotion that would shape themselves, melodiously,\nout of that for the new volume.\n\nMy children are all well. Beatrice is working hard to get through the\nrequisite amount of Latin, &c. that is required in the preliminary\nexamination--before entering on medical studies. Percy, my eldest, whom I\nhave not seen for a year, is coming to spend Xmas with us.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Road\n  Camden Sq. London\n  Jan. 31, '73._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nShall you never find it in your heart to say a kind word to me again? or a\nword of some sort? Surely I must have written what displeased you very\nmuch that you should turn away from me as the tone of your last letter &\nthe ten months' silence which have followed seem to express to me with\nsuch emphasis. But if so, tell me of it, tell me how--with perfect\ncandour, I am worthy of that--a willing learner & striver; not afraid of\nthe pain of looking my own faults & shortcomings steadily in the face. It\nmay be my words have led you to do me some kind of injustice in thought--I\nthen could defend myself. But if it is simply that you are preoccupied,\ntoo busy, perhaps very eagerly beset by hundreds like myself whose hearts\nare so drawn out of their breasts by your Poems that they cannot rest\nwithout striving, some way or other, to draw near to you personally--then\nwrite once more & tell me so & I will learn to be content. But please let\nit be a letter just like the first three you wrote: & do not fear that I\nshall take it to mean anything it doesn't mean. I shall never do that\nagain, though it was natural enough at first, with the deep unquestioning\nbelief I had that I did but answer a call; that I not only might but\nought, on pain of being untrue to the greatest, sweetest instincts &\naspirations of my own soul, to answer it with all my heart & strength &\nlife. I say to myself, I say to you as I did in my first letters, \"This\nvoice that has come to me from over the Atlantic is the one divine voice\nthat has penetrated to my soul: is the utterance of a nature that sends\nout life-giving warmth & light to my inward self as actually as the Sun\ndoes to my body, & draws me to it and shapes & shall shape my course just\nas the sun shapes the earth's.\" \"Interlocked in a vast similitude\" indeed\nare these inner & outer truths of our lives. It may be that this shaping\nof my life course toward you will have to be all inward--that to feed upon\nyour words till they pass into the very substance & action of my soul is\nall that will be given to me & the grateful, yearning, tender love growing\never deeper & stronger out of that will have to go dumb & actionless all\nmy days here. But I can wait long, wait patiently; know well, realize more\nclearly indeed that this wingless, clouded, half-developed soul of me has\na long, long novitiate to live through before it can meet & answer yours\non equal terms so as fully to satisfy you, to be in very truth & deed a\ndear Friend, a chosen companion, a source of joy to you as you of light &\nlife to me. But that is what I will live & die hoping & striving for. That\ncovers & includes all the aspirations all the high hopes I am capable of.\nAnd were I to fall away from this belief it would be a fall into utter\nblackness & despair, as one for whom the Sun in Heaven is blotted out.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  50 Marquis Road\n  Camden Sq. N. W.\n  May 20th, '73.\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nSuch a joyful surprise was that last paper you sent me with the Poem\ncelebrating the great events in Spain--the new hopes the new life wakening\nin the breasts of that fine People which has slumbered so long, weighed\ndown & tormented with hideous nightmares of superstition. Are you indeed\ngetting strong & well again? able to drink in draughts of pleasure from\nthe sights & sounds & perfumes of this delicious time, \"lilac\ntime\"--according to your wont? Sleeping well--eating well, dear friend?\n\nWilliam Rossetti is coming to see me Thursday, before starting for his\nholiday trip to Naples. His father was a Neapolitan, so he narrowly\nescaped a lifelong dungeon for having written some patriotic songs--he\nfled in disguise by help of English friends & spent the rest of his life\nhere. So this, his first visit to Naples, will be specially full of\ninterest & delight to our friend. He is also in great spirits at having\ndiscovered a large number of hitherto unknown early letters of Shelley's.\nOf modern English Poets Shelley is the one he loves & admires incomparably\nthe most. Perhaps this letter will just reach you on your birthday. What\ncan I send you? What can I tell you but the same old story of a heart\nfast anchored--of a soul to whom your soul is as the sun & the fresh,\nsweet air, and the nourishing, sustaining earth wherein the other one\nbreathes free & feeds & expands & delights itself. There is no occupation\nof the day however homely that is not coloured, elevated, made more\ncheerful to me by thoughts of you & by thoughts you have given me blent in\n& suffusing all: No hope or aim or practical endeavour for my dear\nchildren that has not taken a higher, larger, more joyous scope through\nyou. No immortal aspiration, no thoughts of what lies beyond death, but\ncentre in you. And in moods of pain and discouragement, dear Friend, I\nturn to that Poem beginning \"Whoever you are holding me now in hand,\" and\nI don't know but that that one revives and strengthens me more than any.\nFor there is not a line nor a word in it at which my spirit does not rise\nup instinctively and fearlessly say--\"So be it.\" And then I read other\npoems & drink in the draught that I know is for me, because it is for\nall--the love that you give me on the broad ground of my humanity and\nwomanhood. And I understand the reality & preciousness of that. Then I say\nto myself, \"Souls are not made to be frustrated--to have their greatest &\nbest & sweetest impulses and aspirations & yearnings made abortive.\nTherefore we shall not be 'carried diverse' forever. This dumb soul of\nmine will not always remain hidden from you--but some way will be given me\nfor this love, this passion of gratitude, this set of all the nerves of my\nbeing toward you, to bring joy & comfort to you. I do not ask the When or\nthe How.\"\n\nI shall be thinking of your great & dear Mother in her beautiful old age,\ntoo, on your birthday--happiest woman in all the world that she was & is:\nforever sacred & dear to America & to all who feed on the Poems of her\nSon.\n\nGood-bye, my best beloved Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nI suppose you see all that you care to see in the way of English\nnewspapers. I often long to send you one when there is anything in that I\nfeel sure would interest you, but am withheld by fearing it would be quite\nsuperfluous or troublesome even.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Earls Colne\n  Halstead\n  August 12, 1873._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe paper has just been forwarded here which tells me you are still\nsuffering and not, as I was fondly believing, already quite emerged from\nthe cloud of sickness. My Darling, let me use that tender caressing word\nonce more--for how can I help it, with heart so full & no outlet but\nwords? My darling--I say it over & over to myself with voice, with eyes so\nfull of love, of tender yearning, sorrowful, longing love. I would give\nall the world if I might come (but am held here yet awhile by a duty\nnothing may supersede) & soothe & tend & wait on you & with such cheerful\nloving companionship lift off some of the weight of the long hours & days\n& perhaps months that must still go over while nature slowly,\nimperceptibly, but still so surely repairs the mischief within: result of\nthe tremendous ordeal to your frame of those great over-brimming years of\nlife spent in the Army Hospitals. You see dear Friend, a woman who is a\nmother has thenceforth something of that feeling toward other men who are\ndear to her. A cherishing, fostering instinct that rejoices so in tending,\nnursing, caretaking & I should be so happy it needs must diffuse a\nreviving, comforting, vivifying warmth around you. Might but these words\nbreathed out of the heart of a woman who loves you with her whole soul &\nlife & strength fulfil their errand & comfort the sorrowful heart, if\never so little--& through that revive the drooping frame. This love that\nhas grown up, far away over here, unhelped by the sweet influences of\npersonal intercourse, penetrating the whole substance of a woman's life,\nswallowing up into itself all her aspirations, hopes, longings, regardless\nof Death, looking earnestly, confidently beyond that for its fruition,\nblending more or less with every thought & act of her life--a guiding star\nthat her feet cannot choose but follow resolutely--what can be more real\nthan this, dear Friend? What can have deeper roots, or a more immortal\ngrowing power? But I do not ask any longer whether this love is believed\nin & welcomed & precious to you. For I know that what has real roots\ncannot fail to bear real flowers & fruits that will in the end be sweet &\njoyful to you; and that if I am indeed capable of being your eternal\ncomrade, climbing whereon you climb, daring all that you dare, learning\nall that you learn, suffering all that you suffer (pressing closest then)\nloving, enjoying all that you love & enjoy--you will want me. You will not\nbe able to help stretching out your hand & drawing me to you. I have\nwritten this mostly out in the fields, as I am so fond of doing--the\nserene, beautiful harvest landscape spread around--returned once more as I\nhave every summer for five & twenty years to this old village where my\nmother's family have lived in unbroken succession three hundred years,\never since, in fact, the old Priory which they have inhabited, ceased to\nbe a Priory. My Mother's health is still good--wonderful indeed for 88,\nthough she has been 30 years crippled with rheumatism. Still she enjoys\ngetting out in the sunshine in her Bath chair, & is able to take pleasure\nin seeing her friends & in having us all with her. Her father was a hale\nman at 90. These eastern counties are flat & tame, but yet under this\nsoft, smiling, summer sky lovely enough too--with their rich green meadows\n& abundant golden corn crops, now being well got in. Even the sluggish\nlittle river Colne one cannot find fault with, it nourishes such a\nluxuriant border of wild flowers as it creeps along--& turns & twists from\nsunshine into shade & from shade into sunshine so as to make the very best\n& most of itself. But as to the human growth here, I think that more than\nanywhere else in England perhaps it struggled along choked & poisoned by\ndead things of the past, still holding their place above ground. Carlyle\ncalls the clergy \"black dragoons\"--in these rural parishes they are black\nSquires, making it their chief business to instruct the labourer that his\ngrinding poverty & excessive toil, & the Squire's affluence & ease are\nequally part of the sacred order of Providence. When I have been here a\nlittle I wish myself in London again, dearly as I love outdoor life &\ncompanionship with nature. For though the same terrible & cruel facts are\nthere as here, they are not choked down your throat by any one, as a\nbeautiful & perfect ideal. Even in England light is unmistakably breaking\nthrough the darkness for the toilers.\n\nI did not see William Rossetti before I came down, but heard he had had a\nvery happy time in Italy & splendid weather all the while. Mr. Conway &\nhis wife are going to spend their holiday in Brittany. Do not think me\nchildish dear friend if I send a copy of this letter to Washington as well\nas to Camden. I want it so to get to you--long & so long to speak with\nyou--& the Camden one may never come to hand--or the Washington one might\nremain months unforwarded--it is easy to tear up.\n\nI hope it will find you by the sea shore!--getting on so fast toward\nhealth & strength again--refreshed & tranquillized, soul & body. Good-bye,\nbeloved Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XV[21]\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  I must write\n  friend once more at\n  Since I last wrote, clouds have darkened over me, and still remain.\n\nOn the night of 3d January last I was paralyzed, left side, and have\nremained so since. Feb. 19 I lost a dear dear sister, who died in St.\nLouis leaving two young daughters. May 23d, my dear inexpressibly beloved\nmother died in Camden, N. J. I was just able to get from Washington to her\ndying bed & sit there. I thought I was bearing it all stoutly, but I find\nit affecting the progress of my recovery since and now. I am still feeble,\npalsied & have spells of great distress in the head. But there are points\nmore favourable.\n\nI am up & dressed every day, sleep & eat middling well & do not change\nmuch yet, in flesh & face, only look very old.\n\nThough I can move slowly very short distances, I walk with difficulty &\nhave to stay in the house nearly all the time. As I write to-day, I feel\nthat I shall probably get well--though I may not.\n\nMany times during the past year have I thought of you & your children.\nMany times indeed have I been going to write, but did not. I have just\nbeen reading over again several of this & last year's letters from you &\nlooking at the pictures sent in the one of Jan. 24, '72. (Your letters\nof Jan. 24, June 3 & July 14, of last year and of Jan. 31, and May 20,\nthis year, with certainly one other, maybe two) all came safe. Do not\nthink hard of me for not writing in reply. If you could look into my\nspirit & emotion you would be entirely satisfied & at peace. I am at\npresent temporarily here at Camden, on the Delaware river, opposite\nPhiladelphia, at the house of my brother, and I am occupying, as I write,\nthe rooms wherein my mother died. You must not be unhappy about me, as I\nam as comfortably situated as can be--& many things--indeed every\nthing--in my case might be so much worse. Though my plans are not\ndefinite, my intention as far as anything is on getting stronger, and\nafter the hot season passes, to get back to Washington for the fall &\nwinter.\n\nMy post office address continues at Washington. I send my love to Percy &\nall your dear children.\n\nThe enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger, & send to you, with my\nlove.\n\n\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF A TYPICAL WHITMAN LETTER.\n\nFROM THOMAS B. HARNED'S COLLECTION]\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Earls Colne\n  Sept. 4, 1873._\n\nI am entirely satisfied & at peace, my Beloved--no words can say how\ndivine a peace.\n\nPain and joy struggle together in me (but joy getting the mastery, because\nits portion is eternal). O the precious letter, bearing to me the living\ntouch of your hand, vibrating through & through me as I feel the pressure\nof the ring that pressed your flesh--& now will press mine so long as I\ndraw breath. My Darling! take comfort & strength & joy from me that you\nhave made so rich & strong. Perhaps it will yet be given us to see each\nother, to travel the last stage of this journey side by side, hand in\nhand--so completing the preparation for the fresh start on the greater\njourney; me loving and blessing her you mourn, now for your dear\nsake--then growing to know & love her in full unison with you.\n\nI hope you will soon get to the sea--as soon as you are strong enough,\nthat is--& if you could have all needful care & comfort & a dear friend\nwith you there. For I believe you would get on faster away from Camden--&\nthat it tends so to keep the wound open & quivering to be where the blow\nfell on you--where every object speaks of her last hours & is laden with\nheart-stirring associations; though I realize, dearest Friend, that in the\nmidst of the poignant sorrow come immortal sweet moments--communings, rapt\nanticipations. But these would come the same in nature's great soothing\narms by the seashore, with her reviving, invigorating breath playing\nfreely over you. If only you could get just strong enough prudently to\nundertake the journey. When my eyes first open in the morning, often such\ntender thoughts, yearning ineffably, pitying, sorrowful, sweet thoughts\nflow into my breast that longs & longs to pillow on itself the suffering\nhead (with white hair more beautiful to me than the silvery clouds which\nalways make me think of it.) My hands want to be so helpful, tending,\nsoothing, serving my whole frame to support his stricken side--O to\ncomfort his heart--to diffuse round him such warm sunshine of love,\nhelping time & the inborn vigour of each organ that the disease could not\nwithstand the influences, but healthful life begin to flow again through\nevery part. My children send their love, their earnest sympathy. Do not\nfeel anyways called on to write except when inwardly impelled. Your\nsilence is not dumb to me now--will never again cloud or pain, or be\nmisconstrued by me. I can feast & feast, & still have wherewithal to\nsatisfy myself with the sweet & precious words that have now come & with\nthe feel of my ring, only send any old paper that comes to hand (never\nmind whether there is anything to read in it or not) just as a sign that\nthe breath of love & hope these poor words try to bear to you, has reached\nyou. And just one word literally that, dearest, when you begin to feel you\nare really getting on--to make me so joyful with the news.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend,\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nBack again in Marquis Road.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq.\n  Nov. 3, '73 London_\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nAll the papers have reached me--3 separate packets (with the handwriting\non them that makes my heart give a glad bound). I look through them full\nof interest & curiosity, wanting to realize as I do, in things small as\nwell as things large, my Land of Promise--the land where I hope to plant\ndown my children--so strong in the faith that they, & perhaps still more\nthose that come after them will bless me for that (consciously or\nunconsciously, it doesn't matter which) I should set out with a cheerful\nheart on that errand if I knew the first breath I drew on American soil\nwould be my last in life. I searched hopeful for a few words telling of\nimprovement in your health in the last paper. But perhaps it does not\nfollow from there being no much mention that there is no progress. May you\nbe steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground, my Darling! Now that I\nunderstand the nature of the malady (a deficient flow of blood to the\nbrain, if it has been rightly explained to me) I realize that recovery\nmust be very gradual: as the coming on of it must have been slow &\ninsidious. And perhaps that, & also even from before the war time with its\ntremendous strain, emotional & physical, is part of the price paid for the\ngreatness of the Poems & for their immortal destiny--the rapt exaltation\nthe intensity of joy & sorrow & struggle--all that went to give them\ntheir life-giving power. For I have felt many times in reading them as if\nthe light and heat of their sacred fire must needs have consumed the vital\nenergies of him in whose breast it was generated, faster then even the\nmost splendid physique could renew itself. For our sakes, for humanity's\nsake, you suffer now, I do not doubt it, every bit as much as the\nsoldier's wounds are for his country's sake. The more precious, the more\ntenderly cherished, the more drawing the hearts that understand with\nineffable yearnings, for this.\n\nMy children all continue well in the main, I am thankful to say, though\nBeatrice (the eldest girl) looks paler than I could wish and is working\nher brains too much and the rest of her too little just at present, with\nthe hope of getting through the Apothecaries Hall exam. in Arts next\nSept., which involves a good bit of Latin and mathematics. This is all\nwomen can do in England toward getting into the medical profession & as\nthe Apoth. Hall certificate is accepted for the preliminary studies at\nParis & Zurich, I make no doubt it is also at Philadelphia & New York; so\nthat she would be able to enter on medical studies, the virtual\npreliminary work, when we come. For she continues steadfastly desirous to\nwin her way into that field of usefulness, & I believe is well fitted to\nwork there, with her grave, earnest, thoughtful, feeling nature & strong\nbodily frame. She is able to enjoy your Poems & the vistas; broods over\nthem a great deal. Percy is bending his energies now to mastering the\nprocesses that go to the production of the very best quality of copper\nsuch as is used for telegraph wires &c. No easy matter, copper being the\nmost difficult, in a metallurgical point of view, of all the metals to\ndeal with & the Company in whose employ he is having hitherto been\nunsuccessful in this branch. His looks, too, do not quite satisfy me--it\nis partly rather too long hours of work--but still more not getting a good\nmeal till the end of it. It is so hard to make the young believe that the\nstomach shares the fatigue of the rest of the body and that there is not\nnervous energy enough left for it to do all its principal work to\nperfection after a long, exhausting day. But I hope now I, or rather his\nown experience and I together, have convinced him in time, and he promises\nme faithfully to arrange for a good meal in the middle of the day however\nmuch grudging the time. My little artist Herby is still chiefly working\nfrom the antique, but tries his hand at home occasionally with oils & to\nlife & has made an oil sketch of me which, though imperfect in drawing\n&c., gives far more the real character & expression of my face than the\nphotographs. Have you heard, I wonder, of William Rossetti's approaching\nmarriage? It is to take place early in the New Year. The lady is Lucy\nBrown, daughter of one of our most eminent artists (he was the friend who\nfirst put into my hand the \"Selections\" from your Poems). Lucy is a very\nsweet-tempered, cultivated, lovable woman, well fitted, I should say, to\nmake William Rossetti happy. They are to continue in the old home, Euston\nSq., with Mrs. Rossetti & the sisters, who are one and all fond of Lucy. I\nam glad he is going to be married for I think he is a man capable both of\ngiving and receiving a large measure of domestic happiness. I hope the\ndear little girls at St. Louis are well. And you, my Darling, O surely the\nsun is piercing through the dark clouds once more and strength & health\nand gladness returning. O fill yourself with happy thoughts for you have\nfilled others with joy & strength & will do so for countless generations,\n& from these hearts flows back, and will ever flow, a steady current of\nlove & the beautiful fruits of love.\n\nWhen you next send me a paper, if you feel that you are getting on ever so\nlittle, dearest friend, just a dash under the word _London_. I have looked\nback at all your old addresses & I see you never do put any lines, so I\nshall know it was not done absently but really means you are better. And\nhow that line will gladden my eyes, Darling!\n\nLove from us all. Good-bye.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq., N. W.\n  Dec. 8, 1873._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe papers with Prof. Young's speech came safely & I read it, my hand in\nyours, happy and full of interest. Are you getting on, my Darling? When I\nknow that you no longer suffer from distressing sensations in the head &\ncan move without such effort and difficulty, a hymn of thankfulness will\ngo up from my heart. Perhaps this week I shall get the paper with the line\non it that is to tell me so much--or at least that you are well on your\nway towards it. And what shall I tell you about? The quiet tenor of our\ndaily lives here? but that is very restricted, though, I trust, as far as\nit goes, good & healthful. O the thoughts and hopes that leap from across\nthe ocean & the years! But they hide themselves away when I want to put\nthem into words. Do not think I live in dreams. I know very well it is\nstrictly in proportion as the present & the past have been busy shaping &\npreparing the materials of a beautiful future, that it really will be\nbeautiful when it comes to exist as a present, seeing how it needs must be\nentirely a growth from all that has preceded it & that there are no sudden\ncreations of flowers of happiness in men & women any more than in the\nfields. But if the buds lie ready folded, ah, what the sunshine will do!\nWhat fills me with such deep joy in your poems is the sense of the large\ncomplete acceptiveness--the full & perfect faith in humanity--in _every\nindividual unit of humanity_--thus for the first time uttered. That alone\nsatisfies the sense of justice in the soul, responds to what its own\nnature compels it to believe of the Infinite Source of all. That too\nincludes within its scope the lot as well as the man. His infinite,\nundying self must achieve and fulfil itself out of any & all experiences.\nWhy, if it takes such ages & such vicissitudes to compact a bit of\nrock--fierce heat, & icy cold, storms, deluges, crushing pressure & slow\nsubsidences, as if it were like a handful of grass & all sunshine--what\nwould it do for a man!\n\n\n_Dec. 18._\n\nThe longed-for paper has come to hand. O it _is_ a slow struggle back to\nhealth, my Darling! I believe in the main it is good news that is\ncome--and there is the little stroke I wanted so on the address. But for\nall that, I feel troubled & conscious--for I believe you have been a great\ndeal worse since you wrote--and that you have still such a steep, steep\nhill to climb.\n\nPerhaps if my hand were in yours, dear Walt, you would get along faster.\nDearer and sweeter that lot than even to have been your bride in the full\nflush & strength and glory of your youth. I turn my face to the westward\nsky before I lie down to sleep, deep & steadfast within me the silent\naspiration that every year, every month & week, may help something to\nprepare and make fitter me and mine to be your comfort and joy. We are\nfull of imperfections, short-comings but half developed, but half\n\"possessing our own souls.\" But we grow, we learn, we strive--that is the\nbest of us. I think in the sunshine of your presence we shall grow fast--I\ntoo, my years notwithstanding. May the New Year lead you out into the\nsunshine again--shed out of its days health & strength, so that you tread\nthe earth in gladness again. This with love from us all. Good-bye, dearest\nFriend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nHerby was at a Conversation last night where were many distinguished men &\nbeautiful women. Among the works of art displayed on the walls was a fine\nphotograph of you.\n\n\n19th, afternoon.\n\nAnd now a later post has brought me the other No. of the _Graphic_ with\nyour own writing in it--so full of life and spirit, so fresh & cheerful &\nvivid, dear Friend, it seems to scatter all anxious sad thoughts to the\nwinds. And are you then really back at Washington, I wonder, or have you\nonly visited it in spirit, & written the recollection of former evenings?\n\nI shall have none but cheerful thoughts now. I shall reread it\ncarefully--read it to the young folk at tea to-night.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq.\n  London\n  26 Feb., 1874._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nGlad am I when the time comes round for writing to you again--though I\ncan't please myself with my letters, poor little echoes that they are of\nthe loving, hoping, far-journeying thoughts so busy within. It has been a\nhappy time since I received the paper with the joyful news you were back\nat Washington, well on your way to recovery, able partially to resume\nwork--scenting from afar the fresh breeze & sunshine of perfect health--by\nthis time, not from afar, perhaps. The thought of that makes dull days\nbright & bright days glorious to me too. I note in the New York _Graphic_\nthat a new edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" was called for--sign truly that\nAmerica is not so very slowly & now absorbing the precious food she needs\nabove all else? Perhaps, dear Friend, even during your lifetime will begin\nto come the proof you will alone accept--that \"your country absorbs you as\naffectionately as you have absorbed it.\" I have had two great pleasures\nsince I last wrote you. One is that Herby has read with a large measure of\nresponsive delight \"Leaves of Grass\" quite through, so that he now sees\nyou with his own eyes & has in his heart the living, growing germs of a\nloving admiration that will grow with his growth & strengthen every fibre\nof good in him. Also he read & took much pride in my \"letters,\" now shown\nhim for the first time. Percy has had a fortnight's holiday with us, and\nlooks better in health, though still not altogether as I could wish. He\nsays he is getting such good experience he would not care just yet to\nchange his post even for better pay. Music is his greatest pleasure--he\nseems to get more enjoyment out of that than out of literature, & is\nacquiring some practical skill.\n\nTo-day (Feb. 25th) is my birthday, dearest Friend--a day my children\nalways make very bright & happy to me: and on it they make me promise to\n\"do nothing but what I like all day.\" So I shall spend it with you--partly\nin finishing this letter, partly reading in the book that is so dear to\nme--for that is indeed my soul coming into the presence of your\nsoul--filled by it with strength & warmth & joy. In discouraged moods,\nwhen oppressed with the consciousness of my own limitations, failures,\nlack of many beautiful gifts, I say to myself, \"What sort of a bird with\nunfledged wings are you that would mate with an eagle? Can your eyes look\nthe sun in the face like his? Can you sustain your long, lifelong flights\nupward? Can you rest in dizzy rocks overhanging dark, tempestuous abysses?\nIs your heart like his, a great glowing sun of Love?\" Then I answer, \"Give\nme Time.\" I can bide my time--a long, long growing & unfolding time. That\nhe draws me with such power, that my soul has found the meaning of itself\nin him--the object of all its deep, deathless aspirations in comradeship\nwith him, means, if life is not a mockery clean ended by death, that the\ngerms are in me, that through cleaving & loving & ever striving up & on I\nshall grow like him--like but different--the correlative--what his soul\nneeds & desires; and if when I reach America he is not so drawn towards\nme,--if seeing how often I disappoint myself, needs must that he too is\ndisappointed, still I can hold bravely, lovingly on to this\ninextinguishable faith & hope--with the added joy of his presence,\nsometimes winning from him more & more a dear friendship, yielding him\nsome joy & comfort--for he too turns with hope, with yearning, towards\nme--bids me be \"satisfied & at peace!\" So I am, so I will be, my darling.\nSurely, surely, sooner or later I shall justify that hope, satisfy that\nyearning. This is what I say to myself & to you this 46th birthday. Have I\nsaid it over & over again? That is because it is the undercurrent of my\nwhole life. The _Tribune_ with Proctor's \"Lecture on the Sun\" (& a great\ndeal besides that interests me) came safe. A masterly lecture. And two\ndays ago came the Philadelphia paper with Prof. Morton's speech--deeply\ninteresting. And as I read these things, the feeling that they have come\nfrom, & been read by, you turns them into Poems for me.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nW. Rossetti's marriage is to be the end of next month. Had a pleasant chat\nwith Mr. Conway, who took supper with us a week or two ago.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n_March 9th, 1874._\n\nWith full heart, with eyes wet with tears of joy & I know not what other\ndeep emotion--pain of yearning pity blent with the sense of\ngrandeur--dearest Friend, have I read and reread the great, sacred Poem\njust come to me.[22] O august Columbus! whose sorrows, sufferings,\nstruggles are more to be envied than any triumph of conquering warrior--as\nI see him in your poem his figure merges into yours, brother of Columbus.\nCompleter of his work, discoverer of the spiritual, the ideal America--you\ntoo have sailed over stormy seas to your goal--surrounded with mocking\ndisbelievers--you too have paid the great price of health--our Columbus.\n\nYour accents pierce me through & through.\n\nYour loving ANNIE.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq.\n  May 14, 1874._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nTwo papers have come to hand since I last wrote, one containing the\nmemoranda made during the war--precious records, eagerly read & treasured\n& reread by me.\n\nHow the busy days slip by one so like another, yet each with its own fresh\n& pleasant flavour & scent, as like and as different as the leaves on a\ntree, or the plants in the hedgerows. Days they are busy with humble\nenough occupations, but lit up for me not only with the light of hope, but\nwith the half-hidden joy of one who knows she has found what she sought\nand laid such strong hold upon it that she fears nothing, questions\nnothing--no life, or death, nor in the end, in her own imperfections,\nflaws, shortcomings. For to be so conscious of these, and to love and\nunderstand you so, are proofs [that] the germs of all are in her, &\nperhaps in the warmth & joyous sunshine of your presence would grow fast.\nAnyhow, distance has not baffled her, and time will not. A great deal of\nneedlework to be done at this time of year; for my girls have not time for\nany at present; it is not a good contrast or the right thing after longish\nhours of study--much better household activity of any sort. If they would\nbut understand this in schools & colleges for girls & young women. No\nhealthier or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study, could be\nfound than household work--sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing,\ncooking--in the variety of it, & equable development of the muscles, I\nshould think equal to the most elaborate gymnastics. I know very well how\nI have felt, & still feel, the want of having been put to these things\nwhen a girl. Then the importance afterwards of doing them easily & well &\nwithout undue fatigue, to all who aim to give practical shape to their\nardent belief in equality & fair play for all. In domestic life under one\nroof, at all events, it is already feasible to make the disposals without\nignominious distinctions--not all the rough bodily work, never ending,\nleisure all to the other; but a wholesome interchange and sharing of\nthese. Not least too among the advantages of taking an active share in\nthese duties is the zest, the keen relish, it gives to the hours not too\neasily secured for reading & music. Besides, I often think that just as\nthe Poem Nature is made up half of rude, rough realities and homely\nmaterials & processes, so it is necessary for women to construct their\nPoem, Home, on a groundwork of homeliest details & occupations, providing\nfor the bodily wants & comforts of their household, and that without\nputting their own hands to this, their Poem will lack the vital, fresh,\ngrowing, nature-like quality that alone endures, and that of this soil\nwill grow, with fitting preparation & culture, noble & more vigorous\nintellectual life in women, fit to embody itself in wider spheres\nafterwards--if the call comes.\n\nThis month of May that comes to you so laden with great and sorrowful &\nbeautiful & tender memories, and that is your birth-month too, I cannot\nsay that I think of you more than at any other time, for there is no month\nnor day that my thoughts do not habitually & spontaneously turn to you,\nrefer all to you--yet I seem to come closer because of the Poems that tell\nme of what relates to that time; but most of all when I think of your\nbeloved Mother, because then I often yearn, more than I know how to bear,\nto comfort you with love and tender care and silent companionship. May is\nin a sense (& a very real one) my birth-month too, for in it were your\nPoems first put into my hand. I wish I were _quite sure_ that you no\nlonger suffer in your head, and that you can move about without effort or\ndifficulty--perhaps before long there will be a paper with some paragraph\nabout your health, for though we say to ourselves no news is good news, it\nis a very different thing to have the absolute affirmation of good news.\n\nMy children are all well and hearty, I am thankful to say, & working\nindustriously. Grace means to study the best system of kindergarten\nteaching--I fancy she is well suited for kindergarten teaching & that it\nis very excellent work.\n\nHerby is still drawing from the antique in the British Museum. I hope he\nwill get into the Academy this summer. He is going to spend his holidays\nwith his brother in South Wales--and we as usual at Colne, but that will\nnot be till August.\n\nDid I tell you William Rossetti and his bride were spending their\nhoneymoon at Naples? & have found it bitterly cold there, I learn. Mr. &\nMrs. Conway & their children are well. Eustace is coming to spend the\nafternoon with Herby to-morrow.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq.\n  July 4, 1874._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nAre you well and happy, and enjoying this beautiful summer? London is, in\none sense, a sort of big prison at this time of year: but still at a wide\nopen window, with the blue sky opening to me & a soft breeze blowing in &\nthe Book that is so dear--my life-giving treasure--open on my lap, I have\nvery happy times. No one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy in\nthese poems than I--breathe the fresh, sweet, exhilarating air of them,\nbathe in it, drink in what nourishes & delights the whole being, body,\nintellect & soul, more than I. Nor could you, when writing them, have\ndesired to come nearer to a human being & be more to them forever &\nforever than you are & will be to me. O I take the hand you stretch out\neach day--I put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment: I ask\nnothing more of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that\ncompanionship that includes all.\n\n6th. This very morning has come the answer to my question. First I only\nsaw the Poem--read it so elate--soared with it to joyous heights, said to\nmyself: \"He is so well again, he is able to take the journey into\nMassachusetts & speak the kindling words.\" Then I turned over and my joy\nwas dashed. My Darling; such patience yet needed along the tedious path!\nOh, it makes me long, with passionate longings, with yearnings I know not\nhow to bear, to come, to be your loving, cheerful companion, the one to\ntake such care, to do all for you--to beguile the time, to give you of my\nhealth as you have done to tens of thousands. I do not doubt, either, but\nthat you will get well. I feel sure, sure, it will be given me to see you;\nand perhaps a very slow, gradual recovery is safest--is the only way in\nthis as in other matters to thoroughness; & a very speedy rally would be\nspecious, treacherous, in the end, leading you to do what you were not yet\nfit for. I believe if I could only make you conscious of the love, the\nenfolding love, my heart breathes out toward you it would do you physical\ngood; many-sided love--Mother's love that cherishes, that delights so in\npersonal service, that sees in sickness & suffering such dear appeals to\nan answering, limitless tenderness--wife's love--ah, you draw that from me\ntoo, resistlessly--I have no choice--comrade's love, so happy in sharing\nall, pain, sorrow, toil, effort, enjoyments, thoughts, hopes, aims,\nstruggles, disappointment, beliefs, aspirations. Child's love, too, that\ntrusts utterly, confides unquestioningly. Not more spontaneously, & wholly\nwithout effort or volition on my part, does the sunlight flow into my eyes\nwhen I open them in the morning than does the sense of your existence\nenter like bright light into my awaking soul. And then I send to you\nthoughts--tender, caressing thoughts--that would fain nestle so close--ah,\nif you could feel them, take them in, let them lie in your breast, each\nmorning.\n\nMy children are all well, dear Friend. Herbert is going to spend his\nholidays with his brother in Wales--& we shall all go to Colne as usual\nthe end of this month & remain there through August and September; so if\nyou think of it, address any paper you may send [to] Earls Colne,\nHalstead, because I should get it a day sooner. But it does not signify if\nyou forget & send it here; it will be forwarded all right. Beatrice has\njust got through one of the Govern. Exams. in elementary mathematics; and\nI hope Herby has got into the Academy, but do not know for certain yet. He\nworks away zealously and with great delight in his work. William Rossetti\nand his wife are coming to dine with us Wednesday--they look so well and\nhappy, it does one good to see them. The Conways are going to Ostend, I\nthink, for their holiday, & when they come back [are] going to move into a\nlarger house. I heard an American lady, Miss Whitman, sing at a concert\nthe other day, who delighted me, fascinated me--I longed to kiss her after\neach song, though some of them were poor enough Verdi stuff--but she\ncontrived to impart genuineness & beauty to them. I hope you will hear her\nwhen she returns to America, which will be soon, I believe.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend. Beatrice, Herby & Grace join their love with\nmine. I had the sweet little Bridal Poem all safe, & by the bye I liked\nthat Springfield paper very much.\n\nYour loving ANNIE.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Earls Colne\n  Sept. 3, 1874._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe change down here has refreshed me more than usual and I find my Mother\nstill wonderful for her years (the 89th), able to get out daily in her\nBath chair for two or three hours--to enjoy our being with her, and\nsuffering little or no pain from rheumatism now. I hope you have had as\nglorious a summer & harvest as we have, and that you are able to be much\nout of doors and absorb the health-giving influences, dear Friend. Such\nmornings! So fresh and invigourating. I have been before breakfast mostly\nin a beautiful garden (the old Priory garden) with my beloved Poems and\nthe dew-laden flowers and liquid light and sweet, fresh air; & the sparkle\nof the pond & delicious greenness of the meadows beyond & rustling trees,\nand had a joyful time with you, my Darling--sometimes with thoughts that\nlay hold on \"the solid prizes of the Universe,\" sometimes so busy building\nup a home in America, thinking, dreaming, hoping, loving, groping among\ndim shadows, straining wistful eyes into the dim distance--then to my\npoems again--ah! not groping then, but hand in hand with you, breathing\nthe air you breathe, with eyes ardently fixed in the same direction your\neyes look, heart beating strong with the same hopes, aspirations, yours\nbeats with. It does not need to be American to love America and to believe\nin the great future of humanity there; it is curious to be human, still\nmore English to do that. I love & believe in & understand her in & through\nyou: but was always drawn towards her, always a believer, though in a\nvaguer way, that a new glorious day for men & women was dawning there, and\nrecognized a new, distinctive American quality, very congenial to me, even\nin American virtues, which you not perhaps rate highly or retard as\ndecisively national, not adequately or commandingly so, at any rate. Did I\never tell you the cousin of mine[23] who owns the priory here fought for\ntwo years in the Secession war in the army of the Potomac when Burnside &\nMcClellan were at the head? John Cowardine was Major in a Cavalry\nregiment--was at Vicksburg, Frederickburg, &c. Never wounded, or but\nslightly--had a good deal of outpost duty, being just the right sort of a\nman for that, & has letters of approval from his generals of which he is\nnot a little proud. Before that fought under the Stars & Stripes in Mexico\n& has had a curiously adventurous career, which he commenced by running\naway from a military college, where he was being prepared for a cadetship,\n& enlisting as a private--getting out of that by & bye and working his way\nbefore the mast as a sailor--then mining in California--then in Australia,\nriding steeplechases, keeper of the Melrose hounds, market gardening,\nhotel keeping, then on his way back to California, cast ashore on one of\nthe Navigator Islands, where he remained for six months, the only white\nman among savages, who were friendly & made much of him--now, come into a\ngood estate, married to a woman who seems to suit him well & is healthy,\ncheerful rich & handsome, he has fallen into indifferent health &\nconsiderable depression of spirits. Perhaps he finds the atmosphere of\nSquirearchical gentility very stagnant, the bed of roses\nstifling--perhaps, too, the severe privations he has at different times\nundergone have injured him. I often think he was perhaps one of those\nyour eyes rested on with pride & admiration--\"handsome, tan-faced, dressed\nin blue.\" He is the very ideal of a soldier in appearance & bearing--has\nnow some fine children, of whom he is very fond.\n\nIt was just this time of year I received the precious letter and ring that\nput peace and joy, and yet such pain of yearning, into my heart--pain for\nyou, my Darling. O sorrowing helpless love that waits, and must wait,\nuseless, afar off, while you suffer. But trying every day of my life to\ngrow fitter, more capable of being your comfort and joy and true\ncomrade--never to cease trying this side death or the other--rejoicing in\nmy children more than I ever rejoiced in them before, now that in and\nthrough you I for the first time see and understand humanity (myself\nincluded)--its divine nature, its possibilities, nay, its certainties. How\nI do long for you to see my children, dear Friend, and for them to see and\nlove you as they will love you, and all their nature unfold and grow more\nvigorously and joyously under your influence. Gracie, of whom you have\nphotographs, grows fast,--is such a fine, blooming girl. I hope soon to\nsend you one of Beatrice too. They have been enjoying their visit here and\nare now gone home. Gracie for school, Beatrice for the examination at\nApoth. Hall she is hoping to get through. Then she is coming here to be\nwith my Mother, & I going back to London. We mean now one or other of us\nalways to be with my Mother here. Herby has had such a happy time with his\nbrother in Wales--& is looking as brown as a nut & full of health &\nlife--he had a swim in the sea every day. He did succeed in getting into\nthe Academy, & will begin work there Oct. 1st! Be sure, dear Friend, if\nthere is a word about your health in any paper to send it me--that is what\nI search for so eagerly--to have the joyful news you are getting on--but\neven if it is but so very very slowly, still I would rather know the\ntruth? I do not like thinking of you mistakenly. I want to send you the\nthoughts, the yearnings, that belong to you, the cherishing love that\nenfolds you most tenderly of all when you suffer. O if I could send it!\nand the cheerful companionship, beguiling the time while strength creeps\nback. I hope your little nieces at St. Louis are well.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest Friend. Herby, the only one here with me, would like\nto join his love with mine.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nI go back the beginning of October.\n\n_Sep. 14th._\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq. London\n  Dec. 9, 1874._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nIt did me much good to get your Poem--beautiful, earnest, eloquent words\nfrom the soul whose dear companionship mine seeks with persistent\nlonging--wrestling with distance & time. It seems to me, too, from your\nhaving spoken the Poem yourself I may conclude you have made fair\nprogress. What I would fain know is whether you have recovered the use of\nthe left side so far as to get about pretty freely and to have as much\nopen-air life as you need & like; and also whether you have quite ceased\nto suffer distressing sensations in the head. If you can say yes to the\nfirst question, will you in sign of it put a dash under the word _London_,\nand if yes to the second under _England_, when you next send me a paper?\nUnless indeed the paper itself contain a notice of your health. But if it\ndoes not, that would be an easy way of gladdening me with good news, if\ngood news there is. I wish I could send you good letters, dearest Friend,\nmaking myself the vehicle of what is stirring around me in life & thought\nthat would interest you; for there is plenty. But that is very hard to\ndo--though I watch, hear, read eagerly, full of interest. Everything stirs\nin me a cloud of questions, makes me want to see its relationship to what\nI hold already. I am forever brooding, pondering, sifting, testing--but\nthat is not the bent of mind that enables one to reproduce one's\nimpressions in compact & lively form. So please, dear Friend, be\nindulgent, as indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine\nwith their details of my children & their iterated and reiterated\nexpressions of the love and hope and aspiration you have called into life\nwithin me--take them not for what they are, but for all they have to stand\nfor. Beatrice is at Colne (having got well through the exam. we were\nanxious about in the autumn) and is a very great comfort to my Mother--as\nI well knew she would be; for a more affectionate, devoted, care-taking\nnature does not breathe--with a strong active mental life of her own too.\nSo, though missing her sorely, I am well satisfied she should be there;\nand the country life and rest are doing her a world of good. My artist boy\nis working away cheerily at the R. Academy, his heart in his work. Percy\nis coming to spend Xmas with us--he, too, continues well content with his\nwork and in good health. Gracie is blooming. The Rossettis have had a\nheavy affliction this first year of their married life in the premature\ndeath of her only brother--a young man of considerable promise--barely 20.\n\nThe Conways are well. I feel more completely myself than I have done since\nmy illness--so you see, dear friend, if it has taken me quite four years\nto recover the lost ground, one must not be discouraged if two do not\naccomplish it in your case. I hope your little nieces[24] at St. Louis are\nwell--and the brothers you are with, and that you have many dear friends\nround you at Camden.\n\nI think my thoughts fly to you on strongest and most joyous wings when I\nam out walking in the clear, cold, elastic air I enjoy so much.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest Friend.\n\nANNIE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nA cheerful Christmas, a New Year of which each day brings its share of\nrestorative influence, be yours.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd.\n  Camden Sq.\n  Dec. 30, 1874._\n\nI see, my dearest Friend, I must not look for those dashes under the words\nI thought were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes. I see\nhow the dark clouds linger. Full of pain & indignation. I read the\nparagraph--but fuller still of yearning tenderness & trust and hope. I\nbelieve, my dear love, that what you need to help on your recovery is a\nwoman's tender, cherishing love and care, and that in that warm, genial\natmosphere the spring of life will be quickened once more and flow full\nand strong through all its channels as of old, gradually, not quickly,\neven so. I dare say: but with plenty of patience; with utmost intelligent\ncare of all conditions favourable to health, of diet, of abundant oxygen\nin the rooms you inhabit, of as much outdoor life as possible, of happy,\ncheerful companionship, & all the homely everyday domestic joys which are\nso helpful in their influences. America is doing what nations in all times\nhave done towards that which is profoundly new & great, that which\ndiscredits their old ideals and offers them strange fruits & flowers from\nanother world than that they have been content to dwell in all their\nlives. But for all that I do not believe the precious seed is lying\ndormant even now--everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured &\nyields a noble growth. Since it is America that has produced you nourished\nyour soul and body, she is silently, unnoticed, producing men & women who\nwill justify you, who will understand the meaning of all and respond with\na love that will quicken & exalt humanity as Christ's influence once did.\nStill it is inscrutable to me that the heart of America is not now\npassionately drawn toward the great heart that beats & glows in these\nPoems--that \"Drum Taps,\" at any rate, are not as dear to her as the memory\nof her dead heroes, sons, brothers, husbands. It must be that they really\ndo not reach the hands of the American people at large--that the\nprofessedly literary, cultivated class asking for nothing better than the\npretty sing-song sentimentalities which \"join them in their nonsense,\" or\nelse slavishly prostrating their judgments before the models of the past\n(so perfect for their day, so wholly inadequate for ours), raise their\nvoices so loud in newspapers & magazines as to prevent or everywhere check\nthe circulation.\n\n_Jan. 1._ The New Year has come in bleakly & keenly to the inner as well\nas to the outer sense, with the papers full of the details of the dark\nfate of the emigrant ship & of the terrible railway accidents. Percy was\nnot able to join us at Xmas (through business) but I am expecting him\nto-night. My mother bears up against the cold wonderfully--& even\ncontinues to go out in her chair. Bee's letters are very bright &\ncheerful--she & indeed all my children enjoy the cold much, provided they\nhave plenty of out-door exercise--above all skating, which they are now\nenjoying. I too like it, but am so haunted by the thought of the increased\nmisery it brings to our hundreds of thousands of ill-fed, ill-clothed,\nill-housed. I trust the family circle round you & your nieces at St. Louis\n& all near & dear to you are well, and that you have felt the warm grasp\nof many loving friends this wintry, cloudy time, my dearest--and that\nthere may breathe out of these poor words a warm, bright glow of love and\nhope & unrestricted trust in the future.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Earls Colne, Halstead\n  Feb. 21, 1875._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI have run down to Colne for a glimpse of my dear Bee, whom I had not seen\nfor five months, and of my Mother; & now I am alone with the latter,\nBeatrice taking my place at home with her brother & sister for a week or\ntwo. A wonderful evergreen my Mother continues; still able to face the\nkeen winds & the frost daily in her Bath chair--well swathed, of course in\neiderdown & flannels. Beatrice takes beautiful care of her & is happy &\ncontent with her life here, loving the country as dearly as I do & having\ntime enough for study & reading, as well as for domestic activities, to\nkeep her mind as busy as her body. How I do long for you to see my\nchildren, dearest Friend. I wonder if you are surrounded with any in your\nbrother's home--young, growing, blossoming plants that gladden you. And I\nwonder if the winter, which I hear is so severe in America this year,\ntries you--whether you can yet move briskly enough to keep up the\ncirculation--and whether you have as many dear friends round you as you\nhad at Washington. In my walks I keep thinking of these things. Write me a\nlittle letter once more, it would do me such good. No one of all your\nfriends so easy as I to write to because none to whom any & every little\ndetail is so welcome, so precious--lifting a tiny corner of the great vast\nof space between us, giving me for a moment to feel the friendly grasp of\nyour hand--I that long for it so. Two years are over since your illness\nbegan, or seemed to begin, dearest friend--so slow & stealthy in its\napproaches, so slow & stealthy in its retreat--may the spring that is\ncoming (the birds have already caught sight of it, cold & brown & bare as\nthe landscape still is)--may it but come laden with healing,\nstrengthening, refreshing influences--so that you begin to feel again the\njoyous freedom of health, warbling once more a song of joy for lilac time.\nTrue, I know indeed, my dearest, that anyhow you are content, not grudging\nthe price paid for your life work, but even some way or other the richer\nfor paying it--garnering precious equivalents for pain & privation of\nhealth in your inmost soul. I cannot choose but believe this\nearnestly--the resplendent faith that there is not \"one cause nor result\nlamentable, at last, in the Universe\" which glows throughout the Poems is\nfor me an exhaustless source of strength & comfort.--I see every now &\nthen & like the more each time the Conways. I am half afraid Mr. Conway\nworks too incessantly--that is, does not like well enough the\nindispensable supplement of close mental work--plenty of air & exercise,\n&c.,--hates walking, & indeed it is not to be wondered at in great, smoky\nLondon (I shall be fond enough & proud enough of it too when I am over the\nAtlantic). Unless one has a real passion for open air & the sense of sky\noverhead, like me. I hear Mr. Conway is coming to America for six months\nin October.\n\n_Feb. 25_--I kept my letter till to-day that I might have the happiness of\nspeaking to you on my birthday. See me this evening in the bright,\ncheerful parlour of our cottage, which stands just in the middle of the\nold village (it has been a village & jogged on through all change at its\nown sober, sleepy pace this 800 years)--my mother in her arm chair by the\nfire; I chatting with her & working or playing to her when she is awake; &\nwith the Poems I love beside me, reading, musing, wondering while she\ndozes. Ah, shall I ever attain to the Ideal that burst upon me with such\nsplendour of light & joy in those Poems in 1869--so filling, so possessing\nme, I seemed as if I had by one bound attained to that ideal--as if I were\nalready a very twin of the soul from whom they emanated. But now I know\nthat divine foretaste indicated what was possible for me, not what was\naccomplished--I know the slow growth--the standstill winters that follow\nthe growing joyous springs & ripening summers. I believe it will take more\nlives than this one to reach that mountain on which I was transfigured\nagain, never to descend more, but to start thence for new heights, fresh\nglories. Ah, dear friend, will you be able to have patience with me, for\nme?\n\nGood-bye, my dearest.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _50 Marquis Rd., Camden Sq.\n  London,\n  May 18, 1875._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nSince last I wrote to you at the beginning of April (enclosing a little\nphotograph of that avenue just by our cottage at Colne) I have been into\nWales for a fortnight to see Percy, & have looked for the first time in my\nlife on the Atlantic--the ocean my mental eyes travel over & beyond so\noften and that your eyes and ears & heart have been fed by, have communed\nwith and interpreted, as in a new tongue, to the soul of man. Looking upon\nthat, watching the tides ebb & flow on your shores, sharing, through my\nbeloved book, in those greatest movements you have spent alone with\nit--that was a new joyful experience, a fresh kind of communing with\nyou.--I went to Wales because I felt anxious about Percy, who is not happy\njust now. I must not tell friends here about it (except his brother &\nsisters) but I am sure I may tell you, for you will listen with sympathy.\nHe has attached himself very deeply, I think it will prove, to a girl, &\nshe to him, whose parents welcomed him cordially to their house for a year\nor two & allowed plenty of intercourse till they became aware through\nPercy himself (who thought it right to tell the father as soon as he was\nfully aware of his own feelings & more than suspected Norah's response to\nthem) that there was a strong affection growing up between the two. Then\nthey peremptorily forbade all intercourse--not because they have any\nobjection to Percy--quite the contrary, they say; but solely and simply\nbecause he is not yet earning money enough to marry on, & they hold that a\nman has no right to engage a girl's affections till he can do so. As if\nthese things could be timed to the moment the money comes in! Percy was in\nhopes, & so was I, that if I went down, I might get sense enough into\ntheir heads, if not kindness & sympathy into their hearts, to see that the\nsole effect of such arbitrary & narrow-sighted conduct would be to\nalienate & embitter the young people's feelings toward them, while it\nwould make them more restless & anxious to marry without adequate means.\nWhereas if a reasonable amount of intercourse were allowed, it would be a\nhappy time with them, & Norah being still so young (18), & Percy working\naway with all his might, doing very well for his age & sure,\nconscientious, thorough, capable, & well trained worker that he is (for\nthe L. School of Mais gives a first rate scientific preparation for his\nprofession) to be making a modest sufficiency in a year or two. Well, they\nwere very courteous & indeed friendly to me, & I think I have won over the\nmother; but the father remains obdurate, & Percy feels bitterly the\nseparation--all the more trying as they live almost within sight of each\nother. So Beatrice & Grace are going to spend their holidays with him this\nsummer to cheer him up. Meanwhile, dear friend, I am on the whole happier\nthan not about him. I liked what I saw of Norah & believe he has found a\nvery sweet, affectionate girl of quiet, domestic nature, practical,\nindustrious, sensible--thoroughly well to suit him, & that there is true &\ndeep love between them--also, she took to me very much, & I feel will be\nquite another child to me. It is besides no little joy to me to find how\nPercy has confided in me in this & chooses me as the friend to whom he\ntells all--far from being any separation, as sometimes happens, this love\nof his seems to draw us closer together. Only I am very, very anxious for\nhis sake to see him in a better berth--they would let her marry him on\nL300 a year; now he has only L175. He is quite competent to manage iron or\ncopper or tin works, only he looks so young, not having yet any beard or\nmoustache to speak of. That is the end of my long story.\n\nThis will reach you on your birthday perhaps, my dearest Friend; at any\nrate it must bear you a greeting of love and fond remembrance for that\ndear day such as my heart will send you when it actually comes: patiently\nwaiting heart, with the fibres of love and boundless trust & joy & hope\nwhich bind me to you bedded deep, grown to be, during these long years, a\nvery part of its immortal substance, untouchable by age or varying moods\nor sickness, or death itself, as I surely believe. I long more than words\ncan tell to know how it fares with you now in health and spirit. My\nchildren are all well & growing & unfolding to my heart's content.\nBeatrice & Herbert deeply influenced by your Poems. Good-bye, my dearest\nFriend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Address\n  1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Road, N. W.\n  London\n\n  Earls Colne\n  Aug. 28, 1875._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYour letter came to me just when I most needed the comfort of it--when I\nwas watching and tending my dear Mother as she gently, slowly, with but\nlittle suffering, sank to rest. There was no sick bed to sit by--we got\nher up and out into the air and sunshine for an hour or two even the day\nbefore she died--No disease, only the stomach could not do its work any\nlonger & for the last three weeks she lived wholly on stimulants,\nsuffering somewhat from sickness. She drew her last breath very gently\nbefore daybreak on the 15th inst., in her 90th year, which she had entered\nin Jan. She looked very beautiful in death, notwithstanding her great\nage--as well she might--tranquil sunset that it was of a beautiful day--a\nfulfilled life--joy & delight of her father in youth (who used to call her\nthe apple of his eye), good wife, devoted, self-sacrificing, wise\nmother--patient, courageous sufferer through thirty years of chronic\nrheumatism, which, however, neutralized & ceased its pains the last few\nyears--unsurpassed, & indeed I think unsurpassable, in\nconscientiousness--in the strong sense of duty & perfect obedience to that\nhighest sense--she is one of those who amply justify your large faith in\nwomen.\n\nI do not need to tell you anything, my dearest friend--you know all--I\nfeel your strong comforting hand--I press it very close.\n\nI had all my children with me at the funeral.\n\nO the comfort your dear letter was & is to me. Thinking over & over the\nfew words you say of yourself--& what is said in the paper (so eagerly\nread--every word so welcome) I cannot help fancying that the return of the\ndistressing sensations in the head must be caused by your having worked at\nthe book--the \"Two Rivulets\" (I dearly like the title & the idea of\nbringing the Poems & Prose together so)--that you must be more patient\nwith yourself and submit still to perfect rest--& that perhaps in regard\nto the stomach--you have not enough adapted your diet to the privation of\nexercise--that you must be more indulgent to the stomach too in the sense\nof giving it only the very easiest & simplest work to do. My children join\ntheir love with mine.\n\nYour own loving\n\nANNE.\n\n\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF ONE OF ANNE GILCHRIST'S LETTERS TO WALT\nWHITMAN]\n\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF ONE OF ANNE GILCHRIST'S LETTERS TO WALT\nWHITMAN]\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd., Nov. 16, 1875.\n  London_\n\nI have been wanting the comfort of a talk with you, dearest Friend, for\nweeks & weeks, without being able to get leisure & tranquillity enough to\ndo it to my heart's content--indeed, heart's content is not for me at\npresent--but restless, eager, longing to come--& the struggle to do\npatiently & completely & wisely what remains for me here before I am free\nto obey the deep faith and love which govern me--so let me sit close\nbeside you, my Darling--& feel your presence & take comfort & strength &\nserenity from it as I do, as I can when with all my heart & soul I draw\nclose to you, realizing your living presence with all my might.--First,\nabout Percy--things are beginning to look a little brighter for him. He is\njust entering upon a new engagement with some very large & successful\nworks--the Blenavon Iron Co.--where, though his salary will not be higher\nat first, his opportunities of improvement will be better & he is also to\nbe allowed to take private practice (in assaying & analyzing). The manager\nthere believes in Science & is friendly to Percy & will give him every\nfacility for showing what he can do, so that he hopes to prove to the\nDirectors before long that he is worth a good salary. The parents of Norah\n(whom he loves) have released from their unfriendly attitude since my\nBeatrice has been staying with them; the two girls have attached\nthemselves to one another & Per. has had delightful opportunities of\nbeing with Norah, & best of all, she is to return here with Beatrice (they\nare coming to-morrow), & Per. is to have a week's holiday & come up, so\nthat he & Norah will be wholly together & have, I suspect, the happiest\nweek they have yet had in their lives. Then I have stored away for them\nthe furniture of the dear old home at Colne, & I really think that by the\ntime '76 is out they will be able to marry. I see, and indeed I have known\never since he formed this attachment, that I must not look for him to come\nto America with me. But what I build upon, Dearest Friend, is that when I\nhave been a little while in America & have made friends & had time to look\nabout me I might hear of a good certainty for him--his excellent training\nat the School of Mines, large experience at Blenavon, energy, ability, &\nsturdy uprightness will make him a first-rate manager of works by & bye.\nBut the leaving him so happy with his young wife will make it easier for\nus to part. _Nov. 26_--Beatrice has begun to work at anatomy at the School\nof Medicine for Women lately founded, & seems to delight in her work. She\nwill not enter on the full course all at once--I am for taking things\ngently. Women have plenty of strength but it is of a different kind from\nmen's & must work by gentler & slower means--Above all I do not like what\npushes violently aside domestic duties & pleasures. The special work must\ncombine itself with these; I am sure it can. Herby is getting on very\nnicely--never did student love his work better. He is eager, & by making\nthe best use of present opportunities & advantages yet looking towards\nAmerica full of cheerful hopes & sympathy. Grace is less developed in\nintellect but not less in character than the others. I can't describe her\nbut send you her photograph. There is a freshness & independence of\ncharacter about her--yet withal a certain waywardness & reserve. She is a\ngood, instinctive judge of character--more influenced by it than by\nbooks--yet with a growing taste for them too. She comes to America with a\ngay and buoyant curiosity, declining to make up her mind about anything\ntill she gets there. We want, as far as possible, to transplant our home\nbodily--to bring as much as we can of our own furniture because we have\nbeautiful old things precious in Herby's eyes & that we are all fond of.\nAnd [by] coming straight to Philadelphia & taking a house somewhere on the\noutskirts of it or Camden immediately we fancy this might be practicable,\nbut have not yet launched into the matter. I have just heard from Mr.\nRossetti, and also from Mrs. Conway of her husband having seen you, & if\nhis report be not too sanguine it is a cheering one & would comfort me\nmuch, dearest Friend. But what he says is so favourable I am afraid to\nbelieve it altogether, knowing that you would make the very best of\nyourself & indeed be probably at your best with the pleasure of seeing an\nold friend fresh from England. _Nov._ 30. And now, dear Friend, I have had\na very great pleasure indeed, thanks to you--a visit from Mr. Marvin--& I\nhope to have another when he returns from Paris. And the account he gives\nof you is so cheerful--so vivid--it seems to part asunder a gloomy cloud\nthat was brooding in my mind. And though I know that for the short hours\nthat you feel bright & well are many long hours when you are far\notherwise, still I feel sure those short hours are the earnest of perfect\nrecovery--with a fine patience--boundless patience. And now I can picture\nyou sitting in your favourite window, having a friendly word with\npassers-by--& feel quite sure that you are happy & comfortable in your\nsurroundings. And a great deal else full of interest Mr. Marvin told me. I\nwas loth for him to go, but one hour is so small, we have noticed, for a\nfriend, I am sorry to say.\n\nWilliam Rossetti has a little girl which is a great delight to him. Miss\nHillard of Brooklyn has also paid me a visit & spoken to me of you. She\ncharmed me much--only I felt a little cross with her for giving Herby such\na dismal account of his chances as an artist in America. However, we both\nrefused to be discouraged, for after all he can send his pictures to\nEngland to be established &c., having plenty of friends who would see to\nit; & we are both firm in the faith that if you can only paint the really\ngood pictures the rest will take care of itself, somehow or other--& that\ncan be done as well in America as in England, but of course he must finish\nhis training here.\n\nWith best love from us all, good-bye, my dearest Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd., London\n  Dec. 4, 1875._\n\nThough it is but a few days since I posted a letter, my dearest friend, I\nmust write you again--because I cannot help it, my heart is so full--so\nfull of love & sorrow & struggle. The day before yesterday I saw Mr.\nConway's printed account of you, & instead of the cheerful report I had\nbeen told of, he speaks of your having given up hope of recovery. Those\nwords were like a sharp knife plunged into me--they choked me with bitter\ntears. _Don't give up that hope_ for the sake of those that so tenderly,\npassionately, love you--would give their lives with joy for you. Why, who\nknows better than you how much hope & the will have to do with it, & I\nknow quite well that the belief does not depress you--that you are ready\nto accept either lot with calmness, cheerfulness, perfect faith, perhaps\nwith equal joy. But for all that, it does you harm. Ideas always have a\ntendency to accomplish themselves. And what right have the Doctors to\nutter gloomy prophecies? The wisest of them know the best how profoundly\nin the dark they are as to much that goes on within us, especially in\nmaladies like yours. O cling to life with a resolute hold, my beloved, to\nbless us with your presence unspeakably dear, beneficent presence--me to\ntaste of it before so very long now--thirsting, pining, loving me. Take\nthrough these poor words of mine some breath of the tender, tender,\nineffable love that fills my heart and soul and body--take of it to\nstrengthen the very springs of your life: it is capable of that; O its\ncherishing warmth and joy, if it could only get to you, only fold you\nround close enough, would help, I know. Soon, soon as ever my boy has one\nto love & care for him all his own, I will come; I may not before, not if\nit should break my heart to stop away from you, for his welfare is my\nsacred charge & nearer & dearer than all to me. Verily, my God, strengthen\nme, comfort me, stay for me--let that have a little beginning on this dear\nearth which is for all eternity, which will live & grow immortally into a\ndiviner reality than the heart of man has conceived.\n\nI am well satisfied with Norah, dear Friend. She is very affectionate,\nloveable, prudent, & clear in all practical matters, well suited to Percy\nin tastes, &c.\n\n  Your own\n  ANNIE.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Blaenavon\n  Routzpool\n  Mon. England\n  Jan. 18, '76._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nDo not think me too wilful or headstrong, but I have taken our tickets &\nwe shall sail Aug. 30 for Philadelphia. I found if I did not come to a\ndecision now, we could not well arrange it before next summer. And since\nwe _have_ come to a decision my mind has been quite at rest. Do not feel\nany anxiety or misgivings about us. I have a clear and strong conviction I\nam doing what is right & best for us all. After a busy anxious time I am\nhaving a week or two of rest with Percy, who I find fairly well in health\n& prospering in his business--indeed, he bids fair to have a large private\npractice as an analyst here, & is already making income enough to marry\non, only there is to build the nest--& I think he will have actually to\n_build_ it, for there seem no eligible houses--& to furnish--so that the\nwedding will not be till next spring or early summer. Nevertheless, with a\ndefinite goal & a definite time & the way between not so very rugged,\nthough rather dull and lonely, I think he will be pretty cheery. This\nlittle town (of 11,000 inhabitants, all miners, smelters &c.) lies up\namong the hills 1100 ft. above the sea--glorious hills here, spreading,\nthen converging, with wooded flanks, & swift brooklets leaping over stones\nin the hollows--the air, too, of course deliciously light & pure. I have\nheard through a friend of ours of Bee's fellow student who lives in Camden\n(Mr. Suerkrop, I think his name is) that we shall be able to get a very\ncomfortable home with pleasant garden there for about L55 per an. I think\nI can manage that very well--so all I need is to hear of a comfortable\nlodging or boarding house (the former preferred) where we can be, avoiding\nhotels even while we hunt for the house. I have arranged for my goods to\nsail a week later than we do, so as to give us time.\n\nGood-bye for a short while, my dearest Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nBee has obtained a very satisfactory account of the Women's Medical\nCollege in Philadelphia & introductions to the Head, &c.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd.\n  London\n  Feb. 25, '76._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI received the paper & enclosed slip Saturday week, filling me so full of\nemotion I could not write, for I am too bitterly impatient of mere words.\nSoon, very soon, I come, my darling. I am not lingering, but held yet a\nlittle while by the firm grip of conscience--this is the last spring we\nshall be asunder--O I passionately believe there are years in store for\nus, years of tranquil, tender happiness--me making your outward life\nserene & sweet--you making my inward life so rich--me learning, growing,\nloving--we shedding benign influences round us out of our happiness and\nfulfilled life--Hold on but a little longer for me, my Walt--I am\nstraining every nerve to hasten the day--I have enough for us all (with\nthe simple, unpretending ways we both love best).\n\nPercy is battling slowly--doing as well as we could expect in the time. I\nthink he will soon build the nest for his mate. I think he never in his\nheart believed I really should go to America, and so it comes as a great\nblow to him now. You must be very indulgent towards him for my sake, dear\nfriend.\n\nI am glad we know about those rascally book agents--for many of us are\nwanting a goodish number of copies of the new edition & it is important\nto understand we may have them straight from you. Rossetti is making a\nlist of the friends & the number, so that they may all come together.\n\nPerhaps, dearest friend, you may be having a great difficulty in getting\nthe books out for want of funds--if so, let me help a little--show your\ntrust in me and my love thus generously.\n\n  Your own loving\n  ANNIE.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  March 11, '76._\n\nI have had such joy this morning, my Darling--Poems of yours given in the\n_Daily News_--sublime Poems one of them reaching dizzy heights, filling my\nsoul with strong delight. These prefaced by a few words, timid enough yet\nkindly in tone, & better than nothing. The days, the weeks, are slipping\nby, my beloved, bearing me swiftly, surely to you--before the beauty of\nthe year begins to fade we shall come. The young folk too are full of\nbright anticipation & eagerness now, I am thankful to say; and Percy\ngetting on with, I trust, such near & definite prospect of his happiness\nthat he will be able to pull along cheerily towards it after we are gone,\nin spite of loneliness.\n\nI expect, Darling, we must go to some little town or village ten or twenty\nmiles short of Philadelphia till the tremendous influx of visitors to the\nCentennial has ceased, else we shall not be able to find a corner\nthere.--By the bye, I feel a little sulky at your always taking a fling at\nthe poor piano. I see I have got to try & show you it too is capable of\nwaking deep chords in the human soul when it is the vehicle of a great\nmaster's thought & emotions--if only my poor fingers prove equal to the\ntask! (All my heart shall go into them.) Take from my picture a long, long\nlook of tender love and joy and faith, deathless, ever young, ever\ngrowing, ever learning, aspiring love, tender, cherishing, domestic love.\n\nOh, may I be full of sweet comfort for my Beloved's Soul and Body through\nlife, through and after death.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXIV\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  _Camden, New Jersey\n  March, 1876._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nTo your good & comforting letter of Feb. 25th I at once answer, at least\nwith a few lines. I have already written this morning a pretty full letter\nto Mr. Rossetti (to answer one just rec'd from him) & requested him to\nloan it you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully &\ncandidly.\n\nMy new edition is printed & ready. Upon receipt of your letter I sent you\na set, two Vols. (by Mail, March 15) which you must have rec'd by this\ntime. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.\n\nMy health, I am encouraged to think, is perhaps a shade better--certainly\nas well as any time of late.\n\nI even already vaguely contemplate plans (they may never be fulfilled, but\nyet again they may) of changes, journeys--even of coming to London &\nseeing you, visiting my friends, &c. My dearest friend, _I do not approve\nyour American trans-settlement. I see so many things here you have no idea\nof--the social, and almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, here\n(at least in appearance)._\n\n_Don't do anything towards it nor resolve in it nor make any move at all\nin it without further advice from me. If I should get well enough to\nvoyage, we will talk about it yet in London._\n\nYou must not be uneasy about me--dearest friend, I get along much better\nthan you think for. As to the literary situation here, my rejection by the\ncoteries and the poverty (which is the least of my troubles), am not sure\nbut I enjoy them all--besides, as to the latter, I am not in want.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd., London\n  March 30, '76._\n\nYesterday _was_ a day for me, dearest Friend. In the morning your letter,\nstrong, cheerful, reassuring--dear letter. In the afternoon the books. I\ndon't know how to settle down my thoughts calmly enough to write, nor how\nto lay down the books (with delicate yet serviceable exterior, with\ninscription making me so proud, so joyous). But there are a few things I\nwant to say to you at once in regard to our coming to America. I will not\nact without \"further advice from you\"; but as to not resolving on it, dear\nfriend, I can't exactly obey that, for it has been my settled, steady\npurpose (resting on a deep, strong faith) ever since 1869. Nor do I feel\ndiscouraged or surprised at what you say of American \"crudeness,\" &c. (of\nwhich, in truth, one hears not a little in England). I have not shut my\neyes to the difficulties and trials & responsibilities (for the children's\nsake) of the enterprise. I am not urged on by any discontent with old\nEngland or by any adverse circumstances here which I might hope to better\nthere: my reasons, emotions, the sources of my strength and courage for\nthe uprooting & transplanting--all are inclosed in those two volumes that\nlie before me on the table. That America has brought them forth makes me\nwant to plant some, at least, of my children on her soil. I understand &\nbelieve in & love her in & through them. They teach me to look beneath\nthe surface & to get hints of the great future that is shaping itself out\nof the crude present, & I believe we shall prove to be of the right sort\nto plant down there.--O to talk it all over with you, dearest Friend, here\nin London first; I feel as if that would really be--the joy, the comfort,\nof that. I cannot finish this to-day but send what I have written without\ndelay that you may know of the safe arrival of the books. With reverent,\ngrateful love from us all.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd. London\n  April 21, 1876._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI must write again, out of a full heart. For the reading of this book,\n\"The Two Rivulets,\" has filled it very full. Ever the deep inward assent,\nrising up strong, exultant my immortal self recognizing, responding to\nyour immortal self. Ever the sense of dearness, the sweet, subtle perfume,\npervading every page, every line, to my sense--O I cannot put into any\nwords what I perceive nor what answering emotion pervades me, flows out\ntowards you--sweetest, deepest, greatest experience of my life--what I was\nmade for--surely I was made as the soil in which the precious seed of your\nthoughts & emotions should be planted--try to fulfil themselves in me,\nthat I might by & bye blossom into beauty & bring forth rich\nfruits--immortal fruits. So no doubt other women feel, and future women\nwill.\n\nDo not dissuade me from coming this autumn, my dearest Friend. I have\nwaited patiently--7 years--patiently, yet often, especially since your\nillness, with such painful yearning your heart would yearn towards me if\nyou realized it--I cannot wait any longer. Nor ought I to--that would\nindeed be sacrificing the prudence that concerns itself with immortal\nthings to the prudence that concerns itself only with temporary ones. But,\nindeed, even so far as this latter is concerned, there is no sacrifice\nfor any. It is by far the best step, for instance, I could take on\nBeatrice's account. She is heartily in earnest in her medical studies. I\nam persuaded, too, it is a splendid training for her whether or no she\never makes a money-earning profession of it. And in England women have at\npresent no means of obtaining a complete medical education. They cannot\nget admission to any Hospital for the clinical part of the course. So that\nshe is exceedingly anxious to come where it is possible for her to follow\nout her aims effectually. Then, I am confident she will find America\ncongenial to her--that she is in her essential nature democratic--& that\nshe has the intelligence, the sympathies, earnestness, affectionateness,\nunconventionality needed to pierce through appearances surface \"crudeness\"\n& see & love the great reality unfolding below. So I believe has Herby.\nThen an artist is as free as an author to work where he pleases & reaps as\nmuch from fresh and widened experiences. He does not contemplate cutting\nhimself off from England--will exhibit here--very likely take a studio in\nLondon for a season, a couple of years hence to work among old friends &\nassociations & so have double chance & opportunities. Then above all,\ndearest friend, they too see America in & through you--they too would fain\nbe near you. Have no anxiety or misgivings for us. Let us come & be near\nyou--& see if we are made of the right sort of stuff for transplanting to\nAmerican soil. Only advise us where. If it be Philadelphia (which as far\nas offering facilities for Beatrice would, as far as I can learn, suit us\nvery well). We must not come, I think, till the end of October, because of\nits being so full. Perhaps indeed, dearest Friend (but dare not build on\nit) we shall talk this over in England. If you are able to take the\njourney, it might, and would, be sure to do you good as well as to rejoice\nthe hearts of English friends. But if not, if we are not able to talk over\nour coming, do not feel the least anxious about us. We shall light on our\nfeet & do very well. Percy seems getting on fairly well, considering what\na bad time it is in his line of business. I think he will be able to marry\nthis autumn or following winter. I shall go and spend a month with him in\nJuly. Perhaps, indeed, if, as many are prophecying, the iron trade does\nnot recover its old pre-eminence here, he may be glad by & bye that I have\ngone over to America & opened a way for him. But if he does not follow me\nthen, if I live, I hope to spend a few months with him every three or four\nyears, instead of as now a few weeks once a year. Anyhow we have to live\nwidely apart. Thanks for the papers just received. Specially welcome the\naccount of some stranger's interview with you--for me too before very long\nnow the joy of hearing the \"strong musical voice\" read the \"Wound Dresser\"\nor speak.\n\nI have happy thoughts for my companions all day long, helping me over\nevery difficulty--strengthening me. Good-bye, dearest Friend. Love from us\nall.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Torriano Gardens\n  Camden Rd., London\n  May 18, 1876._\n\nJust a line of birthday greeting, my dearest Friend. May it find you\nenjoying the beautiful spring-time & the grand sights of people & products\n& the music at Philadelphia, notwithstanding drawbacks (but lessening\ndrawbacks, I earnestly hope) of health, lameness. Rejoiced, too, perhaps\nwith the sight of many dear old friends occasion has brought to your city.\nMay all that will do you good come, my dearest Friend. And not least the\nsense of relief & joy in having fulfilled the great task, in the teeth of\nsuch difficulties relaunched safely, more fully, richly equipt, the ship\nto sail down the great ocean of Time, bearing precious, precious freight\nof seed to be planted in countless successions of human souls, helping\nforward more than even the best lovers of your poems dream, the great\nfuture of humanity. That is what I believe as surely as I believe in my\nown existence.\n\nThe \"low star,\" the great star drooping low in the west, has been\nunusually resplendent of a night here lately & by day lilacs & the\nlabernums wonderfully brightening dear old smoky London, constant\nreminders all, if I needed any, of the Poet & the Poems, so dear to me.\n\nIf I do not hear from you to the contrary I am to take our passage by one\nof the \"States\" Line of Steamers that come straight to Philadelphia\nsailing about the 1st Sept.--& I am told one ought to secure one's cabin a\ncouple of months or so beforehand. But if there be indeed an increasing\nhope of your coming here in the course of the summer, or if you think it\nwould be best for us to go to New York (only I want to go at once where we\nare likely to stop, because of my furniture), let me hear as soon as may\nbe, dear Friend. Looking at it purely as concerns the young ones, for some\nreasons it is very desirable to come this year & for others to wait till\nnext. With Bee, for instance, we are both losing time & wasting money by\ngoing over another winter here when there is no complete & satisfactory\nmedical course to be had. Then as regards dear Percy, he writes me now\nthat though he is doing fairly well, he does not think he will be able to\ntake a house & marry till next summer--& that I am very sorry for. But\nthen I think that as I could not be with him nor help him forward, the\nbalance goes down on Beatrice's side, if I am able to accomplish it.\n\nGood-bye, my dearest Friend. Loving, tender thoughts shall I send you on\nthe 30th. Solemn thoughts outleaping life, immortal aspirations of my soul\ntoward your soul. The children's love too, please, dearest Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Round Hill, Northampton, Mass.\n  Monday, Sept., '77._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI have had joyful news to-day! Percy's wife has a fine little boy--it was\nborn on the 10th, and Norah got through well & is doing nicely; so I feel\nvery happy.\n\nSince then Per. has gone to Paris where he is to read a paper before the\n\"Iron and Steel Institute\" on the Elimination of phosphorus from\nIron--which is also a little triumph of another kind for him--for the\nCouncil which accepted his paper is composed of eminent English\nscientists, & eminent foreign ones will hear it.--I need not tell you it\nis indescribably lovely here now--no doubt Kirkwood is the same--the light\nso brilliant, and yet soft--the rich autumn tints just beginning to\nappear--the temperature delicious--crisp & bracing, yet genial.\n\nThe throng of people is gone--but a few of the pleasantest of the old set\nremain--& a few interesting new ones have come!--among them Mrs. Dexter\nfrom Boston, who was a Miss Ticnor, daughter of the author of the book on\nSpanish literature--she and her husband full of interesting talk. Also Mr.\nMartin B---- and his wife--a fine specimen of a leading Bostonian. Besides\nthese also a physician from Florida whom I much admire--with a beautiful\nfirm tenor voice--very handsome & graceful too, a true southerner, I\nshould say--(but of Scotch extraction).\n\nNext week we go to Boston.\n\nI went over the Lunatic Asylum here the other day & saw some strange, sad\nsights--some figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection\nI shall never forget them--some very bright and talkative. It is said to\nbe the best managed in America. Dr. Earle, who is at the head, is a man of\nsplendid capacity for the post--a noble-looking old man (uncle of those\nMiss Chases you met at our house).\n\nI can't settle to anything or think of any thing since I received Percy's\nletter but the baby & Norah. Love to you & to Mrs. Whitman[25] &\nHattie[26] & Jessie.[27]\n\nGood-bye, dear Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXIX\n\nBEATRICE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _New England Hospital\n  Codman Avenue\n  Boston Highlands_\n\nDEAR WALT:\n\nHospital life is beginning to seem a long-accustomed life. I enjoy all the\nduties involved & all the human relations. Even getting up in the night is\ncompensated for by yielding a sense of importance & independence. I sleep\nin a large room with three windows, & three beds in a row. Breakfast at 7,\n& we are supposed to have seen all our patients before breakfast, but do\nnot keep to that rule.\n\nAfter breakfast, round to count pulses & respirations, note condition,\ndress any wound, in charge, etc. At 1/2 past 8 o'clock go the rounds with\nthe resident physician (Dr. Berlin), all the students, & superintendent of\nnurses. Then put up medicine, each for her own patients (about 8 in no.),\ngive electricity, etc. If one's patient has an ache or pain, the nurse\nwhistles for the student (my whistle is 2). She sees the patient orders\nwhat is necessary, or if serious reports to Dr. Berlin. Then there is some\nmicroscopic work, & copying out the history & daily record of the case &\nmaking out the temperature charts more than fills in the day. At 8 o'clock\nwe all in conclave report about our patients & talk over any interesting\ncase. One of my patients has empyema following pleurisy. I inject into her\nchest about a doz. of different preparations. Several of my patients (I\nhave all the very sick just now) require very careful watching.\n\nIn the evening we go round again & count pulses & respirations & note\ntemperatures. If a very sick patient, in the middle of the day; also take\npulse, etc. The number of visits depending on the need & the competency of\nthe nurse. I like introducing lint into wounds (such simple ones as an\nincised abscess of the breast) with the probe, because if I take trouble\nenough I can do it without hurting the patient, much to the patient's\nsurprise.\n\nThe other day Mr. & Mrs. Marvin called to see me with Mrs. & Miss\nCallender--I enjoyed their visit much. To-day Mr. Marvin drove over to\nfetch me to lunch, & I had a beautiful drive over to Dorchester; in the\nafternoon a game of lawn tennis, a stroll down to the creek, & drive home\nby Forest Hill Cemetery & Jamaica Pond. The air was fresh after a shower &\ngolden-tinted, & the drive through beautiful lanes & country. All were\nfriendly & it was refreshing to emerge from the little hospital world. Mr.\nMarvin's cordial face greeted me when I was speaking to some patients in\nhammocks, under the trees, the day he called, much to my surprise.\n\nI was to-day feeling the need of a little change of air & scene, so that\nthe visit was most opportune.\n\nMr. Morse[28] is working away desperately at the bust of you; he feels as\nif he would get on famously if he could only catch a glimpse of you. Now\nmight not you come to Boston on your way to Chesterfield, ride up in the\nopen horsecars (a very pleasant ride) to see me also and give Mr. Morse\nthe benefit of a sitting? How I wish we could get Mrs. Stafford in here;\nthe patients get most excellent care. I have great confidence in Dr.\nBerlin & in the attending physician. I do not want her to come for a\nmonth, because Dr. Berlin has just gone away for a vacation.\n\nI fear no mere visiting once a day of a doctor will do her any good--she\nneeds hygienic treatment--massage (a woman works here every day on the\npatients who need rubbing & massage), feeding up (I have never yet seen a\npatient whom we could not make eat, appetite or not, by aid of beef-tea &\nmilk), perfect rest, & judicious treatment.\n\nDr. Berlin is a learned, charming woman of 28--she takes advanced views,\ngives no medicine at all in some cases, & if any, few at a time, but\nefficient. She is perfectly unaffected, very intelligent, & has been\nthoroughly trained. She is a Russian.\n\nPlease give my love to Mrs. Whitman & remember me to Colonel Whitman. This\nafternoon, when driving with Mr. Marvin, I thought of the pleasant drives\nI have had with Colonel Whitman.\n\n  Yours affectionately,\n  BEATRICE C. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nIf it were not for records accumulating mountain high I should have time\nto write to my friends.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XL\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Sept. 3, '78.\n  Chesterfield, Mass._\n\n  I am half afraid Herby has got a malarious place by his description.\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI had a lingering hope--till Herby went south again--that I should have a\nletter from you, in answer to mine, saying you were coming up to see us\nhere. In truth, it was a great disappointment to me, his going back to\nPhiladelphia instead of your joining us, or him, either here or somewhere\nnear to New York. I wonder where that North Amboyna is that you once\nmentioned to me--and what kind of a place it is. I have had a long, quiet\ntime here, and have enjoyed it very much--never did I breathe such sweet,\nlight, pure air as is always blowing freely over these rocky hills. Rocky\nas they are--and their sides & ravines are strewn with huge boulders of\nevery conceivable size & shape--they nourish an abundant growth of woods,\nand I fancy the farmers here do a great deal better with their winter\ncrops of lumber and bark and maple sugar than with their summer one of\ngrain & corn. I expect Herby has described our neighbours to\nyou--specially Levi Bryant, the father of my hostess--a farmer who lives\njust opposite and has put such heart & soul and muscle & sinew into his\nfarming that he has continued to win quite a handsome competence from this\nbarren soil (it isn't muscle & industry only that are wanted here--but\npluck and endurance) hauling his timber up & down over the snow & through\nthe drifts, along roads that are pretty nearly vertical. I am never tired\nof hearing his stories (nor he of telling them) of hairbreadth escapes for\nhim & his cattle--when the harness or the shafts have broken under the\ntremendous strain--& nothing but coolness & daring have got him or them\nout of it alive. Generally, as he sits talking, his little boy of eleven\nwho bids fair to be like him and can now manage a team or a yoke of oxen\nas well as any man in the parish--and work almost as hard--sits close by\nhim leaning his head on his father's shoulder or breast--for the rugged\nold fellow has a vein of great gentleness and affectionateness in him & I\nnotice the child nestles up to him always rather than to the mother--who\nis all the same a very kind, amiable, good mother. Then there are\nneighbours of another sort up at the \"Centre\"--Mr. Chadwick, &c., from New\nYork, with whom I have pleasant chats daily when I trudge up to fetch my\nletters--now & then I get a delightful drive or go on a blackberrying\nparty with the folks round--I expect Giddy over to-day & we shall remain\nhere together for about a fortnight--then back to Round Hill--where I am\nto meet the Miss Chase whom you may remember taking tea with &\nliking--then on to Boston to see dear Bee--& then to New York, where we\nshall meet again at last, I hope ere long. Love to Mr. & Mrs. Whitman--I\nenjoy her letters. Also to Hattie & Jessie--who will hear from me by &\nbye. With love to you, dear Friend.\n\n  Good-bye.\n  A. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Concord, Mass.\n  Oct. 25th._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe days are slipping away so pleasantly here that weeks are gone before I\nknow it. The Concord folk are as friendly as they are intellectual, and\nthere is really no end to the kindness received. We are rowed on the\nbeautiful river every day that it is warm enough--a very winding river not\nmuch broader than your favourite creek--flowing sometimes through level\nmeadows, sometimes round rocky promontories & steep wooded hills which,\nwith their wonderful autumn tints, are like a gay flower border mirrored\nin the water. Never in my life have I enjoyed outdoor pleasures more--I\nhardly think, so much--enhanced as they are by the companionship of very\nlovable men and women. They lead an easy-going life here--seem to spend\nhalf their time floating about on the river--or meeting in the evening to\ntalk & read aloud. Judge Hoar says it is a good place to live and die in,\nbut a very bad place to make a living in. Beatrice spent one Sunday with\nus here. We walked to Hawthorne's old house in the morning, & in the\nafternoon to the \"Old Manse\" and to Sleepy Hollow, most beautiful of last\nresting places. Tuesday we go on to Boston for a week very loth to leave\nConcord--at least, I am!--but Giddy begins to long for city life again.\nAnd then to New York about the 5th Nov. Herby told you, no doubt, that I\nspent an hour or two with Emerson--and that he looked very beautiful--and\ntalked in a friendly, pleasant manner. A long letter from my sister in\nEngland tells me Per. looks well and happy & is so proud of his little\nboy--and that Norah is really a perfect wife to him--affectionate,\ndevoted, and the best of housewives. How glad I am Herby is painting you.\nI wonder if you like the landscape he is working on as well as you did\n\"Timber Creek.\" Miss Hillard has undertaken the charge of a young lady's\neducation, and is very much pleased with her task. She is in a delightful\nfamily who make her quite one with them--live in the best part of New\nYork, and pay her a handsome salary. She has the afternoons and Saturday &\nSunday to herself.--Concord boasts of having been first to recognize your\ngenius. Mr. Alcott & Mr. Sanborn say so. Good-bye, dear Friend.\n\nA. G.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _39 Somerset St.\n  Boston\n  Nov. 13, '78._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI feel as if I didn't a bit deserve the glorious budget you sent me\nyesterday, for I have been a laggard, dull correspondent of late, because,\nleading such an unsettled kind of life, I don't seem to have got well hold\nof myself. Beautiful is the title prose poem--the glimpse of the autumn\ncornfield: one smells the sweet fragrance, basks in the sunshine with\nyou--tastes all the varied, subtle outdoor pleasures, just as you want us\nto. A lady who has just been calling on me--Miss Hillard--no relation of\nthe odious Dr. H.--said, \"Have you seen a lovely little bit about a\ncornfield by Walt Whitman in a New York paper?\" She did not know your\npoems, but was so taken with this. By the bye, I am not quite American\nenough yet to enjoy the sound of the locusts & big grasshoppers--ours are\nmodest little things that only make a gentle sort of whirr--not that loud\nbrassy sound--couldn't help wishing for more birds & less insects when I\nwas at Chesterfield--but I like our English name \"ladybird\" better than\n\"ladybug\". Do your children always say when they see one, as ours do,\n\"Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home: your house is on fire, your children\nare flown\"? But for the rest--I believe I am growing a very good American;\nindeed, certain am I there is no more lovable people to live amongst\nanywhere in the world--and in this respect it has been good to give up\nhaving a home of my own here for awhile--for I have been thrown amongst\nmany more intimately than I could have been otherwise. What you say of\nHerby's picture delights me, dear Friend. I have been grieving he was not\nwith us, sharing the pleasant times we have had and enlarging his circle\nof friends--but after all he could not have been doing better--he must\ncome on here by & bye. I wonder if you are as satisfied with his portrait\nof you as with the landscape. I suppose he is gone on to New York to-day.\nI have sighed for dear little Concord many times since I came\naway--beautiful city as Boston is & many the interesting & kindly people I\nam seeing here: but the outdoor life & the entirely simple, unpretending,\ncordial, friendly ways of Concord & its inhabitants won my heart\naltogether--one of them came to see me to-day & to ask us to go and spend\na couple of days with them there again before we leave & I could not say\nnay, though our time is short. There are some portraits in the Art Museum\nhere, which interested me a good deal--of Adams, Hancock, Quincy, &c.,--&\nof some of the women of that time--they would form an excellent nucleus of\na national portrait gallery, which (together with good biographies while\nyet materials & recollections are fresh & abundant) would be a very\ninteresting & important contribution to the world's history.--Tennyson's\nletter is a pleasure to me to see--considering his age & the imperfection\nof his sight through life, matters are better rather than worse with him\nthan one could have expected. Since that was written a friend (Walter\nWhite) tells me they--the Tennysons--have taken a house in Eaton Sq.,\nLondon, for the winter. And last, not least, thanks for Mr. Burroughs's\nbeautiful letter--that young man is indeed, as he says, like a bit out of\nyour poems.\n\nThere are two or three fine young men boarding here, & Giddy & I enjoy\ntheir society not a little. Love to your Brothers & Sister. I shall write\nsoon as I am settled down in New York to her or Hattie. Love to Mrs.\nStafford. And most of all to you.\n\nGood-bye, dear friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nI will send T's letter in a day or two.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _112 Madison Ave.\n  New York\n  Jan. 5, '79._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nHerby has told you of our difficulties in getting comfortable quarters\nhere--and also that we seem now to have succeeded--not indeed in the way I\nmost wished & hoped we had--in 19th St., taking rooms & boarding\nourselves--so that we could have a friend with us when & as we pleased. It\nseems as if that were not practicable unless we were to furnish for\nourselves. Certainly our experiences there of using another's kitchen were\ndiscouraging--it was so dirty and uncomfortable that we were glad to take\nrefuge in a regular boarding house again before one week was out. It seems\nto me more difficult to get anything of a medium kind in New York than\nelsewhere I have been--if it isn't the best, it is very uninviting indeed.\nHerby is enjoying his work and companionship at the League very much. We\nstand the cold well--how does it suit you? Is your arm free from rheumatic\npains? When you come to Mr. J. H. Johnstons, which will be very soon I\nhope, we shall be quite handy, and have a pretty, sunny room--a sitting\nroom by day!--with a handsome piece of furniture which is metamorphosed\ninto a bed at night--and a large dressing closet with hot & cold water\nadjoining--all very comfortable. O how wistfully do I think of one evening\nin Philadelphia, last winter. I shan't begin really to like New York till\nyou come and we have had some chats together. I have news from England\nwhich makes me rather anxious. The Blaenavon Co., to which Per. is\nchemist, has gone into liquidation--& I don't know whether it will\ncontinue to exist--or how soon in these dull times he may find a good\nopening elsewhere. Should things go badly for him, either Giddy and I will\nreturn to England to share [our] home with him there, or else I want him\nto take into serious consideration coming out here, instead of our going\nback. Of course it would be a risky thing for him to do with wife & child,\nin these times, unless some definite opening presented itself, but I\ncannot help thinking that, being an expert in his profession, with first\nrate training & experience, and iron work & metallurgy promising here to\nhave such enormous developments, he would be sure to do well in the end;\nand meanwhile we could rub on together somehow. However, we shall see. I\nhave laid the matter before him, he & his dear little wife wrote me a very\nbrave, cheery letter when they told me the bad news--& I shall have an\nanswer to mine, I suppose, by the end of the month. Kate Hillard read an\namusing paper on Swinburne at a meeting of the Woman's Club in Brooklyn--&\nwe had some fine music too. For the rest, I have not yet presented any\nintroductions here.\n\nHave had some beautiful glimpses of the North & East River effects of the\nshipping at sunset, &c.--Have subscribed to the Mercantile library,--& are\nbeginning to feel at home. Herby & Giddy had been to hear Mr. Frothingham\nthis morning, & were much interested. Bee missed us sorely at first--but\nwrites--when she does write, which is but seldom--pretty cheerily.\nFriendly remembrance to your brother & sister. I wonder where Hattie &\nJessie are spending their holidays. Love from us all. Good-bye, dear\nfriend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nHad a letter from Mr. Marvin--all well--he is doing the Washington letter\nof a N. Eng. paper. Hopes & trusts you are really going to Washington.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLIV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _112 Madison Ave.\n  14 Jan., '79._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe pleasantest event since I last wrote has been a visit from Mr.\nEldridge. We had a long, friendly chat that did me good. Saturday evening\nwe went to one of Miss Booth's receptions--met Joaquin Miller there, who\nis just back from Europe--of course we talked of you. Mrs. Moulton too is\nhoping so you will come to New York during her stay here, which is to last\na week or two longer. John Burroughs has just sent me a post card to say\nhe has returned from a 3-weeks stay with his folks in Delaware Co.--that\nhe hopes to come here soon--wants Mrs. Burroughs to come too & board for a\nmonth or so--wants also \"Walt to come--& lecture\"--but \"Walt will not be\nhurried.\" Did I tell you that we found boarding here a young man, Mr.\nArthur Holland, one of the family who were so very friendly to me & made\nmy stay so pleasant both in Concord & Cambridge? He often comes to our\nroom of an evening for an hour or two's chat, & by the bye, being\nconnected with the iron trade he has been able to make some enquiries for\nme as to what Per's chances as a scientific metallurgist would be in this\ncountry--& I am sorry to say he thinks they would be very poor indeed.\nProf. Lesley said the same thing; so it is clear I must not urge him to\ntry the experiment, seeing he has a wife & child. Herby & Giddy both well.\nLove from us all. Good bye, Dear Friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nFriendly greeting to your brother & sister.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _112 Madison Ave.,\n  Jan. 27, '79._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nAre you never coming? I do long & long to see you. I am beginning to like\nNew York better than I did and to have pleasant times. Had some friendly\nchats with Kate Hillard last week, & went with her to call on Mrs. Putman\nJacobi, who has a little baby 3 weeks old & is still in her room, but has\ngot through very nicely--She talks well, doesn't she? & has a face with\nplenty of individuality in it. Also we went together on Saturday again to\none of Miss Booth's receptions, & there met Mrs. Croly, & had the best\ntalk about you I have had this long while. I like her cordiality--we are\ngoing to her reception on Sunday & to one at Mrs. Bigelow's Wednesday. It\nis true there is not much that can be called social enjoyment at these\ncrowded receptions, but they enable you to start many acquaintanceships,\nsome of which turn out lasting good. We had some fine harp playing & a\nwitty recital at Miss Booth's. Miss Selous is back in America. I should\nnot wonder if she comes on here soon. Bee is living at the Dispensary now,\ninstead of in the Hospital, & finds the comparatively outdoor life--& the\nfreedom from being \"whistled\" for all hours of the day and night as she\nwas there--a wonderful refreshment. That coloured lady, Mrs. Wiley, whom\nyou met once at our house, is her fellow labourer & room mate at the\nDispensary. Bee likes her much. I am not sure whether you know the\nGilders? We spent a couple of hours delightfully with them yesterday\nafternoon. She has a very attractive face, a musical voice, & such a sweet\nsmile. They are going to Europe for a four months' holiday this spring. I\nadmire the simple, unconventional way in which they live. Herby is working\naway in the best spirits. He is going to paint that bowling alley subject\non a large scale. Giddy is sitting by me with her nose in the French\nDictionary, working away at a novel of Balzac's. I have had scarcely any\nletters from England lately!--and the papers bring none but dismal\ntidings; nevertheless I don't believe our sun is going down yet awhile--we\nshall emerge from this dark crisis the better, not the worse, because\ncompelled to grapple with the evils that have caused it, instead of\npassively enduring them. Please give friendly remembrance from me to your\nbrothers & sister. Have you been at Kirkwood lately, I wonder? I suppose\nTimber Creek is frozen over. Good-bye, dear Friend. Write soon, or better\nstill Come!\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLVI\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _New York\n  112 Madison Avenue\n  February 2nd, 1879._\n\nDEAR DARLING WALT:\n\nI read your long piece in the Philadelphia _Times_ with ever so much\ninterest, & with especial delight the delicately told bit about the dear\nold Pond, artistic, because so true. I know that it will please you to\nhear that I have gained tenfold facility with my brush since the autumn.\nIt has agreed uncommonly well with me having enlisted under such an\nexperienced & able painter as Chase; as a manipulator of the brush he is\nagreed by the experts (Eaton) to have no rival. I may yet be able to paint\na head of you in _one_ sitting that will do justice to you. Three of my\npictures are nicely hung at the Water Colour Exhibition Academy of Design,\nthe first time that I have exhibited in New York. We had two & three\nengagements every night (with one exception) last week, & go to Mrs.\nCroley's to-night. Your friend John Burroughs called last Wednesday--came\nto try Turkish baths for his malarious trouble, but it seemed to bring on\nhis attacks of neuralgia worse. I am sorry that I can report but poorly of\nhis health, so painfully excruciating was his neuralgia about his arms at\ntimes that a Dr. was sent for & morphia injected in his wrist, but I am\nglad to say he reported himself a little better. He hopes that you will\ncome and give the lecture on Lincoln this winter; why not, confound it, it\nwould be most interesting.\n\nQuite often we go to Miss Booth's receptions. Saturday evening, they are\ngay & amusing. Met Mr. Bliss, the gentleman that talked like \"a house\nafire\" one Sunday at your house last winter, you remember.\n\nLast Wednesday I, mother, Giddy, & Kate Hillard went to Mrs. Bigelow's\nreception. Miss H. was asked to recite & she recited the \"Swineherd\"\n(Anderson's) charmingly, & \"The Faithful Lovers,\" which took every one.\n\"Walk in\" Miller was there (I can't spell his name) & lots more.\n\nThis morning being Sunday, I took my skates to the Park. The wind was high\n& whirled us about fantastically; ladies seated in wicker chairs were\npushed rapidly along the Pond's smooth icy surface by their gentlemen\nescorts, tall men kissed the ice or sprawled full length on their backs,\nwhile others flew by like swallows; all this with a church spire peeping\nbehind hills dappled with snow & sunshine: what more inspiriting than\nthis?\n\nAnd now dear Walt.\n\nGood-bye for the present.\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLVII\n\nBEATRICE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _33 Warrenton St.\n  Feb. 16, 1879._\n\nDEAR MR. WHITMAN:\n\nAlthough not in word, I have thanked you for your letter & papers by\nenjoying them thoroughly.\n\nDown at this Dispensary we work just as hard as at the Hospital, but our\nspare minutes are our own (no records to write out); our work is under our\nown control; we are out in fresh air half the day, sometimes half the\nnight, making intimate acquaintance with all sorts of people & places &\nwith far distant parts of Boston.\n\nWe have all the responsibility that it is good for young doctors to have,\ni. e., in all difficult or obscure & dangerous cases we are obliged to\ncall in older heads & are obliged to report verbally to the visiting\nphysician of the month all our cases & our treatment. Only two students\nlive at the Dispensary--Dr. Wiley (the coloured Philadelphia student you\nsaw) & myself. In tastes we have much in common & on the whole I prefer to\nlive with her rather than with any of the other students. We share rooms.\nWe have a bedroom, a drug-room, a treatment room, waiting room for\npatients, & take our meals in the kitchen.\n\nA widow woman with two children housekeeps.\n\nI think Boston a very beautiful city. The public Gardens & Commons in the\nbusiest part, sloping down from the gilt domed state house on Beacon\nhill, threaded by paths in all directions, traversed by the business men,\nthe fine ladies, the beggars, etc., etc. One broad, sloping path is given\nup to the boys who want to coast, temporary wooden bridges being thrown\nover the cross paths. Then, crossing South Bay to South Boston is a\nbeautiful walk I take from one to four times a day. South Boston looks\nrather dingy; it is inhabited mostly by artisans & mill hands & fishermen,\nbut walking up 3rd St., as you cross the lettered streets A, B, C, D,\netc., you look down upon the harbour--on bright days bright blue, & a few\nsails to be seen--at sunset the colours of course are reflected\ngorgeously.\n\nSomehow or other the sea looks doubly beautiful set in dingy S. Boston.\n\nFar over in the West End too we have patients. Last Tuesday I had twins\nall by myself; only one, however, was born alive; the other had been dead\na week. How delightful that you are feeling so much better. Shall you not\nbe coming to Boston sometime before I leave, 1st June?\n\nThe Boston I know is not the Boston I knew in books; I am as far off from\nthat as if I lived in England--is not the \"hub\"--I was reminded of that\nlast Sunday when I had time for once to go to church & went to hear Mr. E.\nE. Hale preach and went home to dinner with him....\n\nI like his daughter whom we knew in Philadelphia. She is a clever young\nartist. Dr. Wiley is very popular with her patients, far more so than I.\n\nPlease remember me to all the Staffords & give my especial love to Mrs.\nStafford. Also to Mrs. Whitman.\n\nYours affectionately,\n\nBEATRICE C. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLVIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _112 Madison Ave.\n  March 18, 1879._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI hope you are enjoying this splendid, sunshiny weather as much as we\nare--the atmosphere here is delicious. In the morning Giddy and I set at\nhome busy with needle work, letter writing, and reading. After lunch we go\nout for a walk or to pay visits--and of an evening very often to\nreceptions (but they are not half so jolly as our evenings at\nPhiladelphia). Still we have a lively, pleasant time. I like Miss Booth\nvery much, with her kindly, generous character and active practical mind.\nSo I do Mrs. Croly--she is more impulsive and enthusiastic. Kate Hillard\noften goes with us, & she is always good company. I had a note from Edward\nCarpenter the other day brought by a lady who had been living near him at\nSheffield--an American lady with two very fine little girls who has lately\nlost her husband in England and was on her way back to her parents' home\nin Pennsylvania--somewhere beyond Pittsburg. She is one who loves your\npoems, & has great hopes of seeing you in New York. She told me her little\ngirls were so fond of Carpenter he of them--he is first rate with\nchildren. I hope you will not put off coming to New York till we are\nreturning to Philadelphia, which will be some time in May. I find Beatrice\nis so anxious to get further advantages for study in England or Paris\nbefore she begins to practise, and Herby is so strongly advised by Mr.\nEaton, of whose judgment & experience he thinks very highly, to study in\nDuron's Studio in Paris for a year, that I have made up my mind to go\nback, for a time at any rate, this summer; but I shall leave my furniture\nhere, and the question of where our future home is to be, open. Herby is\nmaking great progress. I wish you could see the head of an old woman he\nhas just painted--and I wish he had had as much power when he had such\nsplendid chances of painting you. I cannot tell you how vividly and\npleasantly Chestnut St. on a sunny day rose before me in your jottings.\nLove from us all. Tell your sister I often think of her & shall enjoy a\nchat ever so.\n\nA. G.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XLIX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _112 Madison Ave.\n  March 26, '79._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nIt seems quite a long while since I wrote, & a _very long_ while since you\nwrote. I am beginning to turn my thoughts Philadelphia-wards that we may\nhave some weeks near you before we set out on fresh wanderings across the\nsea; and though I feel quite cheery about them, I look eagerly forward to\nthe time beyond that when we have a fixed, final nest of our own again,\nwhere we can welcome you just when and as you please. Whichever side the\nAtlantic it is, you will come surely? for you belong to the one country as\nmuch as to the other. And I shall always feel that I do too. I take back\nwith me a deep and hearty love for America--I came indeed with a good deal\nof that, but what I take back is different--stronger, more real. I went\nover to see friends in Brooklyn yesterday, & it was more lovely than I can\ntell you on the Ferry--in fact, it was just your poem, \"Crossing Brooklyn\nFerry\". Herby still painting away _con amore_, & making good progress. I\nmet Joaquin Miller at the Bigelows last week, & he was very pleasant\n(which isn't always the case) and said some very good things to me.\nThursday we are going to lunch with Mrs. Albert Brown--perhaps you may\nhave heard of her as Bessie Griffiths. She was a Southern lady who, when\nshe was about 18, freed all her slaves & left herself penniless. On Sunday\nwe take tea at Prof. Rood's of Columbia College. Kate Hillard we often\nsee & have lively chats with. We meet also & see a good deal of General\nEdward Lee--a fine soldierly looking man, & I believe he distinguished\nhimself in the war & was afterwards sent to organize the new Territory of\nWyoming, & was the first governor. I wish very much that if you or your\nbrother knew him or know anything about him, you would tell me--for\nreasons that I will tell you by & bye. Bee is seeing a great deal of the\neducated coloured people at Boston--was at the meeting of a literary\nclub--the only white among 20 or 30 coloured ladies--likes them much.\n\nWrite soon, dear Friend. Meanwhile, best love & good-bye.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nNo letters from England this long while.\n\nPlease give friendly greetings from me to your brother & sister.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER L\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Glasgow\n  Friday, June 20, 1879._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nWe set foot on dry land again Wednesday morning after a good passage--not\na very smooth one--and not without four or five days of seasickness, but\nafter that we really enjoyed the sea & the sky--it was mostly cloudy, but\nsuch lovely lights and shades & invigorating breezes! and as we got up\ninto northern latitudes, daylight in the sky all night through. The last\nthree days we had glorious scenery--sailed close in under the Giant's\nCauseway on the north coast of Ireland--great sort of natural ramparts &\nbastions or rock, wonderfully grand. Then we sailed on Lough Fozle to land\na group of Irish folk at Moville--some of them old people who had not seen\nIreland for forty years, and who were so happy they did not know what to\ndo with themselves. And what with this human interest, and the first\ngetting near land again and the rich green-and-golden gorse-covered hills\n& the setting sun streaming along the beautiful lough with golden light,\nit was a sight & a time I shall never forget. Then we entered the Firth of\nClyde & sailed among the islands--mountainous Arran, level Bute--& on the\nother hand the green hills of Ayr, with pleasant towns nestled under them,\nsloping to the Clyde--this was during the night--we did not go to bed at\nall it was so beautiful--& then came a gorgeous sunrise--& then the\nlanding at Greenock & a short railway journey to Glasgow, the tide not\nserving to bring our big ship up so far. We had very pleasant (& learned\nwithal) companions on the voyage--the Professor of Greek & of Philosophy\nfrom Harvard and a young student from Concord, all of whom we have seen\nsince we landed and hope to see often again, especially the young student,\nFrank Bigelow, who is a very nice fellow. Herby enjoyed the voyage much &\nso did Giddy. Glasgow is a great, solidly built city, very pleasant [in]\nspite of smoky atmosphere--full of sturdy, rosy-cheeked people with broad\nScotch accent. We have been rushing about shopping--have not yet seen\nPer.--shall meet him at Durham in a week's time & spend a month together\nthere where he will be superintending your works. Meanwhile we are going\nto Edinburgh for a few days. I kept thinking of you on the voyage, dear\nfriend, & wondering how you would like it--& whether you could stand being\nstowed away in the little box-like berth at night. I should recommend any\nAmerican friend coming over to try this line--we had a fine ship--fine\nofficers & crew--& the latter part, fine scenery. Love to your Brother &\nSister & to Mr. Burroughs. Address to me for the present.\n\n  Care Percy C. Gilchrist\n  Blaenavon\n  Poutzpool\n  Mon.\n\nLove from us all. I shall write soon again. Good-bye dear Friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Lower Shincliffe\n  Durham\n  August 2d, '79._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI am sitting in my room with my dear little grandson, the sweetest little\nfellow you ever saw, asleep beside me. Giddy and Norah (my 3d daughter)\nare gone into Durham to do some shopping. Bee is up in London on her way\nto Berne in Switzerland, where she has finally decided to complete her\nmedical studies. Herby is, I think, staying with Eustace Conway at\nHammersmith just now. He has been spending a week at Brighton with Edward\nCarpenter & his family--but I will leave him to tell his own news. We are\nlodging in this little village with its red-tiled roofs & gray stone\nwalls, lying among wooded hills, corn fields, meadows, and collieries on\nthe banks of the Weir, for the sake of being near Percy & his wife. He is\nsuperintending here the erection of some kilns for making the peculiar\nkind of basic firebricks needed in his dephosphorization process. Durham\nCathedral, which was mainly built soon after the Norman conquest, is in\nsight, crowning a wooded hill that rises abruptly from the river-side. It\nlooks as solid, majestic, venerable as the rocks & hills--the interior is\nof wonderful grandeur & beauty. When you enter one of these cathedrals you\nare tempted to say architecture is a lost art with us moderns so far as\nsublimity is concerned--except in vast engineering works. You would not\ndignify the Weir with the name of a river in America--it is no bigger than\nTimber Creek--but it winds about so capriciously through the picturesque\nlittle city as to make almost an island of the hill on which the castle &\ncathedral stand & to need three great solid stone bridges within a quarter\nof a mile of each other, & with its steep wooded sides carrying nature\nright into the heart of the old town. But the rainy season (we have\nscarcely seen the sun since we have been in England & I believe it is the\nsame in France & Italy) and the great depression in trade, especially the\ncoal & iron, which chiefly concerns this district, seem to cast a gloom\nover everything. There are whole rows of colliers' cottages in this\nvillage empty. Where they go to no one knows, but as soon as the\ncollieries reopen they will all reappear. We often meet Colliers returning\nfrom work--they look as if they had just emerged from Hades, poor\nfellows--their faces black as soot--their lean, bowed legs bare--I believe\nthe mines are hot here; they work with little on--but they are really the\ncleanest of all workmen, as they take a bath every night on their return\nbefore supping. The speech here is almost like a foreign tongue to any one\nfrom the south or middle of England. I wonder if you have yet read Dr.\nBucke's book.[29] It is about the only thing I have read since my return.\nIt suggests deeply interesting trains of thought.\n\nI wonder if you are at Camden, taking your daily trips across the ferry &\nstrolls up Chestnut St. I hardly realized till I left it how dearly I love\nAmerica--great sunny land of hope and progress--or how my whole life has\nbeen enriched with the human intercourse I had there. Give my love to\nthose of our friends whom you know & tell them not to forget us. I have\nhad a long letter from Emma Lazarus. I suppose Hattie and Jessie are\nspending their holidays at Camden & that Hattie has pretty well done with\nschool. We have been chiefly busy with needlework since we came--preparing\ndear Bee for Berne. I miss her sadly--had quite hoped we should have all\nbeen together at Paris this winter--but it seems the course is much longer\n& more arduous [there]. We spent a week in Edinburgh before we came on\nhere. It is by far the most beautiful city I have ever seen. The journey\nbetween it and Berwick-on-Tweed lies through the richest & best cultivated\nfarm land in Britain--the sea sparkling on one side of us & these fertile\nfields dotted with splendid flocks & herds--with large comfortable-looking\nfarmhouses, & here & there an old castle; it was singularly enjoyable. How\nI have wished everywhere that you were with us to share the sight--and the\nbest is that you would return home more than ever proud & rejoicing in\nAmerica. It is a land where humanity is having, and is going to have, such\nchances as never before. Giddy sends her love. Mine also & to your brother\n& sister. Good-bye, dear Friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nPlease write soon; I am longing for a letter.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LII[30]\n\nWALT WHITMAN TO ANNE GILCHRIST\n\n\n  _(Camden, New Jersey.)\n  (August, 1879.)_\n\nThank you, dear friend, for your letter; how I should indeed like to see\nthat _Cathedral_[31], I don't know which I should go for first, the\nCathedral or _that baby_.[32] I write in haste, but I am determined you\nshall have a word, at least, promptly in response.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _1 Elm Villas, Elm Row, Heath St.\n  Hampstead, Dec. 5, '79, London, England._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYou could not easily realize the strong emotion with which I read your\nlast note and traced on the little map[33]--a most precious possession\nwhich I would not part with for the whole world--all your\njourneyings--both in youth & now. Mingled emotions! for I cannot but feel\nanxious about your health, & if I didn't know it was very naught to ask\nyou questions, should beg you [to] tell me in what way your health has\nfailed--whether it is the rheumatic & neuralgic affection that troubled\nyou the last spring we were in Philadelphia, or whether the fatigues &\nexcitements & the very enjoyments & full life, & burst of prophetic joy,\nas it were, had proved too great a strain. But you have accomplished\nanother thing, that had to be done in your life & I exult with you--have\nseen the vast magnificent theatre, the free, unfettered conditions whereon\nhumanity will enact a new drama, with the parts all so differently cast!\nthe rest--the moving spirit of it all--hints of this, at least--flashes,\nglimpses, I find in your greatest poems. But, dear Friend, I think\nhumanity moves forward [slowly] even under splendid conditions--you must\ngive it a century or two instead of 50 years--before at least the crowning\nglories of a corresponding literature & art will develope\nthemselves--Nature has got plenty of time before her, & obstinately\nrefuses to be hurried; witness her dealings with the mere rocks & stones.\n\nBee is at Berne, working away merrily, rejoicing in the really splendid\nadvantage for medical study there open to her. She mastered German so as\nto be able to speak & understand it--lectures & all--with ease during the\ntwo months at Wiesbaden & she has found a thoroughly comfortable home with\nsome excellent, intelligent ladies who are fond of her & see to her bodily\nwelfare in every possible way. I have my dear little grandson with me\nhere--as engaging a little toddler as the sun ever shone upon--so\naffectionate & sweet-tempered & bright. I wish I could see him sitting on\nyour knee. You will certainly have to come to us as soon as ever we have a\ncomfortable home, won't you? Giddy is well & as rosy as ever. She & Herby\nsend their love. I have seen Rossetti--he was full of enquiries &\naffectionate interest in all that concerns you--& loth we were to break\noff our conversation & hurry back--but Hampstead, the pleasantest &\nprettiest of all our suburbs, is terribly inaccessible & cuts us off a\ngood deal from the intercourse with old friends I had looked forward to.\nIt is on the top of a high hill (as high as the top of St. Pauls), & looks\ndown on one side over the great city with its canopy of smoke, & on the\nother over a wide, pleasant stretch of green & fertile Middlesex--has\nmoreover pleasant lanes, solid old houses, shaded by big elms, & other\npicturesque features & such an abundance of keen, fresh air this cold\nweather too! We sigh for the warmth of an American house indoors often &\nfor American sunshine out of doors. Rossetti has a beautiful little group\nof children growing up around him--I think the eldest girl will grow up a\nreal beauty & the boy too is a noble little fellow. I meet numbers so\ndelighted to hear about you. I believe Addington Symonds is preparing a\nbook which treats largely of your Poems.\n\nGlad to hear that Brother & Sister & nieces are all well. I wish I could\nwrite to some of them, but what with needlework, an avalanche of letters,\nthe care of my dear little man--the re-editing of my husband's life of\nBlake, to which there will be a considerable addition of letters newly\ncome to light, I hardly know which way to turn. Per. & my nephew & the\n\"Process\" have made a great stride forward. Won two important law suits at\nBerlin, where the Bessemer ring & Krupp at their head were trying to oust\nthem of their patent rights. Also it is practically making good way in\nEngland. So by & bye the money will begin to flow in, I suppose--but has\nnot done so yet.\n\nI trust, dearest Friend, this will find you safe & fairly well again at\nCamden, with plenty of great, happy thoughts to brood over for the winter.\n\nLove from us all. Good-bye.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LIV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _5 Mount Vernon\n  Hampstead\n  Jan. 25, '80._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nWelcome was your postcard announcing recovered health & return to Camden!\nMay this find you safe there, well & hearty, able to go freely to & fro on\nthe ferries & streets. I wish one of those old red Market Ferry cars were\ngoing to land you at our door once more! What you would have to tell us of\nwestern scenes & life! What teas & what evenings we would have--you would\ncertainly have to say \"there is a point beyond which\"--& would have pretty\nlate trips back of moonlight. Strange episode in my life! so unlike what\nwent before & what comes after--those evenings in Philadelphia--yet so\nnatural, familiar, dear! If I were American-born, I certainly should not\nwant to change it for any country in the world, and if as you have\ndreamed--as I too have dreamed--it is given us hereafter to have another\nspell of life on this old earth, may my lot be cast there when the great\ntime dimly preparing is actually come. But meanwhile, dear Friend, my work\nlies here: innumerable are the ties that bind us. And I can only hope &\ndream that you will come & stay with us awhile when we have a home of our\nown. That dear little grandson stayed with me two months till I really\ndidn't know how to part with him, & grew more & more engaging & pretty in\nhis ways every day--rapid indeed is the opening of the little bud at that\nage--between 1 & 3--& the way he had of looking up & giving you little\nkisses of his own accord would win anybody's heart. Bee's letters continue\nas cheery as ever--she is heartily enjoying work & life, and accomplishing\nthe purpose she has set her heart upon, & the people she is with are so\ngood and kindly, it is quite a home. She is working a good deal with the\nmicroscope. Her outdoor recreation is skating. Herby is getting on very\nnicely. He has had a commission to make some designs for a new kind of\npainted tapestry--and his figures \"Audrey & Touchstone\" are very much\nadmired & have been bought by a rich American, & he has a commission for\nmore. But the summer work he has set his heart upon is a portrait of you\nfrom all the material he brought with him--the many attempts he made\nthere--handled with his present improved skill with the brush. I hope you\nwill be able by & bye to send him the photograph he asked for--but no\nhurry. Edward Carpenter came up from Sheffield and spent an evening with\nus--which we all heartily enjoyed--he is a dear fellow. We talked much of\nyou. He has been giving lectures this winter on the Lives of the Great\nDiscoverers in Science. Carpenter knows intimately, goes freely among, a\ngreater range & variety of men than any Englishman I know--he has a way of\nmaking himself thoroughly welcome by the firesides of mechanics & factory\nworkers--his own kith & kin are aristocratic.\n\nGiddy is taking singing lessons again, & hoping by the time you next see\nher to be able to contribute her share of the evening's pleasure. Percy is\nstill working away indomitably at the \"process,\" which is gaining ground\nrapidly on the continent, & I hope I may say slowly & surely in England. I\nsee the Gilders now & then--indeed they are coming up to lunch with us\nto-morrow--Mr. Gilder[34] is the better for rest--& they seem to enjoy\nEngland; but England has done her very worst in the way of climate ever\nsince they have been here. O I do long for a little American sunshine. We\nmet Henry James at the Conways last Sunday & found him one of the\npleasantest of talkers. Rossetti & all your friends are well. Please give\nmy love to your brothers & sister. Were Jessie & Hattie at home in St.\nLouis, I wonder, when you were there? Love from us all.\n\nGood-bye, Dearest Friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nPlease give my love to John Burroughs when you write or see him.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Marley, Haslemere\n  England\n  Aug. 22, '80._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI have had all the welcome papers with accounts of your doings, and to-day\na nice long letter from Mrs. Whitman, which I much enjoyed, giving me\nbetter account of your health again, & of your great enjoyment of the\nwater travel through Canada. So I hope, spite of drawbacks, you will\nreturn to Camden for the winter quite set up in body, as well as full of\ndelightful memories. If only we were at 22nd St. to welcome you back &\ntalk it all over at tea! Ah, those evenings! My friends told me I looked\nten years younger when I came back from America than when I went. And I am\nnot yet quite re-acclimatized; & what with missing the sunshine & working\na little too hard, was feeling quite knocked up: so Bee insisted on my\ncoming down, or rather up, here to stay with some very kind & dear\nfriends. The house stands all alone on a great heath-covered hill, and\nbelow & around are endless coppices, so that you step from the lawn into\n[a] winding wood-path, along which I wander by the hour: and from my\nwindow I look over much such a view as we had at Round Hill Hotel,\nNorthampton, this time two years, only that with the soft haze that is so\noften spread over our landscape, the distant hill looks more ghostly in\nthe moonlight. My friend is a noble, large-hearted, capable woman, who\ndevotes all her life and energies to keeping alive an invalid husband; and\nhe well deserves her care, for he has a beautiful nature, too, & their\nmutual affection is unbounded. He is just ordered by the doctors to leave\nthe home they have made for themselves up here--which is as lovely as it\ncan be--& to spend two years at least in Italy. So it is a sorrowful time\nwith them--they have no children, but have adopted a little niece. Our new\nhouse is just ready & we are daily expecting our furniture from America.\nHerby has been working as usual, making good progress & has just done a\nbeautiful little drawing for the new edition of his father's book. Bee,\nyou will be glad to hear, has decided to continue her medical studies & is\ngoing to be assistant to a lady doctor at Edinburgh, who is to pay her\nsufficient salary to cover all remaining expenses. Meanwhile we have got\nher at home for a few weeks to help us through with the move in, and a sad\npinch it will be to part with her again. Giddy has been paying a\ndelightful visit to some friends of Carpenter's near Leeds--a Quaker\nfamily--the daughter very lovable & admirable. We do not forget the\nStaffords[35] nor they us. Mont. often sends Herby a magazine or a token.\nLove to them when you see them, & to Mr. & Mrs. Whitman & Hattie & Jessie\n& kindest remembrance to Dr. Bucke. Send me a line soon, dear Friend--I\nthink of you continually & know that somewhere & somehow we are to meet\nagain, & that there is a tie of love between us that time & change & death\nitself cannot touch.\n\nWith love,\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LVI\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner, England\n  12 Well Road, Hampstead, London\n  November 30th, 1880._\n\nMY DEAR WALT:\n\nYour postcard came to hand some little time ago. I was pleased to get it,\nto hear of your being well, & with your friends. I have been extremely\nbusy seeing after the new edition of my father's book;[36] the work of\nseeing such a richly illustrated \"edition de luxe\" through the press was\nenormous, but it is done! The binders are now doing their work, & next\nTuesday the reviewers will be doing theirs--I defy them to find any fault\nwith the book. I dare say you think it \"tall\" talk, but I think that it is\nthe most perfectly gotten up book that I ever have seen. My mother has\nwritten an admirable memoir of my father at the end of the second vol.\n\n         POND MUSINGS\n  (Pen sketch of a butterfly)\n             by\n         WALT WHITMAN\n\nI thought that this was to be the title of your prose volume. I will\nundertake the illustrations, choosing the paper (hand made), everything\nexcept the expense of reproducing, etc. I should say London is the place\nto have things executed in: if you wish to give photos they must be drawn\nby an artist and reproduced; no photo ever looked well in a book yet! they\nhaven't decorative importance and don't blend with type. I should suggest\nthat we should imitate the artistic size & style of your earliest edition\nof \"Leaves of G.,\" a large, thin, flat volume, a fanciful, but as\ninexpensive as possible, cover written in gold on blue, a waterlily say:\nbut I could think this over. I will design fanciful tailpieces to be woven\nin with the text; as a frontispiece the drawing that I gave you, retouched\nby me, and reproduced by the Typographic Etching Company, 23 Farringdon\nstreet, London, E. C. All these are only suggestions, which I am prepared\nto execute in right earnest thought. I read your letter to mother with\ninterest. We like our new house so much, & I am sure that you would. You\nmust come and stay with us & stroll on Hampstead Heath, & ride down into\nLondon upon an omnibus & sit to some good sculptor here in London (Boem\nsay). And you yourself could make arrangements with the publishers. With\nremembrance to friends,\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LVII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Well Rd., Hampstead\n  Apr. 18, '81._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI have just been sauntering in our little but sunny garden which slopes to\nthe South--surveying with much satisfaction some fruit trees--plum, green\ngage, pear, cherry, apple--which we have just had planted to train up\nagainst the house and fence--in which fashion fruit ripens much better\nwith our English modicum of sunshine, besides taking no room & casting no\nshade over your little bit of ground--Then we have filled our large window\nwith flowers in pots which make the room smell as delicious as a garden.\nGiddy is assiduous in keeping them well watered & tended.--Welcome was\nyour postcard--with the little rain-bird's coy note in it. But I had not\nbefore heard of your illness, dear friend--the letter before, you spoke of\nbeing unusually well, as I trust you are again now, & enjoying the spring.\nI am well again so far as digestion &c. goes; but bronchitis asthma of a\nchronic kind still trouble me. My breath is so short I cannot walk, which\nis a privation. I am going, at the beginning of June, to stay with Bee in\nEdinburgh, as she will not have any holiday or be able to come & see us\nthis year, & much am I longing to be with her. Have you begun to have any\nsummer thoughts, dear Walt? And do they turn towards England, & our nest\ntherein? Yes, I have received & have enjoyed all the papers &\ncuttings--dearly like what you said of Carlyle. Everyone here is speaking\nbitterly of the harsh judgments & sarcastic descriptions of people in the\n\"reminiscenses.\" But I know that at bottom his heart was genial and good &\nthat he wrote those in a miserable mood--& never looked at them again\nafterwards. I hope you received the little memoir of my husband all right.\nHerby is very busy with a drawing of you--hopes that with the many\nsketches he made, & the vivid impress on his memory & the help of\nphotographs, it will be good. I wish he had possessed as much power with\nthe brush when he was in America as he has now--he is making very great\nprogress in mastery of the technique. I observe, too, that he reads &\ndwells upon your poems--especially the \"Walt Whitman\"--with growing\nfrequency & delight. We often say, \"Won't Walt like sitting in that sunny\nwindow?\" or \"by that cheery open fire\" or \"sauntering on the heath\"--&\npicture you here in a thousand different ways. I believe Maggie Lesley is\ncoming from Paris, where she is studying art in good earnest, at the\nbeginning of May, & then will come and spend a few days with us. Welcome\nare American friends! The Buxton Forman's took tea with us last week & we\nhad pleasant talk of you & of Dr. Bucke. Mrs. Forman is a sincere,\nsympathetic, motherly woman whom you would like. The Rossetti's too have\nbeen to see us--we didn't think William in the best health or spirits--&\nhis wife was not looking well either, but then another baby is just\ncoming.\n\nThis Easter time the poorest of London working folk flock in enormous\nnumbers to Hampstead Heath; it is a sight that would interest you--they\nare rougher & noisier & poorer than such folks in America--& the men more\nprone to get the worse for drink--but there is a good deal of fun &\nmerriment too--the girls & boys racing about on donkeys (who have a pretty\nhard time of it)--plenty of merry-go-rounds--& enjoyment of the pure air\n& sunshine, & such sights, more than they know. The light is failing,\ndearest friend; so with love from us all, good-bye.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nFriendliest greeting to your brother & sister & to Hattie & Jessie when\nyou write & to the Staffords.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LVIII\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner, Well Road\n  North London\n  Hampstead, England\n  June 5th, 1881, Sunday afternoon_\n  5 P. M.\n\nMY DEAR WALT:\n\nYou don't write me a letter nor take any notice of my magnificent offers\nconcerning \"Pond Musings\", etc. however, I will forgive you this\noft-repeated offence. I often think of you, very often of America and\nthings generally there, and nearly always with pleasure.\n\nMy mother is away staying with Beatrice in Edinburgh city, recruiting her\nhealth, which has most sadly needed it of late. So I and Grace & a new\nScotch lassie, one Margaret, who officiates as servant most efficaciously\ntoo, I can tell you (such scrubbing & cleaning as you never saw the like)\nwe three, I say, are alone at Keats Corner; cool sitting here in our long\ndrawing-room (hung with innumerable pictures as of yore), although it has\nbeen scorchingly hot this past month. The morning I spend sketching on\nHampstead Heath, which is lovely just now, all the May-trees are in full\nbloom the gorse & broom are a blaze of yellow, the rooks fly constantly by\na quarter of a mile (seemingly) overhead, the sly fellows giving some side\nlike dart when you look up at them even at that height. I am painting one\nof them; so I have to look up pretty often. In the early morning the\nnightingale sings, oh, so sweetly, long trills & roulades in the most\naccomplished manner.\n\nLast Wednesday Miss Ellen Terry, whose name you are doubtless familiar\nwith as being the leading actress in London, well, she called upon me to\nask my advice or opinion of a drawing connected with my father's book.\nEllen Terry expressed herself highly interested in our house, pictures,\ndecorations and so forth. Her manner was a little stagey, but graceful to\nthe extreme, and you could see peeping out of this theatric manner a kind,\ngood heart, oh, so kind, I feel as if I would do anything for her, her\nmanners were so winning. \"Will you come to the stage entrance of the\nLyceum some day soon and you shall have stalls for two; now will you come?\nDo.\" Were her last words to Grace. I called on her at Kensington last\nweek, returning the drawing, and I was so charmed with two beautiful\nchildren of hers, a tall, fair girl, a pretty mixture of shyness and\nself-possession that quite won me. She too I should fancy will be a great\nactress some day, she has such a bright face. The boy, Master Ted, was\nnice too.\n\nWell, I gave Ellen Terry a proof of a drawing that I have just completed\nfor Dr. Bucke's book--a job I got through Buxton Forman, a great friend of\nBucke's, done _con amore_ on my part. This drawing has been beautifully\nreproduced by the new photo intaglio-process. I hope Dr. Bucke will like\nit, but I should not expect great things from him in that line, judging\nfrom the twopenny hapenny little pen & ink sketch by Waters which he sent\nover in the first instance; however, Forman rescued him from that & so far\nhe has been guided by his friend. Whether he will when he sees my drawing,\nwe neither of us know; but both feel to have done our best in the matter.\nI said that Ellen Terry must ask for you when she goes to America, which\nshe contemplates some day. I have sold the last drawing I made in New\nYork of you for L10. 10s to Buxton Forman ($50. odd). Church bells have\njust commenced chiming in the distance, a sound I like better than the\nparsons. I hear that the young American artists are doing capitally\nfilling their pockets. My cousin Sidney Thomas is, or was, in America, a\ngood deal lionized, I understand. If at any time you favour me with a\nletter let it be a letter and not a postcard please. I have been reading\nCarlyle's reminiscences--good stuff in them, brilliant touches, but\ndreadfully morbid, don't you think? & one shuts the book up with a feeling\nthat in some respect one Carlyle is enough in the world: & yet in some\nrespects a million wouldn't be too many. I often think of your remark to\nus one day that tolerance is the rarest quality in the world.\n\nInterested in those Boston scraps you send my mother. You have always been\npretty well received in Boston, have you not--I mean in the Emerson days?\nPity that when Emerson is no more there will be no fine portrait of him in\nexistence; there was a nobility stamped upon his face that I never saw the\nlike of, and which should have been caught and stamped forever on canvas.\n\nWe all see something of the Formans & all like them; they have so much\ncharacter, rather unusual in literary folk of the lighter sort, I fancy;\nbut there is something very fresh and original about Forman. Nice children\nthey have, too. Miss Blind is bringing out a volume of poems; why will\npeople all imagine they can write poetry? William Rossetti is writing a\nhundred sonnets--writes one a day; one about John Brown is not bad: and\nmany are instructive, but are in no sense poems. I am going down to tea &\nmust not keep Grace waiting any longer. Love to you.\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LIX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _12 Well Road, Hampstead\n  London, Dec. 14, '81._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYour welcome letter to hand. I have longed for a word from you--could not\nwrite myself[37]--was stricken dumb--nay, there is nothing but silence for\nme still. Herby wrote to Mrs. Stafford first, thinking that so the shock\nwould come less abruptly to you.\n\nI heard of you at Concord in a kind long letter from Frederick Holland,\nwith whose wife you had some conversation. Indeed all that sympathy and\nwarm & true words of love & sorrow & highest admiration & esteem for my\ndarling could do to comfort me I have had--and most & best from America.\nAnd many of her poor patients at Edinburgh went sobbing from the door when\nthey heard they should see her no more.\n\nThe report of your health is comforting dear friend. Mine too is better--I\nam able to take walks again--though still liable to sudden attacks of\ndifficult breathing.\n\nHerby is working hard--has just been disappointed over a competition\ndesign which he sent in to the Royal Academy--a very poor & specious work\nobtaining the premium--but is no whit discouraged & has no need to be, for\nhe is making great progress--works hard, loves his work & is of the stuff\nwhere of great painters are made, I am persuaded--so he can afford to\nwait. Giddy is not quite so well & strong as I could wish, but there\nseems nothing serious. She is working diligently at the development of her\nvoice--& is learning German. Dr. Bucke's friend, Mr. Buxton Forman, & his\nwife are very warm, staunch friends of Herby's.\n\nPlease give my love to your sister, and tell her that her good letter\nspoke the right words to me & that I shall write before very long. Thanks\nfor the paper, dear friend--& for those that came when I was too\noverwhelmed but which I have since read with deep interest--those about\nyour visit to your birthplace. With love from us all--good-bye, dearest\nFriend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _12 Well Road\n  Jan 29, '82._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYour letter to Herby was a real talk with you. I don't know why I punish\nmyself by writing to you so seldom now, for indeed to be near you, even in\nthat way would do me good--often & often do I wish we were back in America\nnear you. As I write this I am sitting to Herby for my portrait again--he\nhas never satisfied himself yet: but this one seems coming on nicely--and\nso is the Consuelo picture. Another one he has in his mind is to be called\n\"The tea-party,\" and it is to be the old group round our table in\nPhiladelphia--you & me and dear Bee & Giddy & himself. He thinks that what\nwith memory & photograph & the studies he made when with you, he will be\nable to put you & my darling on the canvas.\n\nGiddy's voice is developing into a really fine contralto & she has the\nwork in her to become an artist, I think & will turn out one of the\ntortoises who outstrip the hares. Percy and Norah are spending the winter\nin London (at Kensington)--and we can get round by train in half an hour;\nso I often see them and the dear little man. Do you remember the Miss\nChases--two pleasant maiden ladies who took tea with us once in\nPhiladelphia & talked about Sojourner Truth? One of the sisters is in\nLondon this winter & has been several times to see us. The birds are\nbeginning to sing very sweetly here--& our room is full of the perfume of\nspring flowers--indoor ones. Did dear Bee tell you, in the long letter she\nonce wrote you, how much she loved the Swiss ladies with whom she made her\nhome while in Berne? A more tender & beautiful love and sorrow than that\nwith which they cherish the memory of her never grew in any heart. I think\nyou will like to see some of their letters--please return them, for they\nare very precious to me (the little matters they thank me for are some of\ndear Bee's things which I sent them for tokens). Love to your sister &\nbrother. How are Mr. Marvin & Mr. Burroughs? Best love from us all.\nGood-bye, dear Friend.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _12 Well Road\n  Hampstead\n  May 8th, '82._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nHerby went to David Bognes[38] about a week ago: he himself was out, but\nH. saw the head man, who reported that the sale of \"Leaves of Grass\" was\nprogressing satisfactorily. I hope you have received, or will receive,\ntangible proof of the same. Bognes is a young publisher, but, I believe\nfrom what I hear, a man to be relied on. His father was the publisher of\nmy husband's first literary venture & behaved honourably. Herby brought\naway for me a copy of the new edition. I like the type like that of '73, &\nthe pale green leaf it is folded in so to speak. I find a few new friends\nto love--perhaps I have not yet found them all out. But you must not\nexpect me to take kindly to any changes in the titles or arrangement of\nthe old beloved friends. I love them too dearly--every word & _look_ of\nthem--for that. For instance, I want \"Walt Whitman\" instead of \"Myself\" at\nthe top of the page. Also my own longing is always for a chronological\narrangement, if change at all there is to be; for that at once makes\nbiography of the best kind. What deaths, dear Friend! As for me, my heart\nis already gone over to the other side of the river, so that sometimes I\nfeel a kind of rejoicing in the swelling of the ranks of the great company\nthere. Darwin, with his splendid day's work here gently closed; Rossetti,\nwhose brilliant genius had got entangled in a premature physical decay, so\nthat _his_ day's work was over too! In a letter to me, William, who was\nthe best, most faithful & loving of brothers to him, says, \"I doubt\nwhether he would ever have regained that energy of body & concentration of\nmental resource which could have enabled him to resume work at his full &\nwonted power. Without these faculties at ready command my dear Gabriel\nwould not have been himself.\" Edward Carpenter's father, too, is gone, but\nhe at a ripe age without disease--sank gently.\n\nThe photographs I enclose are but poor suggestions--please give one to\nMrs. Whitman with my love, or if you prefer to keep both, I will send her\nothers. Does the idea ever come into your head, dear Friend, of spending a\nlittle time this summer or autumn in your English home at Hampstead?\n\nHerby is well and working happily. So is Grace. Little grandson & his\nparents away in Worcestershire.\n\nIt is indescribably lovely spring weather here just now. A carpenter near\nus has a sky-lark in a cage which sings as jubilantly as if it were\nmounting into the sky, & is so tame that when he takes it out of the cage\nto wash its little claws, which are apt to get choked up with earth, in\nwarm water, it breaks out singing in his hand! Love from us all, dearest\nFriend. Good-bye.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nAffectionate greetings to your brother & sister & Hattie & Jessie.\n\nDo you ever see Mr. Marvin? If so, give our love, we hope to see him one\nday.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Well Rd., Hampstead, London\n  Nov. 24, '82._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYou have long ere this, I hope, received Herby's letter telling of the\nsafe arrival of the precious copy of \"Specimen Days,\" with the portraits:\nit makes me very proud. Your father had a fine face too--there is\nsomething in it that takes hold of me & that seems to be a kind of natural\nbackground or substratum to the radiant sweetness of that other sacred &\nbeloved face completing your parentage. I like heartily too the new\nportraits of you: they are all wanted as different aspects: but the two\nthat remain my favourites are the portrait taken about 30 without coat of\nany kind, and the one you sent me in '69 next to those I love these two\nlatest--& in some respects better, because they are the Walt I saw & had\nsuch happy hours with. The second copy of book & my lending one, has come\nsafe--too--and the card that told of your attack of illness, & the welcome\nnews of your recovery in the Paper; & I have been fretting with impatience\nat my own dumbness--but tied to as many hours a day writing as I could\npossibly manage, at my little book now (last night)--finished, all but\nproofs, so that I can take my pleasure in \"Specimen Days\" at last; but\nbefore doing that must have a few words with you, dearest Friend. First a\ngossip. Do you remember Maggie Lesley? She came to see us on her way to\nParis, where she is working all alone & very earnestly to get through\ntraining as an artist--then going to start in a studio of her own in\nPhiladelphia. She, like my mother's sister, are to me fine, lovable\nsamples of American women--in whom, I mean, I detect, like the distinctive\naroma of a flower, something special--that is American--a decisive new\nquality to old-world perceptions. Herby is working away still chiefly at\nthe Consuelo picture--has got a very beautiful model to-day sitting to\nhim. His summer work was down in Warwickshire, making sketches--& very\ncharming ones they are, of George Eliot's native scenes--one of a\ngarden-nook--up steep, old, worn stone steps bordered with flowers that is\nenticing--it will make a lovely background for a figure picture.--Giddy's\nvoice is growing in richness & strength--& she works with all her heart,\nhoping one day to be a real artist vocally--in church & oratorio music.\nShe will not have power or dramatic ability for opera--nor can I wish that\nshe had; there are so many thorns with the roses in that path. I fear you\nwill be a loser by Bogne's bankruptcy. Did I tell you that among our\nfriends one of your warmest admirers is Henry Holmes, the great violinist\n(equal [to] Joachim some think--we among them). Per. & wife & little\ngrandson all well. My love to brother & sister & to Hattie [&] Jessie.\nGood-bye, dear Walt. I hope to write more & better soon.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nGreetings to the Staffords.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _12 Well Rd.\n  Hampstead\n  Jan. 27, '83._\n\nIt is not for want of thinking of you, dear Walt, that I write but seldom:\nfor indeed my thoughts are chiefly occupied with you & your other\nself--your Poems--& with struggles to say a few words that I think want\nsaying about them; that might help some to their birthright who now stand\noff, either ignorant or misapprehending.\n\nWe all go on much as usual.\n\n_Feb. 13._ I wonder if you will like a true story of Lady Dilke that I\nheard the other day--I do: It was before her marriage. She was a handsome\nyoung heiress, a daring horsewoman, fond of hunting. There was a man,\nweakly & of good position, who had behaved very basely & cruelly to a\nyoung girl in her neighbourhood, & when (as is the case in England) half\nthe county was assembled on the hunting field, Lady D. faced him & said in\na voice that could be heard afar, \"Sir you are a black-guard, & if these\ngentlemen had the right spirit in them they would horsewhip you.\" He\nlooked at her with effrontery & made a mocking bow. \"But,\" she continued,\n\"since they won't, I will\"--and she cut him across the face with her\nriding whip; upon which he turned and rode off the field, like a dog with\nhis tail between his legs, & reappeared in that neighbourhood no more. She\nwas a woman much beloved--died at the birth of her first child (from too\nmuch chloroform having been given her). Her husband was heart-broken. I\nsee you, too, are having floods. With us it pours five days out of seven,\n& so in Germany & France. We have made the acquaintance of Arabella\nBuckley, who has just written an interesting article about Darwin, whom\nshe knew well, for the _Century_. She says his was the most entirely\nbeautiful & perfect nature she ever came in contact with. How I wish we\ncould have a glimpse of each other, dear Friend--half an hour talk--nay, a\ngood long look & a hand-shake. Herby is overhead painting in his\nstudio--such a pleasant room. How is John Burroughs? We owe him a letter &\nthanks for a good art. on Carlyle. Love to you, dearest friend.\n\nHearty remembrances to your brother & sister & Hattie & Jessie.\n\nA. G.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXIV\n\nHERBERT H. GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Well Road, Hampstead, London, England\n  April 29th, '83._\n\nMY DEAR WALT:\n\nYour card to hand last night, with its sad account of dear Mrs. Stafford's\nhealth; but what the doctor says is cheering. I wonder, though, what the\ndoctor would call good weather--mild spring, I suppose.\n\nVery glad, my dear old Walt, to see your strong familiar handwriting\nagain; it does one good, it's so individual that it is next to seeing you.\nRight glad to hear of your good health--had an idea that you were not so\nwell again this winter. John Burroughs was very violent against my\nintaglio; on the other hand, Alma Tadema--our great painter here--liked it\nvery much. I take violent criticism pretty philosophically, now that I see\nhow unreliable it nearly always is. John Burroughs has got a fixed idea\nabout your personality, and that is that the top of your head is a foot\nhigh and any portrait that doesn't develop the \"dome\" is no\nportrait.--Curious what eyes a man may have for everything except a\npicture. I finished lately a life-size portrait of James Simmons, J.P., a\nhunting (fox) squire of the old school--such a fine old fellow. My\nportrait represents him standing firmly, in a scarlet hunting-coat well\nstained with many a wet chase, his great whip tucked under his arm whilst\nbuttoning on his left glove, white buckskin trousers in shade relieving\nthe scarlet coat, black velvet hunting cap, dark rich blue background to\nqualify and cool the scarlet. I wish you could see it. Then I have painted\na subject \"The Good Gray Poet's Gift.\" I have long meant to build up\nsomething of you from my studies, adding colour. You play a prominent part\nin this picture--seated at table bending over a nosegay of flowers,\npoetizing, before presenting them to mother. I am standing up bending over\nthe tea-pot, with the kettle, filling it up; opposite you sits Giddy; out\nof the window a pretty view of Cannon place, Hampstead. Mater thinks it a\npretty picture and a good likeness of you, just as you used to sit at tea\nwith us at 1729 N. 22nd St. Now I am going out for a stroll on Hampstead\nHeath. Have just come in from a long ramble over the Heaths--a lovely soft\nspring day, innumerable birds in full song. I think J. B. is right when he\nsays that your birds are more plaintive than ours--it's nature's way of\ncompensating us for a loss of sunshine: what would England be without the\nmerry lark, the very embodiment of cheeriness. Are not the Carlyle &\nEmerson letters interesting? It seems to me to be one of the most\nbeautiful and pathetic things in literature, C's fondness for E. But all\nEnglishmen, I must tell you, are not grumblers like Carlyle; he stands\nquite alone in that quality--look at Darwin!\n\nI should be grateful for another postcard. With all love,\n\nHERB. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead\n  May 6, '83._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI feel as if this beautiful spring morning here in England must send you\ngreetings through me. Our sunny little mound of garden, which runs down\ntoward the south, is fragrant with hyacinths and wall-flowers (beautiful,\ntawny, reddish, yellow fellows laden with rich perfume)--and at the bottom\nis a big old cherry tree--one mass of snowy blossom; in a neighbour's gay\ngarden & beyond is a distant glimpse of some tall elms just putting on\ntheir first tender green: our little breakfast room where I always sit of\na morning opens with glass doors into this garden. Herby is gone with the\n\"Sunday Tramps,\" of whom he is a member, for a ten or fifteen-mile walk.\nSaid tramps are some half dozen friends & neighbours, some of them very\nlearned professors but genial good fellows withal, who agree to spend\nevery other Sunday morning in taking one of their long walks together--& a\nvery good time they have. Giddy is gone to hear a lecture; our bonnie\nScotch girl is roasting the beef for dinner, singing the while in the\nkitchen; and pussy & I are sitting very companionable & meditative in the\nlittle room before described.\n\nYou cannot think, dear friend, what a pleasure it was to have a whole big\nletter from you (not that I despise Postcards--they are good stop-gaps,\nbut not the real thing). Yes, I have & prize the article on the Hebrew\nScriptures. How I wish you could make up your mind to spend your summer\nholiday with us.\n\nI am still struggling along, striving to say something which, if I can say\nit to my mind, will be useful--will clear away a little of the rubbish\nthat hides you from men's eyes. I hear the \"Eminent Women Series\" is\nhaving quite a large sale in America. Good-bye. Love to Mrs. Whitman.\nGreetings to your brother. Love from us all to you.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXVI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead, Jul. 30, 1883._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nLazy me, that have been thinking letters to you instead of writing them!\nWe have Dr. Bucke's book at last; could not succeed in buying one at\nTuerbner's--I believe they all sold directly--but he has sent us one. There\nare some things in it I prize very highly--namely, Helen Price's\n\"Memoranda\" and Thomas A. Gere's. These I like far better than any\npersonal reminiscences of you I have ever read & I feel much drawn to the\nwriters of them. Also your letter to Mrs. Price from the Hospitals, dear\nFriend. That makes one hand-in-hand with you--then & there--& gives one a\nglimpse of a very beautiful friendship. But why & why did Dr. Bucke set\nhimself to counteract that beneficient law of nature's by which the dust\ntends to lay itself? And carefully gathering together again all the\nrubbish stupid or malevolent that has been written of you, toss it up in\nthe air again to choke and blind or disgust as many as it may? What a\ncurious piece of perversity to mistake this for candour & a judicial\nspirit.[39] Then again, how do I hate all that unmeaning, irrelevant\nclatter about what Rabelais or Shakespeare or the ancients & their times\ntolerated in the way of coarseness or plainness of speech. As if you\nwanted apologizing for or could be apologized for on that ground! If these\npoems are to be _tolerated_, I, for one, could not tolerate them. If they\nare not the highest lesson that has yet been taught in refinement &\npurity, if they do not banish all possibility of coarseness of thought &\nfeeling, there would be nothing to be said for them. But they do: I am as\nsure of that as of my own existence. When will men begin to understand\nthem?\n\nWe have had pleasant glimpses of several American friends this summer--of\nKate Hillard for instance, who, by the bye narrowly escaped a bad accident\njust at our door--the harness broke & the cab came down on the horse &\nfrightened him so that he bolted--struck the cab against a lamp-post\n(happily, else it would have been worse)--overturned them & it--but when\nthey crawled out no worse harm was done than a few cuts from the glass--&\nKate & her friend behaved very pluckily, & we had a pleasant evening\ntogether after all. Then there was Arthur Peterson, looking much as in the\nold Philadelphia days: and Emma & Annie Lazarus--who, owing to some\nletters of introduction from James the novelist, have had a very gay time\nindeed--been quite lionized--and last, not least, Mr. Dalton Dorr, the\ncurator of the Pennsylvania Museum in Fairmount Park--whom we all liked\nmuch. He is enjoying his visit here with all his heart--is a great\nenthusiast for our old Gothic Cathedrals, and for everything\nbeautiful--but says there is nothing such a source of unceasing wonder &\ndelight as riding about London & over the bridges &c on the top of an\nomnibus watching the endless flow of people--it is indeed a kind of human\nMississippi or Niagara.\n\nThe young folks are busy packing up to start for the seaside. Herby wants\na background for a picture in which green turf & trees and all the\nrichness of vegetation come down to the very edge of the sea and I seem to\nremember such a place near Lynn Regis, where I was thirty years ago, when\nmy eldest child was born, so they are going to look it up. We hear the\nheat is very tremendous in America this year. I hope you are as well as\never able to stand it & enjoy it? I wonder where you are. Friendly\ngreetings to Mr. & Mrs. Whitman & Hattie & Jessie & the Staffords. Love to\nyou, dear Friend, from us all.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\nMy little book on Mary Lamb just out--will send you a copy in a day or\ntwo.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXVII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead\n  Oct. 13, '83._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nLong & long does it seem since I have had any word or sign from you. I\nhope all goes well & that you have had a pleasant, refreshing summer trip\nsomewhere. All goes on much as usual with us.\n\n_Hythe. Kent. Oct. 21._ Not having felt very well the last month or two,\nand Giddy also seeming to need a little bracing up, we came down to this\nancient town by the sea--one of the Cinque Ports--on Wednesday, and much\nwe like it--a fine open sea--a delicious \"briny odour\"--and inland much\nthat is curious and interesting--for this part of the Kentish Coast--so\nnear to France--has innumerable old castles, forts, moats, traces\neverywhere of centuries of warfare and of means of defence against our\ngreat neighbour. It is a fine hilly, woody country, too, and very\npicturesque these gray massive ruins, many of them used now as farm\nhouses, look. The men of Kent are very proud of their country and are\nreckoned a fine race--tall, muscular, ruddy-complexioned, and often too\nwith thick, tawny-red beards--curious how in our little island the\ndifferences of race-stock are still so discernible--keep along this same\ncoast to the west only about a couple of hundred miles & you come to such\na different type--dark--blackest and Cornish men.--I get a nice letter\nnow & then from John Burroughs. I also saw this summer two women doctors\nwho were very kind & good friends to my darling Bee--Drs. Pope--twin\nsisters from Boston, whom it did me good to see. They work hard--have a\ngood practice--& say they don't know what a day's illness means so far as\nthey themselves are concerned. They tell me also that the women doctors\nare doing capital work in America--and that one of them, who was with dear\nBeatrice at the Penn. Med. Col., Dr. Alice Bennett, is the efficient head\nof the woman's department of a large lunatic asylum. We are getting on in\nEngland too--but the field where English women doctors find the most work\n& the best position is India, where as the women are not allowed by their\nmale relatives to be attended by men, the mortality was immense.--Herby\nhas taken a better studio than our house afforded--both as to light &\nsize--& finds the advantage great. I expect he is having a delightful walk\nthis brilliant morning with the \"Hampstead Tramps\"--of whom I think I have\ntold you. They often walk fifteen miles or so on Sunday morning.\n\nSuch a glorious afternoon it has been by the sea--sapphire colour--the air\nbrisk & elastic, yet soft. To-morrow Gran goes home & I shall be all alone\nhere.--I hear of \"Specimen Days\" in a letter from Australia--there will be\na large audience for you there some day, dear Friend. I like what John\nBurroughs has been writing about Carlyle much. We have had nothing but\nstupidities of late about him here--but there will come a great reaction\nfrom all this abuse, I have no doubt--he did put so much gall in his ink\nsometimes, human nature can't be expected to take it altogether meekly. I\nhope you received my little book safely. I should be a hypocrite if I\npretended not to care whether you found patience to read it--for I grew to\nlove Mary & Charles Lamb so much during my task that I want you to love\nthem too--& to see what a beautiful friendship was theirs with Coleridge.\n\nHow are Mr. & Mrs. Whitman and Hattie & Jessie? Send me a few words soon.\n\nGood-bye, dearest Friend.\n\nANN GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXVIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead\n  April 5, '84._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThose few words of yours to Herby \"tasted good\" to us--few, but enough,\nseeing that we can fill out between the lines with what you have given us\nof yourself forever & always in your books--& that is how I comfort myself\nfor having so few letters. But I turn many wistful thoughts toward\nAmerica, and were not I & mine bound here by unseverable ties, did we not\nseem to grow & belong here as by a kind of natural destiny that has to be\nfulfilled very cheerfully, could I make America my home for the sake of\nbeing near you in body as I am in heart & soul--but Time has good things\nin store for us sooner or later, I doubt not. I could hardly express to\nyou how welcome is the thought of death to me--not in the sense of any\ndiscontent with life--but as life with fresh energies & wider horizon &\nhand in hand again with those that are gone on first.\n\nHerby found the little bit of gray cloth very useful--but one day _save\nhim an old suit_. Your figure in the picture is, I think, a fair\nsuggestion of one aspect of you; but not, could not of course be, an\nadequate portrait. He will never rest till he has done his best to achieve\nthat. As soon as he can afford it (for it is a very slow business indeed\nfor a young artist to make money in England, though when he does begin he\nis better paid than in America) he means to run over to see you. He says\nhe should like always to spend his winters in New York. I say how very\nhighly I prize that last slip you sent me, \"A backward glance on my own\nroad\"? It both corroborates & explains much that I feel very deeply.--If\nyou are seeing Mrs. Whitman, please say her letter was a pleasure & that I\nshall write again before very long. I feel as if this letter would never\nfind you--be sure & let us know your whereabouts.\n\nRemembrance & love.\n\nGood-bye, dear Walt.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXIX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Hampstead\n  May 2, '84._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nYour card (your very voice & touch, drawing me across the Atlantic close\nbeside you) was put into my hand just as I was busy copying out \"With\nhusky, haughty lips O sea\" to pin into my \"Leaves of Grass.\" I hardly\nthink there is anything grander there. I think surely they must see that\nthat is the very Soul of Nature uttering itself sublimely.\n\nWho do you think came to see us on Sunday? Professor Dowden.[40] And I\nknow not when I have set eyes on a more beautiful personality. I think you\nwould be as much attracted towards him as I was. It was he who told me\n(full of enthusiasm) of the Poems in _Harper's_ which I had not seen or\nheard of. We had a very happy two or three hours together, talking of you\n& looking through Blake's drawings. He is a tall man, complexion tanned &\nhealthy, nose finely modelled, dark eyes with plenty of life & meaning in\nthem, hair grayish--I should think he was between forty & fifty--but says\nhis father is still a fine hale old man.\n\nHerby disappointed again this year of getting anything into the R.\nAcademy.\n\nI think I like the idea of the shanty, if you have any one to take good\ncare of you, to cook nicely, keep all neat & clean &c. I wonder if I have\never been in Mickle St. I, still busy, still hammering away to see if I\ncan help those that \"balk\" at \"Leaves of Grass\". Perhaps you will smile at\nme--at any rate it bears good fruit to me--I seem to be in a manner living\nwith you the while.\n\nEverything full of beauty just now here, as no doubt it is with you.\n\nGood-bye, dearest friend--don't forget the letter that is to come soon.\nLove from us all, love & again love from\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXX\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Aug. 5, '84._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nThe notion [that] one is going to write a nice long letter is fatal to\nwriting at all. And so I mean to scribble something, somehow, a little\noftener & make up in quantity for quality! For after all the great thing,\nthe thing one wants, is to _meet_--if not in the flesh--then in the\nspirit. A word will do it. I am getting on--my heart is in my work--&\nthough I have been long about it, it won't be long--but I think & hope it\nwill be strong. Quite a sprinkling of American friends--some new ones this\nspring--among them Mr. & Mrs. Pennell[41] from Philadelphia--whom you\nknow--we like them well--hope to see them again & again. Also Miss Keyse\n(her sister married Emerson's son) from Concord, and the Lesleys--Mary\nLesley has married & gone to the West--St. Paul--has just got a little\nson.\n\nHow does the \"little shanty\" answer, I wonder? Herby has been painting\nsome charming little bits in an old terraced garden here. I do wish you\ncould hear Giddy sing now; I am sure her voice would \"go to the right\nspot,\" as you used to say. Good-bye, dearest friend. Love from all & most\nfrom\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Wolverhampton\n  Oct. 26, '84._\n\nDEAR WALT:\n\nI don't suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it\ngives me. But Villiers Stanford is, I think, the best composer England has\nproduced since the days of Purcell & Blow, and your words will be sent\nhome to hundreds & thousands who had not before seen them. How lovely the\nwords read as themes for great music!\n\nI have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy--it\nstands all alone on the top of a heath-clad hill, with miles of coppice\n(young woods) below it, and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more\nwooded hills jutting out into it--and you see the storms a long way off\ntravelling up from the sea, and you can wander for miles & miles through\nthe woods or over the breezy hill--or, as you sit at your window, feel\nyourself in the very heart of a great, beautiful solitude. Very kind, warm\nfriends, too, they are, who leave you as free as a bird to do what you\nlike. I have had all the papers, dear friend, & have enjoyed them.\n\nNow I am in the heart of the \"Black Country,\" as we call it--black with\nthe smoke of thousands of foundries & works of all kinds--staying with\nPercy & his wife. Percy is having a very arduous time here starting some\nSteel Works--& what with his men being inexperienced & times bad & the\nmachinery not yet perfectly adjusted, he seems harassed night & day--for\nthese things have to be kept going all night too--but I hope he will get\ninto smoother waters soon. The little son is rosy & bright & healthy--goes\nto school now, which, being an only child, he enjoys mightily for the sake\nof the companionship of other boys.\n\nLove from us all, dear friend.\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nGrace & Herby well & busy when I left.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead\n  Dec. 17, '84._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nAt last I have extracted a little bit of news about you from friend\nCarpenter, who never comes to see us and is [as] reluctant to write\nletters as--somebody else that I know. That you have a comfortable,\nelderly couple to keep house for you was a good hearing--for \"the old\nshanty\" had risen before my eyes as somewhat lonely, & perhaps the\ncooking, &c., not well attended to.--There seems a curious kind of ebb and\nflow about the recognition of you in England--just now there are signs of\nthe flow--of a steadily gathering great wave, one indication of which is\nthe little pamphlet just published in Edinburgh--one of the \"Round Table\"\nSeries--no doubt a copy has been sent you. If not and you would care to\nsee it, I will send you one. On the whole I like it (barring one or two\nstupidities)--at any rate, as compared with what has hitherto been\nwritten. My poor article has so far been rejected by editors--so I have\nlaid it by for a little, to come with a fresh eye & see if I can make it\nin any way more likely to win a hearing--though I often say to myself, \"If\nthey have not ears to hear you, how is it likely one can unstop their\nears?\" But on the other hand there is always the chance of leading some\nto read the Poems who had not else done so.--Percy & Norah and Archie, now\ngrown a very sturdy active little fellow, are coming to spend Xmas with\nus, which is a great pleasure.\n\nI am deep in Froude's last volumes of \"Carlyle's Life in London\". Folks\nare grumbling that they have had enough & too much of Carlyle & _his_\ngrumblings and sarcasms. But he is an inexhaustibly interesting figure to\nme, & will remain so in the long run to the world, I am persuaded. It\ngrieves me that he should have been so cruelly unjust to himself as a\nhusband--that remorse, those bitter self-reproaches, were undeserved, were\naltogether morbid: he was not only an infinitely better husband than she\nwas wife: he was wonderfully affectionate & tender & just--& as to his\ntemper & irritable nerves, she knew what she was about when she married\nhim. Herby was walking through the British Museum the other day with a\nfriend when a group, a ready-made picture, struck him--it was a young\nstudent-sculptress, a graceful girl high on a pile of boxes modelling in\nclay a copy of an antique statue, & standing below, looking up at her, was\na young sculptor in his blouse, criticising her work with much animation &\ngesture; the background of the group, a part of the Elgin Marbles. So this\nis what Herby is painting & I think he will make a very jolly little\npicture out of it. I have been much a prisoner to the house with bad colds\never since I returned from Wolverhampton, but am beginning to get out\nagain--which puts new life into me. I have never envied anything in this\nworld but a man's strong legs & powers of tramping, tramping, over hill &\ndale as long as he pleases--legs would content me and a sound breathing\napparatus! I am in no hurry for wings. Giddy's voice, too, is just now\neclipsed by cold.\n\nI hope you have escaped this evil and are able to jaunt to & fro on the\nferries as freely as ever. And I hope the pleasant Quaker friends are\nwell--and Mr. & Mrs. Whitman and Hattie & Jessie--there is a fellow\nstudent of Giddy's at the Guild Hall music school who so reminds her of\nHattie.\n\nLove from us all, dear friend. Most from me.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXIII\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Keats Corner\n  Hampstead, England\n  Feb. 27, '85._\n\nDEAREST FRIEND:\n\nHow has the winter passed with you I wonder? Me it has imprisoned very\nmuch with bronchial & asthmatic troubles--and the four walls of the house\n& the ceiling seem to close in upon one's spirit as well as one's body,\nall too much. I hope you have been able to wend to and fro daily on the\ngreat ferry boats & enjoy the beautiful broad river & the sky & the\nthrongs of people as of old--you are in my thoughts as constantly as ever,\nthough I have been so silent. Percy & his wife & the little son spent some\nweeks with us at Christmas & now they have taken a house quite near, into\nwhich they will be moving in a week or two. I can't tell you what a dear,\naffectionate, reasonable, companionable little fellow Archie is--now six\nyears old. Perhaps you will have seen in the American papers that Sidney\nThomas, the cousin with whom Percy was associated in the discovery of the\nBasic process, is dead--he spent his strength too freely--wore himself out\nat 35--he was much loved by all with whom he had to do. His mother &\nsister have been watching & hoping against hope & taking him to warm\nclimates, he himself full of hope--the mind bright and active to the\nlast--& now he is gone--& his eldest brother died only two months before\nhim.--I cannot help grieving over public affairs too--never in my lifetime\nhas old England been in such a bad way--no honest & capable man seemingly\nto take the helm--& what Carlyle was fond of describing as the attempt to\nguide the ship by the shouts of the bystanders on shore--the newspapers\n&c. prospering very ill. A government that tries perpetually how to do it\nand how not to do it at the same moment! The best comfort is that I do not\nthink there is any, the smallest sign, of deterioration in the English\nrace; so we shall pull through somehow, after tremendous disasters. How\nmany things should I like to sit and chat with you about, dear Walt--above\nall to see you again! I could not get my article into any of the magazines\nI most wished. I believe it is coming out in _To-Day_. Giddy was so\npleased at your sending her a paper--a very capital article too it is of\nMiss Kellogg. I was interested also in a little paragraph I found about\nPullman town, near Chicago, which confirmed my suspicion that it was not a\nthing with healthy roots--but only a benevolent despotism. I am seeing a\ngood deal of your socialists just now--& I confess that though they mean\nwell, I think they have less sense in their heads than any people I ever\nsaw.\n\nI am going to pay a little visit to those friends (friendliest of friends)\nwho live on the lonely top of a heath-covered hill--with such an outlook,\nsuch wooded slopes and broad valleys--and the storms travelling up hours\nbefore they arrive--such sweeps of sunshine too!--& they mean to drive me\nabout till I am quite strong again. So the next letter I write, dear\nFriend, shall be more cheery. I am afraid to look back lest this one\nshould read too grumbly to send. I don't feel grumbly however--only shut\nin. Herby has been working hard at getting up an exhibition here to help\nalong our Public Library. It is so very hard to stir up anything like\npublic spirit & unity of action in London or its suburbs--I suppose\nbecause of its vastness--& alas! also the social cliques & gentilities &\nsnobbishnesses. Good-bye, dearest Walt, with love from all.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXIV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Hampstead\n  May 4, '85._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nDelays of Editors--there is no end to them! I am promised now that the\nart. shall appear in the June No., & if it does I will send you at once\nthe number of copies you name. And if it does not, I think I had best get\nit back & have done with the editors of _To-day_ & try for some other &\nbetter opening again.\n\nI have been reading & re-reading & pondering over Froude's 9 vols of\nCarlyle--\"The Reminiscences,\" \"Letters,\" &c. &c.--and am pretty well at\nboiling point with indignation against Froude--boiling point of anger &\nfreezing point of contempt. His betrayal at every point of a sacred trust!\nlazy, slip-shod editing! not even taking the pains to put letters and\ntheir answers together--but printing the one in 1882 & the others three or\nfour years after--so that half the meaning and all the _mutuality_ of the\nletters are lost! And then the sly malignity of the comments with which\nthey are preceded! If I live I will do my utmost to expose all this & to\nshow that Mrs. Carlyle was no injured heroine, nor he a selfish &\nneglected husband. Both had their faults, but the balance of affection &\ntenderness was largely on his side, as well as of other great qualities:\nthough I like her too--& think she would have scorned Froude's ignoble\nchampionship.\n\nHerby has had rather better luck with his pictures this year. Has\none--\"The Sculptor's Lesson\"--fairly well hung at the Royal Academy--where\nit shines out very cheerfully & holds its own modestly, I may say without\nmaternal vanity. I think I described to you the little bit of actual life\nit depicts--a young girl he saw at the British Museum modelling a copy of\nan antique statue & young sculptor in his blouse standing below & giving\nher some animated criticism--a little bit of the Elgin marbles in the\nbackground. Herb. has also a little picture he calls \"Midsummer\"--a bit of\na very old & buttressed wall hung with roses in full bloom, & Giddy's\nfigure standing above--at the Grosvenor. Now if he has the luck to sell\ntoo! He has a commission also to paint a small portrait of me for our\nfriends at Marley, on which he is busy just now. As soon as he has a\nlittle spare money in his pocket I think his first use of it will be a run\nacross the Atlantic & a glimpse of you, dear Friend. Giddy is going to\nsing at a Soiree of socialists & revolutionary folk in general on\nWednesday. Her songs are to be \"The Wearing of the Green\"--& \"Poland\nDirge\" & the \"Marseillaise\". You will think we are getting pretty red hot!\nBut alas! though our sympathy with the Cause--the cause of suffering\nmillions--is warm, our faith in the wisdom & ability of those who are\naspiring to be the leaders, so far as we know anything of them--is\ninfinitesimal.\n\nWhat a burst of beauty we have had during the last ten days! We look out\njust now on a sea of apple & pear blossoms, from the deepest pink to\ndazzling white--& the tenderest green intermingled with all. I hope you\nare able to be out nearly all day & enjoy all--and that home affairs go\nsmoothly & comfortably & that Mrs. Davis[42] is attentive & good & every\nway adequate as care-taker.\n\nI am looking forward very much to the \"After Songs\" and \"Letters of\nParting\". Does the sale of \"Leaves of Grass\" continue pretty steady? I\nlook forward with a sort of dread to seeing my article in proof, lest I\nshould feel very disappointed with it.\n\nYour loving friend,\n\nA. GILCHRIST.\n\n\nDo you ever see or hear from Mr. Marvin? He is a favourite with all of us.\nDo you remember how we laughed at his dramatic presentation of a negro\nprayer meeting?\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXV\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _Hampstead, London\n  Jan. 21, 85._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nI hope the _To-days_ have come safe to hand. I am thinking a great deal\nabout the new edition; and cannot help hoping you are going to revert to\nthe plan of the Centennial Edition, which issued your writings in two\nindependent volumes. May I, without being presumptuous, dear Walt, tell\nyou how I should dearly like to see them arranged? I want \"Crossing\nBrooklyn Ferry,\" \"Song at Sunset,\" \"Song of the Open Road,\" \"Starting from\nPaumanok,\" \"Carol of Words,\" \"Carol of Occupations\" and either as \"As I\nSat by Blue Ontario's Shore\" or the Preface to edit. 55 put into \"Two\nRivulets\"--you could make room for them that the volumes might balance in\nsize by making them exchange places with the \"Centennial Songs\" and the\n\"Memoranda During the War\"; not that these are not precious to me, but I\nwant it dearest because I want in the Two Rivulet Volume what will best\nprepare the reader, lift him up to the true point of view, and make him\nall your own, before he comes to the inner sanctuary of \"Calamus\" & \"Walt\nWhitman\" & \"Children of Adam.\"\n\nMonday morn. Your letter just to hand. It gives me deep joy, dear Friend.\nI have sent copies of _To-Day_ to Dr. Bucke & John Burroughs but did not\nknow of his change of address; so fear it has miscarried. I will send\nanother, and also one to W. O'Connor.--You did not tell me about your\nfall--unless indeed a letter has been lost. It fills me with concern\nbecause of the difficulty it increases in getting that free out-door life\nthat is so dear & essential to your soul & body, and because, too, I still\ncherished in my heart a hope that I should yet see you again--here in my\nown home--& now it seems next to an impossibility. Right thankful am I to\nhear about Mrs. Davis--that she takes good care of you--please give her a\nfriendly greeting from me. I am going to have rather a bothersome\nsummer--first of all, the house full of workmen to make all clean & tidy;\n& then my Scotch lassie, friend & factotum rather than servant, must have\na holiday & go to her friends in Scotland for a month. I shall heartily\nwelcome your friend, no need to say, & be sure to like her. Love from\nGrace & Herb. & most of all from me. I have plenty more to say but won't\ndelay this.\n\nGood-bye, dear Walt.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER LXXVI\n\nANNE GILCHRIST TO WALT WHITMAN\n\n\n  _12 Well Rd., Hampstead, Eng.\n  July 20, '85._\n\nMY DEAREST FRIEND:\n\nA kind of anxiety has for some time past weighed upon me and upon others,\nI find, who love & admire you, that you do not have all the comforts you\nought to have; that you are perhaps sometimes straightened for means. We\nhave had letters from several young men, almost or quite strangers to us,\nasking questions on this subject; and we hoped & thought that if this were\nso, you would permit those who have received such priceless gifts from you\nto put their gratitude into some tangible shape, some \"free-will\noffering.\" Hence the paragraph was put into the _Athenaeum_ which I send\nwith this, and we were proceeding to organize our forces when your paper\ncame to hand this morning (the _Camden Post_, July 3), which seems\ndecisively to bid us desist. Or at all events wait till we had told you of\nour wishes and plan. One thing would, I feel sure, give you pleasure in\nany case; and that is to know that there is over here a little\nband--perhaps indeed it is now quite a considerable one, for we had not\nyet had time to ascertain how considerable--who would joyfully respond to\nthat Poem of yours, \"To Rich Givers.\"\n\nA friend and near neighbour of ours, Frederick Wedmore, is coming over to\nAmerica this autumn, and counts much on coming to see you. He is a\nwell-known writer on Art here--a friendly, candid, open-minded man with\nwhom, I think, you will enjoy a talk.\n\nI am on the lookout for Miss Smith[43]--shall indeed enjoy a talk with a\nspecial friend of yours, dear Walt. I hope she will not fail to come.\nGiddy is away at Haslemere. Herby just going to write for himself to you.\n\nThat is a very graphic bit in the _Post_--the portrait of Hugo, the canary\n& the kitten--I like to know all that--as well as to hear the talk.\n\nMy love, dear Walt.\n\nANNE GILCHRIST.\n\n\n\n\nSo far as can be ascertained this is the last letter.

These communications (parts of which, but in no case the whole,\nwere used by Whitman in his \"Memoranda of the Secession War\") seem to me\nto form, in spite of certain duplications, which to my mind have the\nforce, not the weakness, of repetition, quite an ideal background to the\nletters to Mrs. Whitman, since they give a full and free description of\nthe circumstances and surroundings in the midst of which those were\ncomposed. Readers who desire a still more extended account of the man\nhimself, his work and environment at that time, may consult with profit\nthe Editor's \"Walt Whitman\" (pp. 34-44), O'Connor's \"Good Gray Poet\"\n(included in that volume, pp. 99-130), \"Specimen Days\" (pp. 26-63,\nincluded in Walt Whitman's \"Complete Prose Works\"), and above all the\nsection of \"Leaves of Grass\" called \"Drum-Taps.\" I do not believe that it\nis in the power of any man now living to make an important addition to the\nvivid picture of those days and nights in the hospitals drawn by Whitman\nhimself and to be found in his published prose and verse, and, above all,\nin the living words of the present letters to his mother. These last were\nwritten on the spot, as the scenes and incidents, in all their living and\nsombre colors, passed before his eyes, while his mind and heart were full\nof the sights and sounds, the episodes and agonies, of those terrible\nhours. How could any one writing in cold blood, to-day, hope to add words\nof any value to those he wrote then?\n\nPerhaps, in conclusion, it may be as well to repeat what was said in the\nintroduction to a former volume,--that these letters make no pretensions\nas literature. They are, as indeed is all that Whitman has written (as he\nhimself has over and over again said), something quite different from\nthat--something much less to the average cultured and learned man,\nsomething much more to the man or woman who comes within range of their\nattraction. But doubtless the critics will still insist that, if they are\nnot literature, they ought to be, or otherwise should not be printed,\nfailing (as is their wont) to comprehend that there are other qualities\nand characteristics than the literary, some of them as important and as\nvaluable, which may be more or less adequately conveyed by print.\n\nR.

The soldier's hospital! how many\nsleepless nights, how many women's tears, how many long and waking hours\nand days of suspense, from every one of the Middle, Eastern, and Western\nStates, have concentrated here! Our own New York, in the form of hundreds\nand thousands of her young men, may consider herself here--Pennsylvania,\nOhio, Indiana, and all the West and Northwest the same--and all the New\nEngland States the same.\n\nUpon a few of these hospitals I have been almost daily calling as a\nmissionary, on my own account, for the sustenance and consolation of some\nof the most needy cases of sick and dying men, for the last two months.\nOne has much to learn to do good in these places. Great tact is required.\nThese are not like other hospitals. By far the greatest proportion (I\nshould say five sixths) of the patients are American young men,\nintelligent, of independent spirit, tender feelings, used to a hardy and\nhealthy life; largely the farmers are represented by their sons--largely\nthe mechanics and workingmen of the cities. Then they are soldiers. All\nthese points must be borne in mind.\n\nPeople through our Northern cities have little or no idea of the great and\nprominent feature which these military hospitals and convalescent camps\nmake in and around Washington. There are not merely two or three or a\ndozen, but some fifty of them, of different degrees of capacity. Some have\na thousand and more patients. The newspapers here find it necessary to\nprint every day a directory of the hospitals--a long list, something like\nwhat a directory of the churches would be in New York, Philadelphia, or\nBoston.\n\nThe Government (which really tries, I think, to do the best and quickest\nit can for these sad necessities) is gradually settling down to adopt the\nplan of placing the hospitals in clusters of one-story wooden barracks,\nwith their accompanying tents and sheds for cooking and all needed\npurposes. Taking all things into consideration, no doubt these are best\nadapted to the purpose; better than using churches and large public\nbuildings like the Patent office. These sheds now adopted are long,\none-story edifices, sometimes ranged along in a row, with their heads to\nthe street, and numbered either alphabetically, Wards A or B, C, D, and so\non; or Wards 1, 2, 3, etc. The middle one will be marked by a flagstaff,\nand is the office of the establishment, with rooms for the ward surgeons,\netc. One of these sheds, or wards, will contain sixty cots; sometimes, on\nan emergency, they move them close together, and crowd in more. Some of\nthe barracks are larger, with, of course, more inmates. Frequently there\nare tents, more comfortable here than one might think, whatever they may\nbe down in the army.\n\nEach ward has a ward-master, and generally a nurse for every ten or twelve\nmen. A ward surgeon has, generally, two wards--although this varies. Some\nof the wards have a woman nurse; the Armory-square wards have some very\ngood ones. The one in Ward E is one of the best.\n\nA few weeks ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of\nWashington buildings, the Patent office, was crowded close with rows of\nsick, badly wounded, and dying soldiers. They were placed in three very\nlarge apartments. I went there several times. It was a strange, solemn,\nand, with all its features of suffering and death, a sort of fascinating\nsight. I went sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases;\nsome, I found, needed a little cheering up and friendly consolation at\nthat time, for they went to sleep better afterwards. Two of the immense\napartments are filled with high and ponderous glass cases crowded with\nmodels in miniature of every kind of utensil, machine, or invention it\never entered into the mind of man to conceive, and with curiosities and\nforeign presents. Between these cases were lateral openings, perhaps\neight feet wide, and quite deep, and in these were placed many of the\nsick; besides a great long double row of them up and down through the\nmiddle of the hall. Many of them were very bad cases, wounds and\namputations. Then there was a gallery running above the hall, in which\nthere were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene at night when lit\nup. The glass cases, the beds, the sick, the gallery above and the marble\npavement under foot; the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in the\nvarious degrees; occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be\nrepressed; sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy\neyes, the nurse by his side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no\nrelative--such were the sights but lately in the Patent office. The\nwounded have since been removed from there, and it is now vacant again.\n\nOf course there are among these thousands of prostrated soldiers in\nhospital here all sorts of individual cases. On recurring to my note-book,\nI am puzzled which cases to select to illustrate the average of these\nyoung men and their experiences. I may here say, too, in general terms,\nthat I could not wish for more candor and manliness, among all their\nsufferings, than I find among them.\n\nTake this case in Ward 6, Campbell hospital: a young man from Plymouth\ncounty, Massachusetts; a farmer's son, aged about twenty or twenty-one; a\nsoldierly, American young fellow, but with sensitive and tender feelings.\nMost of December and January last he lay very low, and for quite a while\nI never expected he would recover. He had become prostrated with an\nobstinate diarrhoea: his stomach would hardly keep the least thing down;\nhe was vomiting half the time. But that was hardly the worst of it. Let me\ntell his story--it is but one of thousands.\n\nHe had been some time sick with his regiment in the field, in front, but\ndid his duty as long as he could; was in the battle of Fredericksburg;\nsoon after was put in the regimental hospital. He kept getting\nworse--could not eat anything they had there; the doctor told him nothing\ncould be done for him there. The poor fellow had fever also; received\n(perhaps it could not be helped) little or no attention; lay on the\nground, getting worse. Toward the latter part of December, very much\nenfeebled, he was sent up from the front, from Falmouth station, in an\nopen platform car (such as hogs are transported upon North), and dumped\nwith a crowd of others on the boat at Aquia creek, falling down like a rag\nwhere they deposited him, too weak and sick to sit up or help himself at\nall. No one spoke to him or assisted him; he had nothing to eat or drink;\nwas used (amid the great crowds of sick) either with perfect indifference,\nor, as in two or three instances, with heartless brutality.\n\nOn the boat, when night came and when the air grew chilly, he tried a long\ntime to undo the blankets he had in his knapsack, but was too feeble. He\nasked one of the employees, who was moving around deck, for a moment's\nassistance to get the blankets. The man asked him back if he could not get\nthem himself. He answered, no, he had been trying for more than half an\nhour, and found himself too weak. The man rejoined, he might then go\nwithout them, and walked off. So H. lay chilled and damp on deck all\nnight, without anything under or over him, while two good blankets were\nwithin reach. It caused him a great injury--nearly cost him his life.\n\nArrived at Washington, he was brought ashore and again left on the wharf,\nor above it, amid the great crowds, as before, without any\nnourishment--not a drink for his parched mouth; no kind hand had offered\nto cover his face from the forenoon sun. Conveyed at last some two miles\nby the ambulance to the hospital, and assigned a bed (Bed 49, Ward 6,\nCampbell hospital, January and February, 1863), he fell down exhausted\nupon the bed. But the ward-master (he has since been changed) came to him\nwith a growling order to get up: the rules, he said, permitted no man to\nlie down in that way with his own clothes on; he must sit up--must first\ngo to the bath-room, be washed, and have his clothes completely changed.\n(A very good rule, properly applied.) He was taken to the bath-room and\nscrubbed well with cold water. The attendants, callous for a while, were\nsoon alarmed, for suddenly the half-frozen and lifeless body fell limpsy\nin their hands, and they hurried it back to the cot, plainly insensible,\nperhaps dying.\n\nPoor boy! the long train of exhaustion, deprivation, rudeness, no food, no\nfriendly word or deed, but all kinds of upstart airs and impudent,\nunfeeling speeches and deeds, from all kinds of small officials (and some\nbig ones), cutting like razors into that sensitive heart, had at last done\nthe job. He now lay, at times out of his head but quite silent, asking\nnothing of any one, for some days, with death getting a closer and a surer\ngrip upon him; he cared not, or rather he welcomed death. His heart was\nbroken. He felt the struggle to keep up any longer to be useless. God, the\nworld, humanity--all had abandoned him. It would feel so good to shut his\neyes forever on the cruel things around him and toward him.\n\nAs luck would have it, at this time I found him. I was passing down Ward\nNo. 6 one day about dusk (4th January, I think), and noticed his glassy\neyes, with a look of despair and hopelessness, sunk low in his thin,\npallid-brown young face. One learns to divine quickly in the hospital, and\nas I stopped by him and spoke some commonplace remark (to which he made no\nreply), I saw as I looked that it was a case for ministering to the\naffection first, and other nourishment and medicines afterward. I sat down\nby him without any fuss; talked a little; soon saw that it did him good;\nled him to talk a little himself; got him somewhat interested; wrote a\nletter for him to his folks in Massachusetts (to L. H. Campbell, Plymouth\ncounty); soothed him down as I saw he was getting a little too much\nagitated, and tears in his eyes; gave him some small gifts, and told him I\nshould come again soon. (He has told me since that this little visit, at\nthat hour, just saved him; a day more, and it would have been perhaps too\nlate.)\n\nOf course I did not forget him, for he was a young fellow to interest any\none. He remained very sick--vomiting much every day, frequent diarrhoea,\nand also something like bronchitis, the doctor said. For a while I visited\nhim almost every day, cheered him up, took him some little gifts, and gave\nhim small sums of money (he relished a drink of new milk, when it was\nbrought through the ward for sale). For a couple of weeks his condition\nwas uncertain--sometimes I thought there was no chance for him at all; but\nof late he is doing better--is up and dressed, and goes around more and\nmore (February 21) every day. He will not die, but will recover.\n\nThe other evening, passing through the ward, he called me--he wanted to\nsay a few words, particular. I sat down by his side on the cot in the\ndimness of the long ward, with the wounded soldiers there in their beds,\nranging up and down. H. told me I had saved his life. He was in the\ndeepest earnest about it. It was one of those things that repay a\nsoldiers' hospital missionary a thousandfold--one of the hours he never\nforgets.\n\nA benevolent person, with the right qualities and tact, cannot, perhaps,\nmake a better investment of himself, at present, anywhere upon the varied\nsurface of the whole of this big world, than in these military hospitals,\namong such thousands of most interesting young men. The army is very\nyoung--and so much more American than I supposed. Reader, how can I\ndescribe to you the mute appealing look that rolls and moves from many a\nmanly eye, from many a sick cot, following you as you walk slowly down one\nof these wards? To see these, and to be incapable of responding to them,\nexcept in a few cases (so very few compared to the whole of the suffering\nmen), is enough to make one's heart crack. I go through in some cases,\ncheering up the men, distributing now and then little sums of money--and,\nregularly, letter-paper and envelopes, oranges, tobacco, jellies, etc.,\netc.\n\nMany things invite comment, and some of them sharp criticism, in these\nhospitals. The Government, as I said, is anxious and liberal in its\npractice toward its sick; but the work has to be left, in its personal\napplication to the men, to hundreds of officials of one grade or another\nabout the hospitals, who are sometimes entirely lacking in the right\nqualities. There are tyrants and shysters in all positions, and especially\nthose dressed in subordinate authority. Some of the ward doctors are\ncareless, rude, capricious, needlessly strict. One I found who prohibited\nthe men from all enlivening amusements; I found him sending men to the\nguard-house for the most trifling offence. In general, perhaps, the\nofficials--especially the new ones, with their straps or badges--put on\ntoo many airs. Of all places in the world, the hospitals of American young\nmen and soldiers, wounded in the volunteer service of their country, ought\nto be exempt from mere conventional military airs and etiquette of\nshoulder-straps. But they are not exempt.\n\nW. W.\n\n_From the New York_ Times, _February 26, 1863_.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE AMONG FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS\n\n\nOur Brooklyn people, not only from having so many hundreds of their own\nkith and kin, and almost everybody some friend or acquaintance, here in\nthe clustering military hospitals of Washington, would doubtless be glad\nto get some account of these establishments, but also to satisfy that\ncompound of benevolence and generosity which marks Brooklyn, I have\nsometimes thought, more than any other city in the world. A military\nhospital here in Washington is a little city by itself, and contains a\nlarger population than most of the well-known country towns down in the\nQueens and Suffolk county portions of Long Island. I say one of the\nGovernment hospitals here is a little city in itself, and there are some\nfifty of these hospitals in the District of Columbia alone. In them are\ncollected the tens of thousands of sick and wounded soldiers, the legacies\nof many a bloody battle and of the exposure of two years of camp life. I\nfind these places full of significance. They have taken up my principal\ntime and labor for some months past. Imagine a long, one-story wooden\nshed, like a short, wide ropewalk, well whitewashed; then cluster ten or a\ndozen of these together, with several smaller sheds and tents, and you\nhave the soldiers' hospital as generally adopted here. It will contain\nperhaps six or seven hundred men, or perhaps a thousand, and occasionally\nmore still. There is a regular staff and a sub-staff of big and little\nofficials. Military etiquette is observed, and it is getting to become\nvery stiff. I shall take occasion, before long, to show up some of this\nill-fitting nonsense. The harvest is large, the gleaners few. Beginning at\nfirst with casual visits to these establishments to see some of the\nBrooklyn men, wounded or sick, here, I became by degrees more and more\ndrawn in, until I have now been for many weeks quite a devotee to the\nbusiness--a regular self-appointed missionary to these thousands and tens\nof thousands of wounded and sick young men here, left upon Government\nhands, many of them languishing, many of them dying. I am not connected\nwith any society, but go on my own individual account, and to the work\nthat appears to be called for. Almost every day, and frequently in the\nevenings, I visit, in this informal way, one after another of the wards of\na hospital, and always find cases enough where I can be of service. Cases\nenough, do I say? Alas! there is, perhaps, not one ward or tent, out of\nthe seven or eight hundred now hereabout filled with sick, in which I am\nsure I might not profitably devote every hour of my life to the abstract\nwork of consolation and sustenance for its suffering inmates. And indeed,\nbeyond that, a person feels that in some one of these crowded wards he\nwould like to pick out two or three cases and devote himself wholly to\nthem. Meanwhile, however, to do the best that is permitted, I go around,\ndistributing myself and the contents of my pockets and haversack in\ninfinitesimal quantities, with faith that nearly all of it will, somehow\nor other, fall on good ground. In many cases, where I find a soldier \"dead\nbroke\" and pretty sick, I give half a tumbler of good jelly. I carry a\ngood-sized jar to a ward, have it opened, get a spoon, and taking the head\nnurse in tow, I go around and distribute it to the most appropriate cases.\nTo others I give an orange or an apple; to others some spiced fruits; to\nothers a small quantity of pickles. Many want tobacco: I do not encourage\nany of the boys in its use, but where I find they crave it I supply them.\nI always carry some, cut up in small plugs, in my pocket. Then I have\ncommissions: some New York or Connecticut, or other soldier, will be going\nhome on sick leave, or perhaps discharged, and I must fit him out with\ngood new undershirt, drawers, stockings, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest welcome is for writing paper, envelopes, etc. I\nfind these always a rare reliance. When I go into a new ward, I always\ncarry two or three quires of paper and a good lot of envelopes, and walk\nup and down and circulate them around to those who desire them. Then some\nwill want pens, pencils, etc. In some hospitals there is quite a plenty of\nreading matter; but others, where it is needed, I supply.\n\nBy these and like means one comes to be better acquainted with individual\ncases, and so learns every day peculiar and interesting character, and\ngets on intimate and soon affectionate terms with noble American young\nmen; and now is where the real good begins to be done, after all. Here, I\nwill egotistically confess, I like to flourish. Even in a medical point of\nview it is one of the greatest things; and in a surgical point of view,\nthe same. I can testify that friendship has literally cured a fever, and\nthe medicine of daily affection, a bad wound. In these sayings are the\nfinal secret of carrying out well the role of a hospital missionary for\nour soldiers, which I tell for those who will understand them.\n\nAs I write, I have lying before me a little discarded note-book, filled\nwith memoranda of things wanted by the sick--special cases. I use up one\nof these little books in a week. See from this sample, for instance, after\nwalking through a ward or two: Bed 53 wants some liquorice; Bed\n6--erysipelas--bring some raspberry vinegar to make a cooling drink, with\nwater; Bed 18 wants a good book--a romance; Bed 25--a manly, friendly\nyoung fellow, H. D. B., of the Twenty-seventh Connecticut, an independent\nyoung soul--refuses money and eatables, so I will bring him a pipe and\ntobacco, for I see he much enjoys a smoke; Bed 45--sore throat and\ncough--wants horehound candy; Bed 11, when I come again, don't forget to\nwrite a letter for him; etc. The wants are a long and varied list: some\nneed to be humored and forgotten, others need to be especially remembered\nand obeyed. One poor German, dying--in the last stage of\nconsumption--wished me to find him, in Washington, a German Lutheran\nclergyman, and send him to him; I did so. One patient will want nothing\nbut a toothpick, another a comb, and so on. All whims are represented, and\nall the States. There are many New York State soldiers here; also\nPennsylvanians. I find, of course, many from Massachusetts, Connecticut,\nand all the New England States, and from the Western and Northwestern\nStates. Five sixths of the soldiers are young men.\n\nAmong other cases of young men from our own city of Brooklyn I have\nencountered and have had much to do with in hospital here, is John Lowery,\nwounded, and arm amputated, at Fredericksburg. I saw this young fellow\ndown there last December, immediately after the battle, lying on a blanket\non the ground, the stump of his arm bandaged, but he not a bit\ndisheartened. He was soon afterward sent up from the front by way of Aquia\ncreek, and has for the past three months been in the Campbell hospital\nhere, in Ward 6, on the gain slowly but steadily. He thinks a great deal\nof his physician here, Dr. Frank Hinkle, and as some fifty other soldiers\nin the ward do the same, and bear testimony in their hearty gratitude, and\nmedical and surgical imprisonment, to the quality of Dr. H., I think he\ndeserves honorable mention in this letter to the people of our\ncity--especially as another Brooklyn soldier in Ward 6, Amos H. Vliet,\nexpresses the same feeling of obligation to the doctor for his\nfaithfulness and kindness. Vliet and Lowery both belong to that old war\nregiment whose flag has flaunted through more than a score of\nhot-contested battles, the Fifty-first New York, Colonel Potter; and it is\nto be remembered that no small portion of the fame of this old veteran\nregiment may be claimed near home, for many of her officers and men are\nfrom Brooklyn. The friends of these two young soldiers will have a chance\nto talk to them soon in Brooklyn. I have seen a good deal of Jack Lowery,\nand I find him, and heard of him on the field, as a brave, soldierly\nfellow. Amos Vliet, too, made a first-rate soldier. He has had frozen feet\npretty bad, but now better. Occasionally I meet some of the Brooklyn\nFourteenth. In Ward E of Armory hospital I found a member of Company C of\nthat regiment, Isaac Snyder; he is now acting as nurse there, and makes a\nvery good one. Charles Dean, of Co. H of the same regiment, is in Ward A\nof Armory, acting as ward-master. I also got very well acquainted with a\nyoung man of the Brooklyn Fourteenth who lay sick some time in Ward F; he\nhas lately got his discharge and gone home. I have met with others in the\nH-street and Patent-office hospitals. Colonel Fowler, of the Fourteenth,\nis in charge, I believe, of the convalescent camp at Alexandria.\nLieutenant-Colonel Debevoise is in Brooklyn, in poor health, I am sorry to\nsay. Thus the Brooklyn invalids are scattered around.\n\nOff in the mud, a mile east of the Capitol, I found the other day, in\nEmory hospital there, in Ward C, three Brooklyn soldiers--Allen V. King,\nMichael Lally, and Patrick Hennessy; none of them, however, are very sick.\n\nAt a rough guess, I should say I have met from one hundred and fifty to\ntwo hundred young and middle-aged men whom I specifically found to be\nBrooklyn persons. Many of them I recognized as having seen their faces\nbefore, and very many of them knew me. Some said they had known me from\nboyhood. Some would call to me as I passed down a ward, and tell me they\nhad seen me in Brooklyn. I have had this happen at night, and have been\nentreated to stop and sit down and take the hand of a sick and restless\nboy, and talk to him and comfort him awhile, for old Brooklyn's sake.\n\nSome pompous and every way improper persons, of course, get in power in\nhospitals, and have full swing over the helpless soldiers. There is great\nstate kept at Judiciary-square hospital, for instance. An individual who\nprobably has been waiter somewhere for years past has got into the high\nand mighty position of sergeant-of-arms at this hospital; he is called\n\"Red Stripe\" (from his artillery trimmings) by the patients, of whom he is\nat the same time the tyrant and the laughing-stock. Going in to call on\nsome sick New York soldiers here the other afternoon, I was stopped and\ntreated to a specimen of the airs of this powerful officer. Surely the\nGovernment would do better to send such able-bodied loafers down into\nservice in front, where they could earn their rations, than keep them here\nin the idle and shallow sinecures of military guard over a collection of\nsick soldiers to give insolence to their visitors and friends. I found a\nshallow old person also here named Dr. Hall, who told me he had been\neighteen years in the service. I must give this Judiciary establishment\nthe credit, from my visits to it, of saying that while in all the other\nhospitals I met with general cordiality and deference among the doctors,\nward officers, nurses, etc., I have found more impudence and more dandy\ndoctorism and more needless airs at this Judiciary, than in all the\ntwoscore other establishments in and around Washington. But the corps of\nmanagement at the Judiciary has a bad name anyhow, and I only specify it\nhere to put on record the general opinion, and in hopes it may help in\ncalling the attention of the Government to a remedy. For this hospital is\nhalf filled with New York soldiers, many noble fellows, and many sad and\ninteresting cases. Of course there are exceptions of good officials here,\nand some of the women nurses are excellent, but the Empire State has no\nreason to be over-satisfied with this hospital.\n\nBut I should say, in conclusion, that the earnest and continued desire of\nthe Government, and much devoted labor, are given to make the military\nhospitals here as good as they can be, considering all things. I find no\nexpense spared, and great anxiety manifested in the highest quarters, to\ndo well by the national sick. I meet with first-class surgeons in charge\nof many of the hospitals, and often the ward surgeons, medical cadets,\nand head nurses, are fully faithful and competent. Dr. Bliss, head of\nArmory-square, and Dr. Baxter, head of Campbell, seem to me to try to do\ntheir best, and to be excellent in their posts. Dr. Bowen, one of the ward\nsurgeons of Armory, I have known to fight as hard for many a poor fellow's\nlife under his charge as a lioness would fight for her young. I mention\nsuch cases because I think they deserve it, on public grounds.\n\nI thought I would include in my letter a few cases of soldiers, especially\ninteresting, out of my note-book, but I find that my story has already\nbeen spun out to sufficient length. I shall continue here in Washington\nfor the present, and may-be for the summer, to work as a missionary, after\nmy own style, among these hospitals, for I find it in some respects\ncuriously fascinating, with all its sadness. Nor do I find it ended by my\ndoing some good to the sick and dying soldiers. They do me good in return,\nmore than I do them.\n\nW. W.\n\n_From the Brooklyn_ Eagle, _March 19, 1863_.\n\n\n\n\nHOSPITAL VISITS\n\n\nAs this tremendous war goes on, the public interest becomes more general\nand gathers more and more closely about the wounded, the sick, and the\nGovernment hospitals, the surgeons, and all appertaining to the medical\ndepartment of the army. Up to the date of this writing (December 9, 1864)\nthere have been, as I estimate, near four hundred thousand cases under\ntreatment, and there are to-day, probably, taking the whole service of the\nUnited States, two hundred thousand, or an approximation to that number,\non the doctors' list. Half of these are comparatively slight ailments or\nhurts. Every family has directly or indirectly some representative among\nthis vast army of the wounded and sick.\n\nThe following sketch is made to gratify the general interest in this field\nof the war, and also for a few special persons through whose means alone I\nhave aided the men. It extends over a period of two years, coming down to\nthe present hour, and exhibits the army hospitals at Washington, the camp\nhospitals in the field, etc. A very few cases are given as specimens of\nthousands. The account may be relied upon as faithful, though rapidly\nthrown together. It will put the reader in as direct contact as may be\nwith scenes, sights, and cases of these immense hospitals. As will be\nseen, it begins back two years since, at a very gloomy period of the\ncontest.\n\nBegan my visits (December 21, 1862) among the camp hospitals in the Army\nof the Potomac, under General Burnside. Spent a good part of the day in a\nlarge brick mansion on the banks of the Rappahannock, immediately opposite\nFredericksburg. It is used as a hospital since the battle, and seems to\nhave received only the worst cases. Outdoors, at the foot of a tree,\nwithin ten yards of the front of the house, I notice a heap of amputated\nfeet, legs, arms, hands, etc.--about a load for a one-horse cart. Several\ndead bodies lie near, each covered with its brown woollen blanket. In the\ndooryard, toward the river, are fresh graves, mostly of officers, their\nnames on pieces of barrel staves or broken board, stuck in the dirt. (Most\nof these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported North to their\nfriends.)\n\nThe house is quite crowded, everything impromptu, no system, all bad\nenough, but I have no doubt the best that can be done; all the wounds\npretty bad, some frightful, the men in their old clothes, unclean and\nbloody. Some of the wounded are rebel officers, prisoners. One, a\nMississippian--a captain--hit badly in the leg, I talked with some time;\nhe asked me for papers, which I gave him. (I saw him three months\nafterward in Washington, with leg amputated, doing well.)\n\nI went through the rooms, down stairs and up. Some of the men were dying.\nI had nothing to give at that visit, but wrote a few letters to folks\nhome, mothers, etc. Also talked to three or four who seemed most\nsusceptible to it, and needing it.\n\nDecember 22 to 31.--Am among the regimental brigade and division hospitals\nsomewhat. Few at home realize that these are merely tents, and sometimes\nvery poor ones, the wounded lying on the ground, lucky if their blanket is\nspread on a layer of pine or hemlock twigs, or some leaves. No cots;\nseldom even a mattress on the ground. It is pretty cold. I go around from\none case to another. I do not see that I can do any good, but I cannot\nleave them. Once in a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively,\nand I do what I can for him; at any rate stop with him, and sit near him\nfor hours, if he wishes it.\n\nBesides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the\ncamps, talking with the men, etc.; sometimes at night among the groups\naround the fires, in their shebang enclosures of bushes. I soon get\nacquainted anywhere in camp with officers or men, and am always well used.\nSometimes I go down on picket with the regiments I know best.\n\nAs to rations, the army here at present seems to be tolerably well\nsupplied, and the men have enough, such as it is. Most of the regiments\nlodge in the flimsy little shelter tents. A few have built themselves huts\nof logs and mud, with fireplaces.\n\nI might give a long list of special cases, interesting items of the\nwounded men here, but have not space.\n\nLeft Falmouth, January, 1863, by Aquia creek railroad, and so on\nGovernment steamer up the Potomac. Many wounded were with us on cars and\nboat. The cars were just common platform ones. The railroad journey of ten\nor twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The soldiers guarding the\nroad came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and\nhalf-awake look. Those on duty were walking their posts, some on banks\nover us, others down far below the level of the track. I saw large cavalry\ncamps off the road. At Aquia Creek Landing were numbers of wounded going\nNorth. While I waited some three hours, I went around among them. Several\nwanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives, etc., which I did for\nthem (by mail the next day from Washington). On the boat I had my hands\nfull. One poor fellow died going up.\n\nAm now (January, February, etc., 1863) in and around Washington, daily\nvisiting the hospitals. Am much in Campbell, Patent-office, Eighth-street,\nH-street, Armory-square, and others. Am now able to do a little good,\nhaving money (as almoner of others home), and getting experience. I would\nlike to give lists of cases, for there is no end to the interesting ones;\nbut it is impossible without making a large volume, or rather several\nvolumes. I must, therefore, let one or two days' visits at this time\nsuffice as specimens of scores and hundreds of subsequent ones, through\nthe ensuing spring, summer, and fall, and, indeed, down to the present\nweek.\n\nSunday, January 25.--Afternoon and till 9 in the evening, visited Campbell\nhospital. Attended specially to one case in Ward I, very sick with\npleurisy and typhoid fever, young man, farmer's son--D. F. Russell,\nCompany E, Sixtieth New York--down-hearted and feeble; a long time before\nhe would take any interest; soothed and cheered him gently; wrote a letter\nhome to his mother, in Malone, Franklin county, N. Y., at his request;\ngave him some fruit and one or two other gifts; enveloped and directed his\nletter, etc. Then went thoroughly through Ward 6; observed every case in\nthe ward (without, I think, missing one); found some cases I thought\nneeded little sums of money; supplied them (sums of perhaps thirty,\ntwenty-five, twenty, or fifteen cents); distributed a pretty bountiful\nsupply of cheerful reading matter, and gave perhaps some twenty to thirty\npersons, each one some little gift, such as oranges, apples, sweet\ncrackers, figs, etc., etc., etc.\n\nThursday, January 29.--Devoted the main part of the day, from 11 to 3.30\no'clock, to Armory-square hospital; went pretty thoroughly through Wards\nF, G, H, and I--some fifty cases in each ward. In Ward H supplied the men\nthroughout with writing paper and a stamped envelope each, also some\ncheerful reading matter; distributed in small portions, about half of it\nin this ward, to proper subjects, a large jar of first-rate preserved\nberries; also other small gifts. In Wards G, H, and I, found several cases\nI thought good subjects for small sums of money, which I furnished in each\ncase. The poor wounded men often come up \"dead broke,\" and it helps their\nspirits to have even the small sum I give them. My paper and envelopes all\ngone, but distributed a good lot of amusing reading matter; also, as I\nthought judicious, tobacco, oranges, apples, etc. Some very interesting\ncases in Ward I: Charles Miller, Bed No. 19, Company D, Fifty-third\nPennsylvania, is only sixteen years of age, very bright, courageous boy,\nleft leg amputated below the knee; next bed below him, young lad very\nsick--gave the two each appropriate gifts; in the bed above also\namputation of the left leg--gave him a part of a jar of raspberries; Bed\nNo. 1, this ward, gave a small sum also; also to a soldier on crutches,\nsitting on his bed near.\n\nEvening, same day.--Went to see D. F. R., Campbell hospital, before\nalluded to; found him remarkably changed for the better--up and dressed\n(quite a triumph; he afterwards got well and went back to his regiment).\nDistributed in the wards a quantity of note-paper and forty or fifty,\nmostly paid, envelopes, of which the men were much in need; also a\nfour-pound bag of gingersnaps I bought at a baker's in Seventh street.\n\nHere is a case of a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the Patent\nhospital--(they have removed most of the men of late and broken up that\nhospital). He likes to have some one to talk to, and we will listen to\nhim. He got badly wounded in the leg and side at Fredericksburg that\neventful Saturday, 13th December. He lay the succeeding two days and\nnights helpless on the field, between the city and those grim batteries,\nfor his company and his regiment had been compelled to leave him to his\nfate. To make matters worse, he lay with his head slightly down hill, and\ncould not help himself. At the end of some fifty hours he was brought off,\nwith other wounded, under a flag of truce.\n\nWe ask him how the Rebels treated him during those two days and nights\nwithin reach of them--whether they came to him--whether they abused him?\nHe answers that several of the Rebels, soldiers and others, came to him,\nat one time and another. A couple of them, who were together, spoke\nroughly and sarcastically, but did no act. One middle-aged man, however,\nwho seemed to be moving around the field among the dead and wounded for\nbenevolent purposes, came to him in a way he will never forget. This man\ntreated our soldier kindly, bound up his wounds, cheered him, gave him a\ncouple of biscuits gave him a drink of whiskey and water, asked him if he\ncould eat some beef. This good Secesh, however, did not change our\nsoldier's position, for it might have caused the blood to burst from the\nwounds where they were clotted and stagnated. Our soldier is from\nPennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time; the wounds proved to be bad\nones. But he retains a good heart, and is at present on the gain.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way, one, two,\nor even four or five days.\n\nI continue among the hospitals during March, April, etc., without\nintermission. My custom is to go through a ward, or a collection of wards,\nendeavoring to give some trifle to each, without missing any. Even a sweet\nbiscuit, a sheet of paper, or a passing word of friendliness, or but a\nlook or nod, if no more. In this way I go through large numbers without\ndelaying, yet do not hurry. I find out the general mood of the ward at the\ntime; sometimes see that there is a heavy weight of listlessness\nprevailing, and the whole ward wants cheering up. I perhaps read to the\nmen, to break the spell, calling them around me, careful to sit away from\nthe cot of any one who is very bad with sickness or wounds. Also I find\nout, by going through in this way, the cases that need special attention,\nand can then devote proper time to them. Of course I am very cautious,\namong the patients, in giving them food. I always confer with the doctor,\nor find out from the nurse or ward-master about a new case. But I soon get\nsufficiently familiar with what is to be avoided, and learn also to judge\nalmost intuitively what is best.\n\nI do a good deal of writing letters by the bedside, of course--writing all\nkinds, including love letters. Many sick and wounded soldiers have not\nwritten home to parents, brothers, sisters, and even wives, for one reason\nor another, for a long, long time. Some are poor writers; some cannot get\npaper and envelopes; many have an aversion to writing, because they dread\nto worry the folks at home--the facts about them are so sad to tell. I\nalways encourage the men to write, and promptly write for them.\n\nAs I write this, in May, 1863, the wounded have begun to arrive from\nHooker's command, from bloody Chancellorsville. I was down among the first\narrivals. The men in charge of them told me the bad cases were yet to\ncome. If that is so, I pity them, for these are bad enough. You ought to\nsee the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here, foot of Sixth\nstreet, at night. Two boat-loads came about half-past seven last night. A\nlittle after eight it rained, a long and violent shower. The poor, pale,\nhelpless soldiers had been debarked, and lay around on the wharf and\nneighborhood, anywhere. The rain was, probably, grateful to them; at any\nrate they were exposed to it.\n\nThe few torches light up the spectacle. All around on the wharf, on the\nground, out on side places, etc., the men are lying on blankets, old\nquilts, etc., with the bloody rags bound around their heads, arms, legs,\netc. The attendants are few, and at night few outsiders also--only a few\nhard-worked transportation men and drivers. (The wounded are getting to be\ncommon, and people grow callous.) The men, whatever their condition, lie\nthere and patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up. Near by the\nambulances are now arriving in clusters, and one after another is called\nto back up and take its load. Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers.\nThe men generally make little or no ado, whatever their sufferings--a few\ngroans that cannot be repressed, and occasionally a scream of pain as they\nlift a man into the ambulance.\n\nTo-day, as I write, hundreds more are expected; and to-morrow and the next\nday more, and so on for many days.\n\nThe soldiers are nearly all young men, and far more Americans than is\ngenerally supposed--I should say nine tenths are native born. Among the\narrivals from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of Ohio, Indiana,\nand Illinois men. As usual there are all sorts of wounds. Some of the men\nare fearfully burnt from the explosion of artillery caissons. One ward has\na long row of officers, some with ugly hurts. Yesterday was perhaps worse\nthan usual: amputations are going on; the attendants are dressing wounds.\nAs you pass by you must be on your guard where you look. I saw, the other\nday, a gentleman, a visitor, apparently from curiosity, in one of the\nwards, stop and turn a moment to look at an awful wound they were probing,\netc.; he turned pale, and in a moment more he had fainted away and fallen\non the floor.\n\nI buy, during the hot weather, boxes of oranges from time to time, and\ndistribute them among the men; also preserved peaches and other fruits;\nalso lemons and sugar for lemonade. Tobacco is also much in demand. Large\nnumbers of the men come up, as usual, without a cent of money. Through the\nassistance of friends in Brooklyn and Boston, I am again able to help many\nof those that fall in my way. It is only a small sum in each case, but it\nis much to them. As before, I go around daily and talk with the men, to\ncheer them up.\n\nMy note-books are full of memoranda of the cases of this summer, and the\nwounded from Chancellorsville, but space forbids my transcribing them.\n\nAs I sit writing this paragraph (sundown, Thursday, June 25) I see a train\nof about thirty huge four-horse wagons, used as ambulances, filled with\nwounded, passing up Fourteenth street, on their way, probably, to\nColumbian, Carver, and Mount Pleasant hospitals. This is the way the men\ncome in now, seldom in small numbers, but almost always in these long, sad\nprocessions. Through the past winter, while our army lay opposite\nFredericksburg, the like strings of ambulances were of frequent occurrence\nalong Seventh street, passing slowly up from the steam-boat wharf, from\nAquia creek.\n\nThis afternoon, July 22, 1863, I spent a long time with a young man I have\nbeen with considerable, named Oscar F. Wilber, Company G, One Hundred\nFifty-fourth New York, low with chronic diarrhoea and a bad wound also.\nHe asked me to read him a chapter in the New Testament. I complied and\nasked him what I should read. He said, \"Make your own choice.\" I opened at\nthe close of one of the first books of the Evangelists, and read the\nchapters describing the latter hours of Christ and the scenes at the\ncrucifixion. The poor wasted young man asked me to read the following\nchapter also, how Christ rose again. I read very slowly, for Oscar was\nfeeble. It pleased him very much, yet the tears were in his eyes. He asked\nme if I enjoyed religion. I said, \"Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you\nmean, and yet may-be it is the same thing.\" He said, \"It is my chief\nreliance.\" He talked of death, and said he did not fear it. I said, \"Why,\nOscar, don't you think you will get well?\" He said, \"I may, but it is not\nprobable.\" He spoke calmly of his condition. The wound was very bad; it\ndischarged much. Then the diarrhoea had prostrated him, and I felt that\nhe was even then the same as dying. He behaved very manly and\naffectionate. The kiss I gave him as I was about leaving, he returned\nfourfold. He gave me his mother's address, Mrs. Sally D. Wilber, Alleghany\npost-office, Cattaraugus county, N. Y. I had several such interviews with\nhim. He died a few days after the one just described.\n\nAugust, September, October, etc.--I continue among the hospitals in the\nsame manner, getting still more experience, and daily and nightly meeting\nwith most interesting cases. Through the winter of 1863-4, the same. The\nwork of the army hospital visitor is indeed a trade, an art, requiring\nboth experience and natural gifts, and the greatest judgment. A large\nnumber of the visitors to the hospitals do no good at all, while many do\nharm. The surgeons have great trouble from them. Some visitors go from\ncuriosity--as to a show of animals. Others give the men improper things.\nThen there are always some poor fellows, in the crises of sickness or\nwounds, that imperatively need perfect quiet--not to be talked to by\nstrangers. Few realize that it is not the mere giving of gifts that does\ngood; it is the proper adaption. Nothing is of any avail among the\nsoldiers except conscientious personal investigation of cases, each for\nitself; with sharp, critical faculties, but in the fullest spirit of human\nsympathy and boundless love. The men feel such love more than anything\nelse. I have met very few persons who realize the importance of humoring\nthe yearnings for love and friendship of these American young men,\nprostrated by sickness and wounds.\n\nFebruary, 1864.--I am down at Culpepper and Brandy station, among the camp\nof First, Second, and Third Corps, and going through the division\nhospitals. The condition of the camps here this winter is immensely\nimproved from last winter near Falmouth. All the army is now in huts of\nlogs and mud, with fireplaces; and the food is plentiful and tolerably\ngood. In the camp hospitals I find diarrhoea more and more prevalent,\nand in chronic form. It is at present the great disease of the army. I\nthink the doctors generally give too much medicine, oftener making things\nworse. Then they hold on to the cases in camp too long. When the disease\nis almost fixed beyond remedy, they send it up to Washington. Alas! how\nmany such wrecks have I seen landed from boat and railroad and deposited\nin the Washington hospitals, mostly but to linger awhile and die, after\nbeing kept at the front too long.\n\nThe hospitals in front, this winter, are also much improved. The men have\ncots, and often wooden floors, and the tents are well warmed.\n\nMarch and April, 1864.--Back again in Washington. They are breaking up the\ncamp hospitals in Meade's army, preparing for a move. As I write this, in\nMarch, there are all the signs. Yesterday and last night the sick were\narriving here in long trains, all day and night. I was among the\nnew-comers most of the night. One train of a thousand came into the depot,\nand others followed. The ambulances were going all night, distributing\nthem to the various hospitals here. When they come in, some literally in a\ndying condition, you may well imagine it is a lamentable sight. I hardly\nknow which is worse, to see the wounded after a battle, or these wasted\nwrecks.\n\nI remain in capital health and strength, and go every day, as before,\namong the men, in my own way, enjoying my life and occupation more than I\ncan tell.\n\nOf the army hospitals now in and around Washington, there are thirty or\nforty. I am in the habit of going to all, and to Fairfax seminary,\nAlexandria, and over Long Bridge to the convalescent camp, etc. As a\nspecimen of almost any one of these hospitals, fancy to yourself a space\nof three to twenty acres of ground, on which are grouped ten or twelve\nvery large wooden barracks, with, perhaps, a dozen or twenty, and\nsometimes more than that number, of small buildings, capable all together\nof accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred\npersons. Sometimes these large wooden barracks, or wards, each of them,\nperhaps, from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long, are arranged in\na straight row, evenly fronting the street; others are planned so as to\nform an immense V; and others again arranged around a hollow square. They\nmake all together a huge cluster, with the additional tents, extra wards\nfor contagious diseases, guard-houses, sutler's stores, chaplain's house,\netc. In the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the offices of\nthe surgeon in charge and the ward surgeons, principal attaches, clerks,\netc. Then around this centre radiate or are gathered the wards for the\nwounded and sick.\n\nThese wards are either lettered alphabetically, Ward G, Ward K, or else\nnumerically, 1, 2, 3, etc. Each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses.\nOf course there is, in the aggregate, quite a muster of employees, and\nover all the surgeon in charge. Any one of these hospitals is a little\ncity in itself. Take, for instance, the Carver hospital, out a couple of\nmiles, on a hill, northern part of Fourteenth street. It has more inmates\nthan an ordinary country town. The same with the Lincoln hospital, east of\nthe Capitol, or the Finley hospital, on high grounds northeast of the\ncity; both large establishments. Armory-square hospital, under Dr. Bliss,\nin Seventh street (one of the best anywhere), is also temporarily enlarged\nthis summer, with additional tents, sheds, etc. It must have nearly a\nhundred tents, wards, sheds, and structures of one kind and another. The\nworst cases are always to be found here. A wanderer like me about\nWashington pauses on some high land which commands the sweep of the city\n(one never tires of the noble and ample views presented here, in the\ngenerally fine, soft, peculiar air and light), and has his eyes attracted\nby these white clusters of barracks in almost every direction. They make a\ngreat show in the landscape, and I often use them as landmarks. Some of\nthese clusters are very full of inmates. Counting the whole, with the\nconvalescent camps (whose inmates are often worse off than the sick in the\nhospitals), they have numbered, in this quarter and just down the Potomac,\nas high as fifty thousand invalid, disabled, or sick and dying men.\n\nMy sketch has already filled up so much room that I shall have to omit\nany detailed account of the wounded of May and June, 1864, from the\nbattles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, etc. That would be a long\nhistory in itself. The arrivals, the numbers, and the severity of the\nwounds, out-viewed anything that we have seen before. For days and weeks a\nmelancholy tide set in upon us. The weather was very hot. The wounded had\nbeen delayed in coming, and much neglected. Very many of the wounds had\nworms in them. An unusual proportion mortified. It was among these that,\nfor the first time in my life, I began to be prostrated with real\nsickness, and was, before the close of the summer, imperatively ordered\nNorth by the physician to recuperate and have an entire change of air.\n\nWhat I know of first Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Wilderness, etc.,\nmakes clear to me that there has been, and is yet, a total lack of science\nin elastic adaptation to the needs of the wounded after a battle. The\nhospitals are long afterward filled with proofs of this.\n\nI have seen many battles, their results, but never one where there was\nnot, during the first few days, an unaccountable and almost total\ndeficiency of everything for the wounded--appropriate sustenance, nursing,\ncleaning, medicines, stores, etc. (I do not say surgical attendance,\nbecause the surgeons cannot do more than human endurance permits.)\nWhatever pleasant accounts there may be in the papers of the North, this\nis the actual fact. No thorough previous preparation, no system, no\nforesight, no genius. Always plenty of stores, no doubt, but always miles\naway; never where they are needed, and never the proper application. Of\nall harrowing experiences, none is greater than that of the days following\na heavy battle. Scores, hundreds, of the noblest young men on earth,\nuncomplaining, lie helpless, mangled, faint, alone, and so bleed to death,\nor die from exhaustion, either actually untouched at all, or with merely\nthe laying of them down and leaving them, when there ought to be means\nprovided to save them.\n\nThe reader has doubtless inferred the fact that my visits among the\nwounded and sick have been as an independent missionary, in my own style,\nand not as an agent of any commission. Several noble women and men of\nBrooklyn, Boston, Salem, and Providence, have voluntarily supplied funds\nat times. I only wish they could see a tithe of the actual work performed\nby their generous and benevolent assistance among the suffering men.\n\nHe who goes among the soldiers with gifts, etc., must beware how he\nproceeds. It is much more of an art than one would imagine. They are not\ncharity-patients, but American young men, of pride and independence. The\nspirit in which you treat them, and bestow your donations, is just as\nimportant as the gifts themselves; sometimes more so. Then there is\ncontinual discrimination necessary. Each case requires some peculiar\nadaptation to itself. It is very important to slight nobody--not a single\ncase. Some hospital visitors, especially the women, pick out the\nhandsomest looking soldiers, or have a few for their pets. Of course some\nwill attract you more than others, and some will need more attention than\nothers; but be careful not to ignore any patient. A word, a friendly turn\nof the eye or touch of the hand in passing, if nothing more.\n\nOne hot day toward the middle of June I gave the inmates of Carver\nhospital a general ice-cream treat, purchasing a large quantity, and going\naround personally through the wards to see to its distribution.\n\nHere is a characteristic scene in a ward: It is Sunday afternoon (middle\nof summer, 1864), hot and oppressive, and very silent through the ward. I\nam taking care of a critical case, now lying in a half lethargy. Near\nwhere I sit is a suffering Rebel from the Eighth Louisiana; his name is\nIrving. He has been here a long time, badly wounded, and lately had his\nleg amputated. It is not doing very well. Right opposite me is a sick\nsoldier boy laid down with his clothes on, sleeping, looking much wasted,\nhis pallid face on his arm. I see by the yellow trimming on his jacket\nthat he is a cavalry boy. He looks so handsome as he sleeps, one must\nneeds go nearer to him. I step softly over, and find by his card that he\nis named William Cone, of the First Maine Cavalry, and his folks live in\nSkowhegan.\n\nWell, poor John Mahay is dead. He died yesterday. His was a painful and\nlingering case. I have been with him at times for the past fifteen\nmonths. He belonged to Company A, One Hundred and First New York, and was\nshot through the lower region of the abdomen at second Bull Run, August,\n1862. One scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of nearly two\nyears. The bladder had been perforated by a bullet going entirely through\nhim. Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by his bedside, Ward\nE, Armory-square; the water ran out of his eyes from the intense pain, and\nthe muscles of his face were distorted, but he utters nothing except a low\ngroan now and then. Hot moist cloths were applied, and relieved him\nsomewhat. Poor Mahay, a mere boy in age, but old in misfortune, he never\nknew the love of parents, was placed in his infancy in one of the New York\ncharitable institutions, and subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master\nin Sullivan county (the scars of whose cowhide and club remained yet on\nhis back). His wound here was a most disagreeable one, for he was a\ngentle, cleanly, and affectionate boy. He found friends in his hospital\nlife, and, indeed, was a universal favorite. He had quite a funeral\nceremony.\n\nThrough Fourteenth street to the river, and then over the long bridge and\nsome three miles beyond, is the huge collection called the convalescent\ncamp. It is a respectable sized army in itself, for these hospitals,\ntents, sheds, etc., at times contain from five to ten thousand men. Of\ncourse there are continual changes. Large squads are sent off to their\nregiments or elsewhere, and new men received. Sometimes I found large\nnumbers of paroled returned prisoners here.\n\nDuring October, November, and December, 1864, I have visited the military\nhospitals about New York City, but have not room in this article to\ndescribe these visits.\n\nI have lately been (November 25) in the Central-park hospital, near One\nHundred and Fourth street; it seems to be a well-managed institution.\nDuring September, and previously, went many times to the Brooklyn city\nhospital, in Raymond street, where I found (taken in by contract) a number\nof wounded and sick from the army. Most of the men were badly off, and\nwithout a cent of money, many wanting tobacco. I supplied them, and a few\nspecial cases with delicacies; also repeatedly with letter-paper, stamps,\nenvelopes, etc., writing the addresses myself plainly--(a pleased crowd\ngathering around me as I directed for each one in turn.) This Brooklyn\nhospital is a bad place for soldiers, or anybody else. Cleanliness, proper\nnursing, watching, etc., are more deficient than in any hospital I know.\nFor dinner on Sundays I invariably found nothing but rice and molasses.\nThe men all speak well of Drs. Yale and Kissam for kindness, patience,\netc., and I think, from what I saw, there are also young medical men. In\nits management otherwise, this is the poorest hospital I have been in, out\nof many hundreds.\n\nAmong places, apart from soldiers', visited lately (December 7) I must\nspecially mention the great Brooklyn general hospital and other public\ninstitutions at Flatbush, including the extensive lunatic asylum, under\ncharge of Drs. Chapin and Reynolds. Of the latter (and I presume I might\ninclude these county establishments generally) I have deliberately to put\non record about the profoundest satisfaction with professional capacity,\ncompleteness of house arrangements to ends required, and the right vital\nspirit animating all, that I have yet found in any public curative\ninstitution among civilians.\n\nIn Washington, in camp and everywhere, I was in the habit of reading to\nthe men. They were very fond of it, and liked declamatory, poetical\npieces. Miles O'Reilly's pieces were also great favorites. I have had many\nhappy evenings with the men. We would gather in a large group by\nourselves, after supper, and spend the time in such readings, or in\ntalking, and occasionally by an amusing game called the game of Twenty\nQuestions.\n\nFor nurses, middle-aged women and mothers of families are best. I am\ncompelled to say young ladies, however refined, educated, and benevolent,\ndo not succeed as army nurses, though their motives are noble; neither do\nthe Catholic nuns, among these home-born American young men. Mothers full\nof motherly feeling, and however illiterate, but bringing reminiscences of\nhome, and with the magnetic touch of hands, are the true women nurses.\nMany of the wounded are between fifteen and twenty years of age.\n\nI should say that the Government, from my observation, is always full of\nanxiety and liberality toward the sick and wounded. The system in\noperation in the permanent hospitals is good, and the money flows without\nstint. But the details have to be left to hundreds and thousands of\nsubordinates and officials. Among these, laziness, heartlessness, gouging,\nand incompetency are more or less prevalent. Still, I consider the\npermanent hospitals, generally, well conducted.\n\nA very large proportion of the wounded come up from the front without a\ncent of money in their pockets. I soon discovered that it was about the\nbest thing I could do to raise their spirits and show them that somebody\ncared for them, and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly interest in\nthem, to give them small sums, in such cases, using tact and discretion\nabout it.\n\nA large majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs. But there is\nevery kind of wound in every part of the body. I should say of the sick,\nfrom my experience in the hospitals, that the prevailing maladies are\ntyphoid fever and the camp fevers generally, diarrhoea, catarrhal\naffections and bronchitis, rheumatism and pneumonia. These forms of\nsickness lead, all the rest follow. There are twice as many sick as there\nare wounded. The deaths range from six to ten per cent of those under\ntreatment.\n\nI must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal, manliness, and\nprofessional spirit and capacity generally prevailing among the surgeons,\nmany of them young men, in the hospitals and the army. I will not say much\nabout the exceptions, for they are few (but I have met some of those few,\nand very foolish and airish they were). I never ceased to find the best\nyoung men, and the hardest and most disinterested workers, among these\nsurgeons, in the hospitals. They are full of genius, too. I have seen many\nhundreds of them, and this is my testimony.\n\nDuring my two years in the hospitals and upon the field, I have made over\nsix hundred visits, and have been, as I estimate, among from eighty\nthousand to one hundred thousand of the wounded and sick, as sustainer of\nspirit and body in some slight degree, in their time of need. These visits\nvaried from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear or critical\ncases I watched all night. Sometimes I took up my quarters in the\nhospital, and slept or watched there several nights in succession. I may\nadd that I am now just resuming my occupation in the hospitals and camps\nfor the winter of 1864-5, and probably to continue the seasons ensuing.\n\nTo many of the wounded and sick, especially the youngsters, there is\nsomething in personal love, caresses, and the magnetic flood of sympathy\nand friendship, that does, in its way, more good than all the medicine in\nthe world. I have spoken of my regular gifts of delicacies, money,\ntobacco, special articles of food, knick-knacks, etc., etc. But I\nsteadily found more and more that I could help, and turn the balance in\nfavor of cure, by the means here alluded to, in a curiously large\nproportion of cases. The American soldier is full of affection and the\nyearning for affection. And it comes wonderfully grateful to him to have\nthis yearning gratified when he is laid up with painful wounds or illness,\nfar away from home, among strangers. Many will think this merely\nsentimentalism, but I know it is the most solid of facts. I believe that\neven the moving around among the men, or through the ward, of a hearty,\nhealthy, clean, strong, generous-souled person, man or woman, full of\nhumanity and love, sending out invisible, constant currents thereof, does\nimmense good to the sick and wounded.\n\nTo those who might be interested in knowing it, I must add, in conclusion,\nthat I have tried to do justice to all the suffering that fell in my way.\nWhile I have been with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from the New\nEngland States, and from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and from\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, and the Western States, I have\nbeen with more or less from all the States North and South, without\nexception. I have been with many from the border States, especially from\nMaryland and Virginia, and found far more Union Southerners than is\nsupposed. I have been with many Rebel officers and men among our wounded,\nand given them always what I had, and tried to cheer them the same as\nany. I have been among the army teamsters considerably, and indeed always\nfind myself drawn to them. Among the black soldiers, wounded or sick, and\nin the contraband camps, I also took my way whenever in their\nneighborhood, and I did what I could for them.\n\nW. W.\n\n_From the New York_ Times, _December 11, 1864_.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: LOUISA (VAN VELSOR) WHITMAN\n\nFrom a Daguerreotype taken about 1855\n\nTHE HELIOTYPE PRINTING CO. BOSTON]\n\n\n\n\nLETTERS OF 1862-3\n\n\nI\n\n_Washington, Monday forenoon, Dec. 29, 1862._ DEAR, DEAR MOTHER--Friday\nthe 19th inst. I succeeded in reaching the camp of the 51st New York, and\nfound George[1] alive and well. In order to make sure that you would get\nthe good news, I sent back by messenger to Washington a telegraphic\ndispatch (I dare say you did not get it for some time) as well as a\nletter--and the same to Hannah[2] at Burlington. I have staid in camp with\nGeorge ever since, till yesterday, when I came back to Washington, about\nthe 24th. George got Jeff's[3] letter of the 20th. Mother, how much you\nmust have suffered, all that week, till George's letter came--and all the\nrest must too. As to me, I know I put in about three days of the greatest\nsuffering I ever experienced in my life. I wrote to Jeff how I had my\npocket picked in a jam and hurry, changing cars, at Philadelphia--so that\nI landed here without a dime. The next two days I spent hunting through\nthe hospitals, walking day and night, unable to ride, trying to get\ninformation--trying to get access to big people, etc.--I could not get\nthe least clue to anything. Odell would not see me at all. But Thursday\nafternoon, I lit on a way to get down on the Government boat that runs to\nAquia creek, and so by railroad to the neighborhood of Falmouth, opposite\nFredericksburg--so by degrees I worked my way to Ferrero's[4] brigade,\nwhich I found Friday afternoon without much trouble after I got in camp.\nWhen I found dear brother George, and found that he was alive and well, O\nyou may imagine how trifling all my little cares and difficulties\nseemed--they vanished into nothing. And now that I have lived for eight or\nnine days amid such scenes as the camps furnish, and had a practical part\nin it all, and realize the way that hundreds of thousands of good men are\nnow living, and have had to live for a year or more, not only without any\nof the comforts, but with death and sickness and hard marching and hard\nfighting (and no success at that) for their continual experience--really\nnothing we call trouble seems worth talking about. One of the first things\nthat met my eyes in camp was a heap of feet, arms, legs, etc., under a\ntree in front of a hospital, the Lacy house.\n\nGeorge is very well in health, has a good appetite--I think he is at times\nmore wearied out and homesick than he shows, but stands it upon the whole\nvery well. Every one of the soldiers, to a man, wants to get home.\n\nI suppose Jeff got quite a long letter I wrote, from camp, about a week\nago. I told you that George had been promoted to captain--his commission\narrived while I was there. When you write, address, Capt. George W.\nWhitman, Co. K., 51st New York Volunteers, Ferrero's brigade, near\nFalmouth, Va. Jeff must write oftener, and put in a few lines from mother,\neven if it is only two lines--then in the next letter a few lines from\nMat, and so on. You have no idea how letters from home cheer one up in\ncamp, and dissipate homesickness.\n\nWhile I was there George still lived in Capt. Francis's tent--there were\nfive of us altogether, to eat, sleep, write, etc., in a space twelve feet\nsquare, but we got along very well--the weather all along was very\nfine--and would have got along to perfection, but Capt. Francis is not a\nman I could like much--I had very little to say to him. George is about\nbuilding a place, half hut and half tent, for himself, (he is probably\nabout it this very day,) and then he will be better off, I think. Every\ncaptain has a tent, in which he lives, transacts company business, etc.,\nhas a cook, (or a man of all work,) and in the same tent mess and sleep\nhis lieutenants, and perhaps the first sergeant. They have a kind of\nfire-place--and the cook's fire is outside on the open ground. George had\nvery good times while Francis was away--the cook, a young disabled\nsoldier, Tom, is an excellent fellow and a first-rate cook, and the second\nlieutenant, Pooley, is a tip-top young Pennsylvanian. Tom thinks all the\nworld of George; when he heard he was wounded, on the day of the battle,\nhe left everything, got across the river, and went hunting for George\nthrough the field, through thick and thin. I wrote to Jeff that George was\nwounded by a shell, a gash in the cheek--you could stick a splint through\ninto the mouth, but it has healed up without difficulty already.\nEverything is uncertain about the army, whether it moves or stays where it\nis. There are no furloughs granted at present. I will stay here for the\npresent, at any rate long enough to see if I can get any employment at\nanything, and shall write what luck I have. Of course I am unsettled at\npresent. Dear mother; my love.\n\n    WALT.\n\nIf Jeff or any writes, address me, care of Major Hapgood, paymaster, U. S.\nA. Army, Washington, D. C. I send my love to dear sister Mat,[5] and\nlittle Sis[6]--and to Andrew[7] and all my brothers. O Mat, how lucky it\nwas you did not come--together, we could never have got down to see\nGeorge.\n\n\nII\n\n_Washington, Friday morning, Jan. 2, 1863._ DEAR SISTER[8]--You have heard\nof my fortunes and misfortunes of course, (through my letters to mother\nand Jeff,) since I left home that Tuesday afternoon. But I thought I would\nwrite a few lines to you, as it is a comfort to write home, even if I have\nnothing particular to say. Well, dear sister, I hope you are well and\nhearty, and that little Sis[9] keeps as well as she always had, when I\nleft home so far. Dear little plague, how I would like to have her with\nme, for one day; I can fancy I see her, and hear her talk. Jeff must have\ngot a note from me about a letter I have written to the _Eagle_--you may\nbe sure you will get letters enough from me, for I have little else to do\nat present. Since I laid my eyes on dear brother George, and saw him alive\nand well--and since I have spent a week in camp, down there opposite\nFredericksburg, and seen what well men, and sick men, and mangled men\nendure--it seems to me I can be satisfied and happy henceforward if I can\nget one meal a day, and know that mother and all are in good health, and\nespecially be with you again, and have some little steady paying\noccupation in N. Y. or Brooklyn.\n\nI am writing this in the office of Major Hapgood, way up in the top of a\nbig high house, corner of 15th and F street; there is a splendid view,\naway down south of the Potomac river, and across to the Georgetown side,\nand the grounds and houses of Washington spread out beneath my high point\nof view. The weather is perfect--I have had that in my favor ever since\nleaving home--yesterday and to-day it is bright, and plenty warm enough.\nThe poor soldiers are continually coming in from the hospitals, etc., to\nget their pay--some of them waiting for it to go home. They climb up here,\nquite exhausted, and then find it is no good, for there is no money to pay\nthem; there are two or three paymasters' desks in this room, and the\nscenes of disappointment are quite affecting. Here they wait in\nWashington, perhaps week after week, wretched and heart-sick--this is the\ngreatest place of delays and puttings off, and no finding the clue to\nanything. This building is the paymaster-general's quarters, and the\ncrowds on the walk and corner of poor, sick, pale, tattered soldiers are\nawful--many of them day after day disappointed and tired out. Well, Mat, I\nwill suspend my letter for the present, and go through the city--I have a\ncouple of poor fellows in the hospital to visit also.\n\n    WALT.\n\n_Saturday evening, Jan. 3_ [1863.] I write this in the place where I have\nmy lodging-room, 394 L street, 4th door above 14th street. A friend of\nmine, William D. O'Connor,[10] has two apartments on the 3rd floor, very\nordinarily furnished, for which he pays the _extra_ordinary price of $25 a\nmonth. I have a werry little bedroom on the 2nd floor. Mr. and Mrs.\nO'Connor and their little girl have all gone out \"down town\" for an hour\nor two, to make some Saturday evening purchases, and I am left in\npossession of the premises--so I sit by the fire, and scribble more of my\nletter. I have not heard anything from dear brother George since I left\nthe camp last Sunday morning, 28th Dec. I wrote to him on Tuesday last. I\nwish to get to him the two blue woolen shirts Jeff sent, as they would\ncome very acceptable to him--and will try to do it yet. I think of sending\nthem by mail, if the postage is not more than $1.\n\nYesterday I went out to the Campbell hospital to see a couple of Brooklyn\nboys, of the 51st. They knew I was in Washington, and sent me a note, to\ncome and see them. O my dear sister, how your heart would ache to go\nthrough the rows of wounded young men, as I did--and stopt to speak a\ncomforting word to them. There were about 100 in one long room, just a\nlong shed neatly whitewashed inside. One young man was very much\nprostrated, and groaning with pain. I stopt and tried to comfort him. He\nwas very sick. I found he had not had any medical attention since he was\nbrought there; among so many he had been overlooked; so I sent for the\ndoctor, and he made an examination of him. The doctor behaved very\nwell--seemed to be anxious to do right--said that the young man would\nrecover; he had been brought pretty low with diarrhoea, and now had\nbronchitis, but not so serious as to be dangerous. I talked to him some\ntime--he seemed to have entirely given up, and lost heart--he had not a\ncent of money--not a friend or acquaintance. I wrote a letter from him to\nhis sister--his name is John A. Holmes, Campello, Plymouth county, Mass. I\ngave him a little change I had--he said he would like to buy a drink of\nmilk when the woman came through with milk. Trifling as this was, he was\novercome and began to cry. Then there were many, many others. I mention\nthe one, as a specimen. My Brooklyn boys were John Lowery, shot at\nFredericksburg, and lost his left forearm, and Amos H. Vliet--Jeff knows\nthe latter--he has his feet frozen, and is doing well. The 100 are in a\nward, (6), and there are, I should think, eight or ten or twelve such\nwards in the Campbell hospital--indeed a real village. Then there are 38\nmore hospitals here in Washington, some of them much larger.\n\n_Sunday forenoon, Jan. 4, 1863._ Mat, I hope and trust dear mother and all\nare well, and everything goes on good home. The envelope I send, Jeff or\nany of you can keep for direction, or use it when wanted to write to me.\nAs near as I can tell, the army at Falmouth remains the same. Dear sister,\ngood-bye.\n\n    WALT.\n\nI send my love to Andrew and Jesse and Eddy and all. What distressing news\nthis is of the loss of the Monitor.[11]\n\n\nIII\n\n_Washington, Friday noon, February 6, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Jeff must\nhave got a letter from me yesterday, containing George's last letter. The\nnews of your sickness and the strange silence of Han made me feel somewhat\ngloomy. I wrote to George yesterday, conveying the news--and to-day I have\nsent him another letter, with much more comforting news, for I was so glad\nto hear from Han (her letter enclosed in Jeff's received this morning)\nthat I wrote him right away, and sent Han's letter.\n\nMother, I am quite in hopes George will get a furlough--may-be my\nexpectations are unfounded, but I almost count on it. I am so glad this\nmorning to hear you are no worse, but changed for the better--and dear\nsister Mat too, and Sissy, I am so glad to think they are recovering.\nJeff's enclosure of $10 through Mr. Lane, from the young engineers for the\nsoldiers in hospitals, the most needy cases, came safe of course--I shall\nacknowledge it to Mr. Lane to-morrow. Mother, I have written so much about\nhospitals that I will not write any in this letter.\n\nWe have had bad weather enough here lately to most make up for the\ndelightful weather we had for five weeks after I came from home.\n\nMother, I do hope you will be careful, and not get any relapse--and hope\nyou will go on improving. Do you then think of getting new apartments,\nafter the 1st of May? I suppose Jeff has settled about the lot--it seems\nto me first rate as an investment--the kind of house to build is quite a\nconsideration (if any house). I should build a _regular Irish shanty_\nmyself--two rooms, and an end shed. I think that's luxury enough, since I\nhave been down in the army.\n\nWell, mother, I believe I will not fill out the sheet this time, as I want\nto go down without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter and this\none. Good-bye, dear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nIV\n\n_Washington, Monday morning, Feb. 9, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I write to\nenclose you a letter I have just received from George. His corps (Ninth\nArmy) and perhaps one other are to move either to Fort Monroe, or\nsomewhere down there--some say Suffolk. I am in hopes that when they get\nthere, George will still have a sight for a furlough. I have written him I\nshould think four letters since the 27th Jan. (and have sent him Han's\nletter to you in one). I hope he has got most of them before this. I am\nafraid the $3 change I sent him is gone. He will write to you as soon as\nhe gets settled wherever they go to. I don't know as it makes any\ndifference in respect to danger, or fighting, from this move. One reason\nthey have to move from the Rappahannock, up there, is that wood is all\ngone for miles, forage is scarce to get, and I don't know as there is any\nneed of their staying there, for any purpose. In some haste, dearest\nmother, as I am off to visit for an hour or so, one of my hospitals. Your\naffectionate son,\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nV\n\n_Office Major Hapgood, cor. 15th & F sts, Washington, Feb. 13, 1863._ DEAR\nBROTHER[12]--Nothing new; still I thought I would write you a line this\nmorning. The $4, namely $2 from Theo A. Drake and $2 from John D. Martin,\nenclosed in your letter of the 10th, came safe. They too will please\naccept the grateful thanks of several poor fellows, in hospital here.\n\nThe letter of introduction to Mr. Webster, chief clerk, State department,\nwill be very acceptable. If convenient, I should like Mr. Lane to send it\non immediately. I do not so much look for an appointment from Mr. Seward\nas his backing me from the State of New York. I have seen Preston King\nthis morning for the second time (it is very amusing to hunt for an\noffice--so the thing seems to me just now, even if one don't get it). I\nhave seen Charles Sumner three times--he says ev'ry thing here moves as\npart of a great machine, and that I must consign myself to the fate of the\nrest--still [in] an interview I had with him yesterday he talked and acted\nas though he had life in him, and would exert himself to any reasonable\nextent for me to get something. Meantime I make about enough to pay my\nexpenses by hacking on the press here, and copying in the paymasters'\noffices, a couple of hours a day. One thing is favorable here, namely, pay\nfor whatever one does is at a high rate. I have not yet presented my\nletters to either Seward or Chase--I thought I would get my forces all in\na body, and make one concentrated dash, if possible with the personal\nintroduction and presence of some big bug. I like fat old Preston King\nvery much--he is fat as a hogshead, with great hanging chops. The first\nthing he said to me the other day in the parlor chambers of the Senate,\nwhen I sent in for him and he came out, was, \"Why, how can I do this\nthing, or any thing for you--how do I know but you are a Secessionist? You\nlook for all the world like an old Southern planter--a regular Carolina\nor Virginia planter.\" I treated him with just as much hauteur as he did\nme with bluntness--this was the first time--it afterward proved that\nCharles Sumner had not prepared the way for me, as I supposed, or rather\nnot so strongly as I supposed, and Mr. King had even forgotten it--so I\nwas an entire stranger. But the same day C. S. talked further with Mr.\nKing in the Senate, and the second interview I had with the latter (this\nforenoon) he has given me a sort of general letter, endorsing me from New\nYork--one envelope is addressed to Secretary Chase, and another to Gen.\nMeigs, head Quartermaster's dept. Meantime, I am getting better and better\nacquainted with office-hunting wisdom and Washington peculiarities\ngenerally. I spent several hours in the Capitol the other day. The\nincredible gorgeousness of some of the rooms, (interior decorations,\netc.)--rooms used perhaps but for merely three or four committee meetings\nin the course of the whole year--is beyond one's flightiest dreams. Costly\nfrescoes of the style of Taylor's saloon in Broadway, only really the best\nand choicest of their sort, done by imported French and Italian artists,\nare the prevailing sorts. (Imagine the work you see on the fine china\nvases in Tiffany's, the paintings of Cupids and goddesses, etc., spread\nrecklessly over the arched ceiling and broad panels of a big room--the\nwhole floor underneath paved with tesselated pavement, which is a sort of\ncross between marble and china, with little figures, drab, blue, cream\ncolor, etc.) These things, with heavy elaborately wrought balustrades,\ncolumns, and steps--all of the most beautiful marbles I ever saw, some\nwhite as milk, other of all colors, green, spotted, lined, or of our old\nchocolate color--all these marbles used as freely as if they were common\nblue flags--with rich door-frames and window-casings of bronze and\ngold--heavy chandeliers and mantles, and clocks in every room--and indeed\nby far the richest and gayest, and most un-American and inappropriate\nornamenting and finest interior workmanship I ever conceived possible,\nspread in profusion through scores, hundreds, (and almost thousands) of\nrooms--such are what I find, or rather would find to interest me, if I\ndevoted time to it. But a few of the rooms are enough for me--the style is\nwithout grandeur, and without simplicity. These days, the state our\ncountry is in, and especially filled as I am from top to toe of late with\nscenes and thoughts of the hospitals, (America seems to me now, though\nonly in her youth, but brought already here, feeble, bandaged, and bloody\nin hospital)--these days I say, Jeff, all the poppy-show goddesses, and\nall the pretty blue and gold in which the interior Capitol is got up, seem\nto me out of place beyond anything I could tell--and I get away from it as\nquick as I can when that kind of thought comes over me. I suppose it is to\nbe described throughout--those interiors--as all of them got up in the\nFrench style--well, enough for a New York.\n\n\nVI\n\n_Washington, March 31, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have not heard from\nGeorge, except a note he wrote me a couple of days after he got back from\nhis furlough. I think it likely the regiment has gone with its corps to\nthe West, the Kentucky or Tennessee region--Burnside at last accounts was\nin Cincinnati. Well, it will be a change for George, if he is out there. I\nsent a long letter to Han last Saturday--enclosed George's note to me.\nMother, when you or Jeff writes again, tell me if my papers and MSS. are\nall right; I should be very sorry indeed if they got scattered, or used up\nor anything--especially the copy of \"Leaves of Grass\" covered in blue\npaper,[13] and the little MS. book \"Drum-Taps,\" and the MS. tied up in the\nsquare, spotted (stone-paper) loose covers--I want them all carefully\nkept.\n\nMother, it is quite a snow-storm here this morning--the ground is an inch\nand a half deep with snow--and it is snowing and drizzling--but I feel\nvery independent in my stout army-boots; I go anywhere. I _have_ felt\nquite well of my deafness and cold in my head for four days or so, but it\nis back again bad as ever this morning.\n\nDear mother, I wrote the above in my room--I have now come down to Major\nHapgood's office. I do not find anything from home, and no particular news\nin the paper this morning--no news about the Ninth Army Corps, or where\nthey are. I find a good letter from one of my New York boys, (Fifth\navenue) a young fellow named Hugo Fritsch, son of the Austrian\nConsul-General--he writes me a long, first-rate letter this morning. He\ntoo speaks about the Opera--like Jeff he goes there a good deal--says that\nMedori, the soprano, as Norma made the greatest success ever seen--says\nthat the whole company there now, the singers, are very fine. All this I\nwrite for Jeff and Mat--I hope they will go once in a while when it is\nconvenient.\n\nIt is a most disagreeable day here, mother, walking poshy and a rain and\ndrizzle.\n\nThere is nothing new with me, no particular sight for an office that I can\ncount on. But I can make enough with the papers, for the present\nnecessities. I hear that the paymaster, Major Yard, that pays the 51st,\nhas gone on West, I suppose to Cincinnati, or wherever the brigade has\ngone--of course to pay up--he pays up to 1st of March--all the Army is\ngoing to be paid up to 1st March everywhere.\n\nMother, I hope you are well and hearty as usual. I am so glad you are none\nof you going to move. I would like to have the pleasure of Miss\nMannahatta Whitman's company, the first fine forenoon, if it were\npossible; I think we might have first-rate times, for one day at any rate.\nI hope she will not forget her Uncle Walt. I received a note from\nProbasco, requesting me not to put his name in my next letter. I\nappreciate his motive, and wish to please him always--but in this matter I\nshall do what I think appropriate. Mother, I see some very interesting\npersons here--a young master's mate, who was on the Hatteras, when\nsurprised and broadsided by the Alabama, Capt Semmes--he gave me a very\ngood acc't of it all--then Capt. Mullen, U. S. Army, (engineer) who has\nbeen six years out in the Rocky mts. making a Gov't road 650 miles from\nFt. Benton to Walla Walla--very, very interesting to know such men\nintimately, and talk freely with them. Dearest mother, I shall have great\nyarns to spin, when I come home. I am not a bit homesick, yet I should\nlike to see you and Mat very, very much--one thinks of the women when he\nis away.\n\n    WALT.\n\nShall send the shirts in a day or two.\n\n\nVII\n\n_Washington, Wednesday forenoon, April 15, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Jeff's\nletter of the 11th, acknowledging the books, also the one about five days\nprevious, containing the $10 from Van Anden, came safe. Jeff's letters\nare always first rate and welcome--the good long one with so much about\nhome, and containing Han's and George's, was especially so. It is a great\npleasure, though sometimes a melancholy one, to hear from Han, under her\nown hand. I have writ to George--I wrote last Friday. I directed the\nletter to \"Lexington or elsewhere, Kentucky\"--as I saw in a letter in a\nCincinnati paper that Gen. Ferrero was appointed provost marshal at\nLexington. The 51st is down there somewhere, and I guess it is about as\nwell off there as anywhere. There is much said about their closing up the\nregimental companies--that is, where there are ten companies of 40 men\neach, closing them up to five companies, of 80 men each. It is said the\nGovernment purposes something of this kind. It will throw a good many\ncaptains and lieutenants out. I suppose you know that Le Gendre is now\ncolonel of the 51st--it's a pity if we haven't Americans enough to put\nover our old war regiments. (I think less and less of foreigners, in this\nwar. What I see, especially in the hospitals, convinces me that there is\nno other stock, for emergencies, but native American--no other name by\nwhich we can be saved.)\n\nMother, I feel quite bad about Andrew--I am so in hopes to hear that he\nhas recovered--I think about him every day. He must not get fretting and\ndisheartened--that is really the worst feature of any sickness. Diseases\nof the throat and bronchia are the result always of bad state of the\nstomach, blood, etc. (they never come from the throat itself). The throat\nand the bronchia are lined, like the stomach and other interior organs,\nwith a fine lining like silk or crape, and when all this gets ulcerated or\ninflamed or what-not (it is Dr. Sammis's _mucous membrane_, you know) it\nis bad, and most distressing. Medicine is really of no great account,\nexcept just to pacify a person. This lining I speak of is full of little\nblood vessels, and the way to make a _real cure_ is by gentle and steady\nmeans to recuperate the whole system; this will tell upon the blood, upon\nthe blood vessels, and so finally and effectually upon all this coating I\nspeak of that lines the throat, etc. But as it is a long time before this\nvital lining membrane (_very important_) is injured, so it is a long time\nbefore it can be made all healthy and right again; but Andrew is young and\nstrong enough and [has a] good constitution for basis--and of course by\nregular diet, care, (and nary whiskey under any circumstances) I am sure\nhe would not only get over that trouble, but be as well and strong as he\never was in his life. Mother, you tell him I sent him my love, and\nNancy[14] the same, and the dear little boys the same--the next time you\nor Mat goes down there you take this and show him.\n\nMat, I am quite glad to hear that you are not hurried and fretted with\nwork from New York this spring--I am sure I should think Sis and\nhousekeeping, etc., would be enough to attend to. I was real amused with\nSis's remarks, and all that was in the letter about her. You must none of\nyou notice her smartness, nor criticisms, before her, nor encourage her to\nspread herself nor be critical, as it is not good to encourage a child to\nbe too sharp--and I hope Sissy is going to be a splendid specimen of good\nanimal health. For the few years to come I should think more of that than\nanything--that is the foundation of all (righteousness included); as to\nher mental vivacity and growth, they are plenty enough of themselves, and\nwill get along quite fast enough of themselves, plenty fast enough--don't\nstimulate them at all. Dear little creature, how I should like to see her\nthis minute. Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music anyways strong\nor frequent on any account--two lessons a week, of ten minutes each, is\nenough--but then I dare say Jeff will think of all these things, just the\nsame as I am saying. Jeff writes he wonders if I am as well and hearty,\nand I suppose he means as much of a beauty as ever, whether I look the\nsame. Well, not only as much but more so--I believe I weigh about 200, and\nas to my face, (so scarlet,) and my beard and neck, they are terrible to\nbehold. I fancy the reason I am able to do some good in the hospitals\namong the poor languishing and wounded boys, is, that I am so large and\nwell--indeed like a great wild buffalo, with much hair. Many of the\nsoldiers are from the West, and far North, and they take to a man that has\nnot the bleached shiny and shaved cut of the cities and the East. I\nspent three to four hours yesterday in Armory hospital. One of my\nparticular boys there was dying--pneumonia--he wanted me to stop with him\nawhile; he could not articulate--but the look of his eyes, and the holding\non of his hand was deeply affecting. His case is a relapse--eight days ago\nhe had recovered, was up, was perhaps a little careless--at any rate took\ncold, was taken down again and has sank rapidly. He has no friends or\nrelatives here. Yesterday he labored and panted so for breath, it was\nterrible. He is a young man from New England, from the country. I expected\nto see his cot vacated this afternoon or evening, as I shall go down then.\nMother, if you or Mat was here a couple of days, you would cry your eyes\nout. I find I have to restrain myself and keep my composure--I succeed\npretty well. Good-bye, dearest mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\nJeff, Capt. Muller remains here yet for some time. He is bringing out his\nreport. I shall try to send you a copy. Give my best respects to Dr.\nRuggles.\n\nMother, my last letter home was a week ago to-day--we are having a dark\nrainy day here--it is now half-past 3. I have been in my room all day so\nfar--shall have dinner in half an hour, and then down to Armory.\n\n\nVIII\n\n_Washington, April 28, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--A letter from Jeff came this\nmorning. Mother, I was sorry to hear you had a return of your\nrheumatism--I do hope you will favor yourself more, it depends so much on\nthat--and rheumatism is so obstinate, when it gets hold of one. Mother,\nyou received a letter from me sent last Wednesday, 22nd, of course, with a\nsmall quantity of shinplasters. Next time you or Jeff writes, I wish you\nwould tell me whether the letters come pretty regularly, the next morning\nafter I write them--this now ought to reach you Wednesday forenoon, April\n29th. Mother, did a Mr. Howell call on you? He was here last week to see\nabout his boy, died a long while ago in hospital in Yorktown. He works in\nthe Navy Yard--knows Andrew. You will see about him (the boy) in a letter\nI sent yesterday to the _Eagle_--it ought to appear to-day or to-morrow.\n\nJeff, I wish you would take 10c I send in this letter and get me ten\ncopies of the _Eagle_ with it in--put in five more of my pictures (the big\nones in last edition \"Leaves\"), and a couple of the photographs carte\nvisites (the smaller ones), and send me to the same direction as before;\nit came very well. I will send an _Eagle_ to Han and George. The stamps\nand 10c are for Jeff for the papers and postage.\n\nI have written to Han, and sent her George's last two letters from\nKentucky; one I got last week from Mount Sterling. I write to George and\nsend him papers. Sam Beatty is here in Washington again. I saw him, and he\nsaid he would write to George. Mother, I have not got any new clothes yet,\nbut shall very soon I hope. People are more rough and free and easy drest\nthan your way. Then it is dusty or muddy most of the time here. Mother\ndear, I hope you have comfortable times--at least as comfortable as the\nlaw allows. I am so glad you are not going to have the trouble of moving\nthis 1st of May. How are the Browns? Tell Will I should like to see him\nfirst rate--if he was here attached to the suite of some big officer, or\nsomething of that kind, he would have a good time and do well. I see lots\nof young fellows not half as capable and trustworthy as he, coming and\ngoing in Washington, in such positions. The big generals and head men all\nthrough the armies, and provosts etc., like to have a squad of such smart,\nnimble young men around them. Give my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Brown.\n\nTell Jeff I am going to write to Mr. Lane either to-day or to-morrow. Jeff\nasks me if I go to hospitals as much as ever. If my letters home don't\nshow it, you don't get 'em. I feel sorry sometimes after I have sent them,\nI have said so much about hospitals, and so mournful. O mother, the young\nman in Armory-square, Dennis Barrett, in the 169th N. Y., I mentioned\nbefore, is probably going to get up after all; he is like one saved from\nthe grave. Saturday last I saw him and talked with him and gave him\nsomething to eat, and he was much better--it is the most unexpected\nrecovery I have yet seen. Mother, I see Jeff says in the letter you don't\nhear from me very often--I will write oftener, especially to Jeff. Dear\nbrother, I hope you are getting along good, and in good spirits; you must\nnot mind the failure of the sewer bills, etc. It don't seem to me it makes\nso much difference about worldly successes (beyond just enough to eat and\ndrink and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the last four\nmonths of my life especially, and that merely to live, and have one fair\nmeal a day, is enough--but then you have a family, and that makes a\ndifference.\n\nMatty, I send you my best love, dear sister--how I wish I could be with\nyou one or two good days. Mat, do you remember the good time we had that\nawful stormy night we went to the Opera, New York, and had the front seat,\nand heard the handsome-mouthed Guerrabella? and had the good oyster supper\nat Fulton market--(\"pewter them ales.\") O Mat, I hope and trust we shall\nhave such times again.\n\nTell Andrew he must remember what I wrote about the throat, etc. I am sure\nhe will get all right before long, and recover his voice. Give him my\nlove--and tell Mannahatta her Uncle Walt is living now among the sick\nsoldiers. Jeff, look out for the _Eagles_, and send the portraits.\nDearest mother, I must bid you and all for the present good-bye.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nIX\n\n_Washington, Tuesday, May 5, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Your letter came safe,\nand was very welcome, and always will be. Mother, I am sorry about your\nrheumatism--if it still continues I think it would be well for me to write\na line to Mrs. Piercy, and get Jeff to stop with it, so that you could\ntake the baths again, as I am sure they are very beneficial. Dear mother,\nyou write me, or Jeff must in the next letter, how you are getting along,\nwhether it is any better or worse--I want to know. Mother, about George's\nfund in the bank; I hope by all means you can scratch along so as to leave\n$250 there--I am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch,\neven if it is the meanest kind, off somewhere that you can call your own,\nand that would do for Ed etc.--it might be a real dependence, and\ncomfort--and may-be for George as much as any one. I mean to come home one\nof these days, and get the acre or half acre somewhere out in some\nby-place on Long Island, and build it--you see if I don't. About Hannah,\ndear mother, I hardly know what advice to give you--from what I know at\npresent I can't tell what course to pursue. I want Han to come home, from\nthe bottom of my heart. Then there are other thoughts and considerations\nthat come up. Dear mother, I cannot advise, but shall acquiesce in\nanything that is settled upon, and try to help.\n\nThe condition of things here in the hospitals is getting pretty bad--the\nwounded from the battles around Fredericksburg are coming up in large\nnumbers. It is very sad to see them. I have written to Mr. Lane, asking\nhim to get his friends to forward me what they think proper--but somehow I\nfeel delicate about sending such requests, after all.\n\nI have almost made up my mind to do what I can personally, and not seek\nassistance from others.\n\nDear mother, I have not received any letter from George. I write to him\nand send papers to Winchester. Mother, while I have been writing this a\nvery large number of Southern prisoners, I should think 1,000 at least,\nhas past up Pennsylvania avenue, under a strong guard. I went out in the\nstreet, close to them. Poor fellows, many of them mere lads--it brought\nthe tears; they seemed our flesh and blood too, some wounded, all\nmiserable in clothing, all in dirt and tatters--many of them fine young\nmen. Mother, I cannot tell you how I feel to see those prisoners marched.\n\n\nX\n\n_Washington, Wednesday forenoon, May 13, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I am late\nwith my letter this week--my poor, poor boys occupy my time very much--I\ngo every day, and sometimes nights. I believe I mentioned a young man in\nWard F, Armory-square, with a bad wound in the leg, very agonizing--had to\nhave it propt up, and an attendant all the while dripping water on night\nand day. I was in hopes at one time he would get through with it, but a\nfew days ago he took a sudden bad turn and died about 3 o'clock the same\nafternoon--it was horrible. He was of good family--handsome, intelligent\nman, about 26, married; his name was John Elliot, of Cumberland Valley,\nBedford co., Penn.--belonged to 2nd Pennsylvania Cavalry. I felt very bad\nabout it. I have wrote to his father--have not received any answer yet; no\nfriend nor any of his folks was here, and have not been here nor\nsent--probably don't know of it at all. The surgeons put off amputating\nthe leg, he was so exhausted, but at last it was imperatively necessary to\namputate. Mother, I am shocked to tell you that he never came alive off\nthe amputating table--he died under the operation--it was what I had\ndreaded and anticipated. Poor young man, he suffered much, very, _very_\nmuch, for many days, and bore it so patiently--so that it was a release to\nhim. Mother, such things are awful--not a soul here he knew or cared\nabout, except me--yet the surgeons and nurses were good to him. I think\nall was done for him that could be--there was no help but take off the\nleg; he was under chloroform--they tried their best to bring him\nto--three long hours were spent, a strong smelling bottle held under his\nnostrils, with other means, three hours. Mother, how contemptible all the\nusual little worldly prides and vanities, and striving after appearances,\nseems in the midst of such scenes as these--such tragedies of soul and\nbody. To see such things and not be able to help them is awful--I feel\nalmost ashamed of being so well and whole.\n\nDear mother, I have not heard from George himself; but I got a letter from\nFred McReady, a young Brooklyn man in 51st--he is intimate with George,\nsaid he was well and hearty. I got the letter about five days ago. I wrote\nto George four days since, directed to Winchester, Kentucky. I got a\nletter from a friend in Nashville, Tenn., yesterday--he told me the 9th\nArmy Corps was ordered to move to Murfreesboro, Tenn. I don't know whether\nthis is so or not. I send papers to George almost every day. So far I\nthink it was fortunate the 51st was moved West, and I hope it will\ncontinue so. Mother, it is all a lottery, this war; no one knows what will\ncome up next.\n\nMother, I received Jeff's letter of May 9th--it was welcome, as all Jeff's\nletters are, and all others from home. Jeff says you do not hear from me\nat home but seldom. Mother, I write once a week to you regular; but I will\nwrite soon to Jeff a good long letter--I have wanted to for some time, but\nhave been much occupied. Dear brother, I wish you to say to Probasco and\nall the other young men on the Works, I send them my love and best\nthanks--never anything came more acceptable than the little fund they\nforwarded me the last week through Mr. Lane. Our wounded from Hooker's\nbattles are worse wounded and more of them than any battle of the war, and\nindeed any, I may say, of modern times--besides, the weather has been very\nhot here, very bad for new wounds. Yet as Jeff writes so downhearted I\nmust tell him the Rebellion has lost worse and more than we have. The more\nI find out about it, the more I think they, the Confederates, have\nreceived an irreparable harm and loss in Virginia--I should not be\nsurprised to see them (either voluntarily or by force) leaving Virginia\nbefore many weeks; I don't see how on earth they can stay there. I think\nHooker is already reaching after them again--I myself do not give up\nHooker yet. Dear mother, I should like to hear from Han, poor Han. I send\nmy best love to sister Mat and all. Good-bye, dearest mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXI\n\n_Washington, Tuesday forenoon, May 19, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--... I sent\nGeorge a letter yesterday--have not got any letter myself from Georgy, but\nhave sent him quite a good many and papers. Mother, what a tramp the 51st\nhas had--they only need now to go to California, and they will finish the\njob complete. O mother, how welcome the shirts were--I was putting off and\nputting off, to get some new ones. I could not find any one to do them as\nI want them, and it would have cost such a price--and so my old ones had\ngot to be. When they came back from the wash I had to laugh; they were a\nlot of rags, held together with starch. I have a very nice old black aunty\nfor a washwoman, but she bears down pretty hard, I guess, when she irons\nthem, and they showed something like the poor old city of Fredericksburg\ndoes, since Burnside bombarded it. Well, mother, when the bundle came, I\nwas so glad--and the coats too, worn as they are, they come in very\nhandy--and the cake, dear mother, I am almost like the boy that put it\nunder his pillow and woke up in the night and eat some. I carried a good\nchunk to a young man wounded I think a good deal of, and it did him so\nmuch good--it is dry, but all the better, as he eat it with tea and it\nrelished. I eat a piece with him, and drinked some tea out of his cup, as\nI sat by the side of his cot. Mother, I have neglected, I think, what I\nought to have told you two or three weeks ago, that is that I have\ndiscarded my old clothes--somewhat because they were too thick, and more\nstill because they were worse gone in than any I have ever yet wore, I\nthink, in my life, especially the trowsers. Wearing my big boots had\ncaused the inside of the legs just above the knee to wear two beautiful\nround holes right through cloth and partly through the lining, producing\na novel effect, which was not necessary, as I produce a sufficient\nsensation without--then they were desperately faded. I have a nice plain\nsuit of a dark wine color; looks very well, and feels good--single\nbreasted sack coat with breast pockets, etc., and vest and pants same as\nwhat I always wear (pants pretty full), so upon the whole all looks\nunusually good for me. My hat is very good yet, boots ditto; have a new\nnecktie, nice shirts--you can imagine I cut quite a swell. I have not\ntrimmed my beard since I left home, but it is not grown much longer, only\nperhaps a little bushier. I keep about as stout as ever, and the past five\nor six days I have felt wonderful well, indeed never did I feel better.\nAbout ten or twelve days ago, we had a short spell of very warm weather\nhere, but for about six days now it has been delightful, just warm enough.\nI generally go to the hospitals from 12 to 4--and then again from 6 to 9;\nsome days I only go in the middle of the day or evening, not both--and\nthen when I feel somewhat opprest, I skip over a day, or make perhaps a\nlight call only, as I have several cautions from the doctors, who tell me\nthat one must beware of continuing too steady and long in the air and\ninfluences of the hospitals. I find the caution a wise one.\n\nMother, you or Jeff must write me what Andrew does about going to North\nCarolina. I should think it might have a beneficial effect upon his\nthroat. I wrote Jeff quite a long letter Sunday. Jeff must write to me\nwhenever he can, I like dearly to have them--and whenever you feel like it\nyou too, dear mother. Tell Sis her uncle Walt will come back one of these\ndays from the sick soldiers and take her out on Fort Greene again. Mother,\nI received a letter yesterday from John Elliot's father, in Bedford co.,\nPennsylvania (the young man I told you about, who died under the\noperation). It was very sad; it was the first he knew about it. I don't\nknow whether I told you of Dennis Barrett, pneumonia three weeks since,\nhad got well enough to be sent home. Dearest Mother, I hope you will take\nthings as easy as possible and try to keep a good heart. Matty, my dear\nsister, I have to inform you that I was treated to a splendid dish of\nice-cream Sunday night; I wished you was with me to have another. I send\nyou my love, dear sister. Mother, I hope by all means it will be possible\nto keep the money whole to get some ranch next spring, if not before; I\nmean to come home and build it. Good-bye for the present, dear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXII\n\n_Washington, Tuesday forenoon, May 26, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I got a long\nletter from George, dated near Lancaster, Kentucky, May 15th; he seems to\nbe well and in good spirits--says he gets some letters from me and papers\ntoo. At the time he wrote the 51st was doing provost duty at Lancaster,\nbut would not probably remain so very long--seem to be moving towards\nsoutheast Kentucky--had a good camp, and good times generally. Le Gendre\nis colonel--Gen. Ferrero has left the service--Col. Potter (now\nbrig.-gen.) is in Cincinnati--Capt. Sims, etc., are all well. George\ndescribes Kentucky as a very fine country--says the people are about half\nand half, Secesh and Union. This is the longest letter I have yet received\nfrom George. Did he write you one about the same time? Mother, I have not\nrec'd any word from home in over a week--the last letter I had from Mr.\nLane was about twelve days ago, sending me $10 for the soldiers (five from\nMr. Kirkwood and five from Mr. Conklin Brush). Mother dear, I should like\nto hear from Martha; I wish Jeff would write me about it. Has Andrew gone?\nand how is your wrist and arm, mother? We had some very hot weather\nhere--I don't know what I should have done without the thin grey coat you\nsent--you don't know how good it does, and looks too; I wore it three\ndays, and carried a fan and an umbrella (quite a Japanee)--most everybody\nhere carries an umbrella, on account of the sun. Yesterday and to-day\nhowever have been quite cool, east wind. Mother, the shirts were a real\ngodsend, they do first rate; I like the fancy marseilles collar and\nwrist-bands. Mother, how are you getting along--I suppose just the same as\never. I suppose Jess and Ed are just the same as ever. When you write,\nyou tell me all about everything, and the Browns, and the neighborhood\ngenerally. Mother, is George's trunk home and of no use there? I wish I\nhad it here, as I must have a trunk--but do not wish you to send until I\nsend you word. I suppose my letter never appeared in the _Eagle_; well, I\nshall send them no more, as I think likely they hate to put in anything\nwhich may celebrate me a little, even though it is just the thing they\nwant for their paper and readers. They altered the other letter on that\naccount, very meanly. I shall probably have letters in the N. Y. _Times_\nand perhaps other papers in about a week. Mother, I have been pretty\nactive in hospitals for the past two weeks, somewhere every day or night.\nI have written you so much about cases, etc., I will not write you any\nmore on that subject this time. O the sad, sad things I see--the noble\nyoung men with legs and arms taken off--the deaths--the sick weakness,\nsicker than death, that some endure, after amputations (there is a great\ndifference, some make little of it, others lie after it for days, just\nflickering alive, and O so deathly weak and sick). I go this afternoon to\nCampbell hospital, out a couple of miles.\n\nMother, I should like to have Jeff send me 20 of the large-sized portraits\nand as many of the standing figure; do them up flat. I think every day\nabout Martha. Mother, have you heard any further about Han? Good-bye for\nthe present, dearest mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXIII\n\n_Washington, Tuesday morning, June 9, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Jeff's letter\ncame yesterday and was very welcome, as I wanted to hear about you all. I\nwrote to George yesterday and sent Jeff's letter enclosed. It looks from\nsome accounts as though the 9th Army Corps might be going down into East\nTennessee (Cumberland Gap, or perhaps bound for Knoxville). It is an\nimportant region, and has many Southern Unionists. The staunchest Union\nman I have ever met is a young Southerner in the 2nd Tennessee (Union\nreg't)--he was ten months in Southern prisons; came up from Richmond\nparoled about ten weeks ago, and has been in hospital here sick until\nlately. He suffered everything but death--he is [the] one they hung up by\nthe heels, head downwards--and indeed worse than death, but stuck to his\nconvictions like a hero--John Barker, a real manly fellow; I saw much of\nhim and heard much of that country that can be relied on. He is now gone\nhome to his reg't.\n\nMother, I am feeling very well these days--my head that was stopt up so\nand hard of hearing seems to be all right; I only hope you have had\nsimilar good fortune with your rheumatism, and that it will continue so. I\nwish I could come in for a couple of days and see you; if I should succeed\nin getting a transportation ticket that would take me to New York and back\nI should be tempted to come home for two or three days, as I want some\nMSS. and books, and the trunk, etc.--but I will see. Mother, your letter\nweek before last was very good--whenever you feel like it you write me,\ndear mother, and tell me everything about the neighborhood and all the\nitems of our family.\n\nAnd sister Mat, how is she getting along--I believe I will have to write a\nletter especially to her and Sis one of these times.\n\nIt is awful dry weather here, no rain of any consequence for five or six\nweeks. We have strawberries good and plenty, 15 cents a quart, with the\nhulls on--I go down to market sometimes of a morning and buy two or three\nquarts, for the folks I take my meals with. Mother, do you know I have not\npaid, as you may say, a cent of board since I have been in Washington,\nthat is for meals--four or five times I have made a rush to leave the\nfolks and find a moderate-priced boarding-house, but every time they have\nmade such a time about it that I have kept on. It is Mr. and Mrs. O'Connor\n(he is the author of \"Harrington\"); he has a $1600 office in the Treasury,\nand she is a first-rate woman, a Massachusetts girl. They keep house in a\nmoderate way; they have one little girl (lost a fine boy about a year\nago); they have two rooms in the same house where I hire my rooms, and I\ntake breakfast (half-past 8) and dinner (half-past 4) with them, as they\nwill have it so. That's the way it has gone on now over five months, and\nas I say, they won't listen to my leaving--but I shall do so, I think. I\ncan never forget the kindness and real friendship, and it appears as\nthough they would continue just the same, if it were for all our lives.\nBut I have insisted on going to market (it is pleasant in the cool of the\nmorning) and getting the things at my own expense, two or three times a\nweek lately. I pay for the room I occupy now $7 a month--the landlord is a\nmixture of booby, miser, and hog; his name is G----; the landlady is a\ngood woman, Washington raised--they are quite rich; he is Irish of the\nworst kind--has had a good office for ten years until Lincoln came in.\nThey have bought another house, smaller, to live in, and are going to move\n(were to have moved 1st of June). They had an auction of the house we live\nin yesterday, but nobody came to buy, so it was ridiculous--we had a red\nflag out, and a nigger walked up and down ringing a big bell, which is the\nfashion here for auctions.\n\nWell, mother, the war still goes on, and everything as much in a fog as\never--and the battles as bloody, and the wounded and sick getting worse\nand plentier all the time. I see a letter in the _Tribune_ from Lexington,\nKy., June 5th, headed \"The 9th Army Corps departing for Vicksburg\"--but I\ncannot exactly make it out on reading the letter carefully--I don't see\nanything in the letter about the 9th Corps moving from Vicksburg; at any\nrate I think the 2nd division is more likely to be needed in Kentucky (or\nas I said, in Eastern Tennessee), as the Secesh are expected to make\ntrouble there. But one can hardly tell--the only thing is to resign\noneself to events as they occur; it is a sad and dreary time, for so many\nthousands of parents and relatives, not knowing what will occur next.\nMother, I told you, I think last week, that I had wrote to Han, and\nenclosed George's last letter to me--I wrote a week ago last Sunday--I\nwonder if she got the letter. About the pictures, I should like Jeff to\nsend them, as soon as convenient--might send 20 of the big head, 10 or 12\nof the standing figure, and 3 of the carte visite.\n\nI am writing this in Major Hapgood's office--it is bright and pleasant,\nonly the dust here in Washington is a great nuisance. Mother, your shirts\ndo first rate--I am wearing them; the one I have on to-day suits me better\nthan any I have ever yet had. I have not worn the thin coat the last week\nor so, as it has not been very hot lately. Mother, I think something of\ncommencing a series of lectures and reading, etc., through different\ncities of the North, to supply myself with funds for my hospital and\nsoldiers' visits, as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others.\nI need a pretty large supply of money, etc., to do the good I would like\nto, and the work grows upon me, and fascinates me--it is the most\naffecting thing you ever see, the lots of poor sick and wounded young men\nthat depend so much, in one word or another, upon my petting or soothing\nor feeding, sitting by them and feeding them their dinner or supper--some\nare quite helpless, some wounded in both arms--or giving some trifle (for\na novelty or a change, it isn't for the value of it), or stopping a little\nwhile with them. Nobody will do but me--so, mother, I feel as though I\nwould like to inaugurate a plan by which I could raise means on my own\nhook, and perhaps quite plenty too. Best love to you, dearest mother, and\nto sister Mat, and Jeff.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXIV\n\n_Washington, Monday morning, June 22, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--Jeff's letter\ncame informing me of the birth of the little girl,[15] and that Matty was\nfeeling pretty well, so far. I hope it will continue. Dear sister, I\nshould much like to come home and see you and the little one; I am sure\nfrom Jeff's description it is a noble babe--and as to its being a girl, it\nis all the better. (I am not sure but the Whitman breed gives better women\nthan men.)\n\nWell, mother, we are generally anticipating a lively time here, or in the\nneighborhood, as it is probable Lee is feeling about to strike a blow on\nWashington, or perhaps right into it--and as Lee is no fool, it is perhaps\npossible he may give us a good shake. He is not very far off--yesterday\nwas a fight to the southwest of here all day; we heard the cannons nearly\nall day. The wounded are arriving in small squads every day, mostly\ncavalry, a great many Ohio men; they send off to-day from the Washington\nhospitals a great many to New York, Philadelphia, etc., all who are able,\nto make room, which looks ominous--indeed, it is pretty certain that there\nis to be some severe fighting, may-be a great battle again, the pending\nweek. I am getting so callous that it hardly arouses me at all. I fancy I\nshould take it very quietly if I found myself in the midst of a desperate\nconflict here in Washington.\n\nMother, I have nothing particular to write about--I see and hear nothing\nbut new and old cases of my poor suffering boys in hospitals, and I dare\nsay you have had enough of such things. I have not missed a day at\nhospital, I think, for more than three weeks--I get more and more wound\nround. Poor young men--there are some cases that would literally sink and\ngive up if I did not pass a portion of the time with them. I have quite\nmade up my mind about the lecturing, etc., project--I have no doubt it\nwill succeed well enough the way I shall put it in operation. You know,\nmother, it is to raise funds to enable me to continue my hospital\nministrations, on a more free-handed scale. As to the Sanitary commissions\nand the like, I am sick of them all, and would not accept any of their\nberths. You ought to see the way the men, as they lay helpless in bed,\nturn away their faces from the sight of those agents, chaplains, etc.\n(hirelings, as Elias Hicks would call them--they seem to me always a set\nof foxes and wolves). They get well paid, and are always incompetent and\ndisagreeable; as I told you before, the only good fellows I have met are\nthe Christian commissioners--they go everywhere and receive no pay.\n\nDear, dear mother, I want much to see you, and dear Matty too; I send you\nboth my best love, and Jeff too. The pictures came--I have not heard from\nGeorge nor Han. I write a day earlier than usual.\n\n    WALT.\n\nWe here think Vicksburg is ours. The probability is that it has\ncapitulated--and there has been no general assault--can't tell yet whether\nthe 51st went there. We are having very fine weather here to-day--rained\nlast night.\n\n\nXV\n\n_Washington, June 30th, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Your letter, with Han's, I\nhave sent to George, though whether it will find him or not I cannot tell,\nas I think the 51st must be away down at Vicksburg. I have not had a word\nfrom George yet. Mother, I have had quite an attack of sore throat and\ndistress in my head for some days past, up to last night, but to-day I\nfeel nearly all right again. I have been about the city same as usual\nnearly--to the hospitals, etc., I mean. I am told that I hover too much\nover the beds of the hospitals, with fever and putrid wounds, etc. One\nsoldier brought here about fifteen days ago, very low with typhoid fever,\nLivingston Brooks, Co. B., 17th Penn. Cavalry, I have particularly stuck\nto, as I found him to be in what appeared to be a dying condition, from\nnegligence and a horrible journey of about forty miles, bad roads and fast\ndriving; and then after he got here, as he is a simple country boy, very\nshy and silent, and made no complaint, they neglected him. I found him\nsomething like I found John Holmes last winter. I called the doctor's\nattention to him, shook up the nurses, had him bathed in spirits, gave him\nlumps of ice, and ice to his head; he had a fearful bursting pain in his\nhead, and his body was like fire. He was very quiet, a very sensible boy,\nold fashioned; he did not want to die, and I had to lie to him without\nstint, for he thought I knew everything, and I always put in of course\nthat what I told him was exactly the truth, and that if he got really\ndangerous I would tell him and not conceal it. The rule is to remove bad\nfever patients out from the main wards to a tent by themselves, and the\ndoctor told me he would have to be removed. I broke it gently to him, but\nthe poor boy got it immediately in his head that he was marked with death,\nand was to be removed on that account. It had a great effect upon him, and\nalthough I told the truth this time it did not have as good a result as my\nformer fibs. I persuaded the doctor to let him remain. For three days he\nlay just about an even chance, go or stay, with a little leaning toward\nthe first. But, mother, to make a long story short, he is now out of any\nimmediate danger. He has been perfectly rational throughout--begins to\ntaste a little food (for a week he ate nothing; I had to compel him to\ntake a quarter of an orange now and then), and I will say, whether anyone\ncalls it pride or not, that if he _does_ get up and around again it's me\nthat saved his life. Mother, as I have said in former letters, you can\nhave no idea how these sick and dying youngsters cling to a fellow, and\nhow fascinating it is, with all its hospital surroundings of sadness and\nscenes of repulsion and death. In this same hospital, Armory-square, where\nthis cavalry boy is, I have about fifteen or twenty particular cases I see\nmuch to--some of them as much as him. There are two from East Brooklyn;\nGeorge Monk, Co. A, 78th N. Y., and Stephen Redgate (his mother is a widow\nin East Brooklyn--I have written to her). Both are pretty badly\nwounded--both are youngsters under 19. O mother, it seems to me as I go\nthrough these rows of cots as if it was too bad to accept these\n_children_, to subject them to such premature experiences. I devote myself\nmuch to Armory-square hospital because it contains by far the worst cases,\nmost repulsive wounds, has the most suffering and most need of\nconsolation. I go every day without fail, and often at night--sometimes\nstay very late. No one interferes with me, guards, nurses, doctors, nor\nanyone. I am let to take my own course.\n\nWell, mother, I suppose you folks think we are in a somewhat dubious\nposition here in Washington, with Lee in strong force almost between us\nand you Northerners. Well, it does look ticklish; if the Rebs cut the\nconnection then there will be fun. The Reb cavalry come quite near us,\ndash in and steal wagon trains, etc.; it would be funny if they should\ncome some night to the President's country house (Soldiers' home), where\nhe goes out to sleep every night; it is in the same direction as their\nsaucy raid last Sunday. Mr. Lincoln passes here (14th st.) every evening\non his way out. I noticed him last evening about half-past 6--he was in\nhis barouche, two horses, guarded by about thirty cavalry. The barouche\ncomes first under a slow trot, driven by one man in the box, no servant or\nfootman beside; the cavalry all follow closely after with a lieutenant at\ntheir head. I had a good view of the President last evening. He looks more\ncareworn even than usual, his face with deep cut lines, seams, and his\n_complexion gray_ through very dark skin--a curious looking man, very sad.\nI said to a lady who was looking with me, \"Who can see that man without\nlosing all wish to be sharp upon him personally?\" The lady assented,\nalthough she is almost vindictive on the course of the administration\n(thinks it wants nerve, etc.--the usual complaint). The equipage is rather\nshabby, horses indeed almost what my friends the Broadway drivers would\ncall _old plugs_. The President dresses in plain black clothes, cylinder\nhat--he was alone yesterday. As he came up, he first drove over to the\nhouse of the Sec. of War, on K st., about 300 feet from here; sat in his\ncarriage while Stanton came out and had a 15 minutes interview with him (I\ncan see from my window), and then wheeled around the corner and up\nFourteenth st., the cavalry after him. I really think it would be safer\nfor him just now to stop at the White House, but I expect he is too proud\nto abandon the former custom. Then about an hour after we had a large\ncavalry regiment pass, with blankets, arms, etc., on the war march over\nthe same track. The regt. was very full, over a thousand--indeed thirteen\nor fourteen hundred. It was an old regt., veterans, _old fighters_, young\nas they were. They were preceded by a fine mounted band of sixteen (about\nten bugles, the rest cymbals and drums). I tell you, mother, it made\neverything ring--made my heart leap. They played with a will. Then the\naccompaniment: the sabers rattled on a thousand men's sides--they had\npistols, their heels were spurred--handsome American young men (I make no\nacc't of any other); rude uniforms, well worn, but good cattle,\nprancing--all good riders, full of the devil; nobody shaved, very\nsunburnt. The regimental officers (splendidly mounted, but just as roughly\ndressed as the men) came immediately after the band, then company after\ncompany, with each its officers at its head--the tramps of so many horses\n(there is a good hard turnpike)--then a long train of men with led horses,\nmounted negroes, and a long, long string of baggage wagons, each with four\nhorses, and then a strong rear guard. I tell you it had the look of _real\nwar_--noble looking fellows; a man feels so proud on a good horse, and\narmed. They are off toward the region of Lee's (supposed) rendezvous,\ntoward Susquehannah, for the great anticipated battle. Alas! how many of\nthese healthy, handsome, rollicking young men will lie cold in death\nbefore the apples ripen in the orchard. Mother, it is curious and stirring\nhere in some respects. Smaller or larger bodies of troops are moving\ncontinually--many just-well men are turned out of the hospitals. I am\nwhere I see a good deal of them. There are getting to be _many black\ntroops_. There is one very good regt. here black as tar; they go around,\nhave the regular uniform--they submit to no nonsense. Others are\nconstantly forming. It is getting to be a common sight. [_The rest of the\nletter is lost._--ED.]\n\n\nXVI\n\n_Washington, July 10, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--I suppose you rec'd a letter\nfrom me last Wednesday, as I sent you one Tuesday (7th). Dear mother, I\nwas glad enough to hear from George, by that letter from Snyder's Bluffs,\nJune 28th. I had felt a little fear on acc't of some of those storming\nparties Grant sent against Vicksburg the middle of June and up to the\n20th--but this letter dispels all anxiety. I have written to George many\ntimes, but it seems he has not got them. Mother, I shall write\nimmediately to him again. I think he will get the letter I sent last\nSunday, as I directed it to Vicksburg--I told him all the news from home.\nMother, I shall write to Han and enclose George's letter. I am real glad\nto hear from Mat and the little one, all so favorable. We are having\npleasant weather here still. I go to Campbell hospital this afternoon--I\nstill keep going, mother. The wounded are doing rather badly; I am sorry\nto say there are frequent deaths--the weather, I suppose, which has been\npeculiarly bad for wounds, so wet and warm (though not disagreeable\noutdoors). Mother, you must write as often as you can, and Jeff too--you\nmust not get worried about the ups and downs of the war; I don't know any\ncourse but to resign oneself to events--if one can only bring one's mind\nto it. Good-bye once more, for the present, dearest mother, Mat, and the\ndear little ones.\n\n    WALT.\n\nMother, do you ever hear from Mary?[16]\n\n\nXVII\n\n_Washington, Wednesday forenoon, July 15, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--So the mob\nhas risen at last in New York--I have been expecting it, but as the day\nfor the draft had arrived and everything was so quiet, I supposed all\nmight go on smoothly; but it seems the passions of the people were only\nsleeping, and have burst forth with terrible fury, and they have destroyed\nlife and property, the enrolment buildings, etc., as we hear. The accounts\nwe get are a good deal in a muddle, but it seems bad enough. The feeling\nhere is savage and hot as fire against New York (the mob--\"Copperhead mob\"\nthe papers here call it), and I hear nothing in all directions but threats\nof ordering up the gunboats, cannonading the city, shooting down the mob,\nhanging them in a body, etc., etc. Meantime I remain silent, partly\namused, partly scornful, or occasionally put a dry remark, which only adds\nfuel to the flame. I do not feel it in my heart to abuse the poor people,\nor call for a rope or bullets for them, but, that is all the talk here,\neven in the hospitals. The acc'ts from N. Y. this morning are that the\nGov't has ordered the draft to be suspended there--I hope it is true, for\nI find that the deeper they go in with the draft, the more trouble it is\nlikely to make. I have changed my opinion and feelings on the subject--we\nare in the midst of strange and terrible times--one is pulled a dozen\ndifferent ways in his mind, and hardly knows what to think or do. Mother,\nI have not much fear that the troubles in New York will affect any of our\nfamily, still I feel somewhat uneasy about Jeff, if any one, as he is more\naround. I have had it much on my mind what could be done, if it should so\nhappen that Jeff should be drafted--of course he could not go without its\nbeing the downfall almost of our whole family, as you may say, Mat and\nhis young ones, and sad blow to you too, mother, and to all. I didn't see\nany other way than to try to raise the $300, mostly by borrowing if\npossible of Mr. Lane. Mother, I have no doubt I shall make a few hundred\ndollars by the lectures I shall certainly commence soon (for my hospital\nmissionary purposes and my own, for that purpose), and I could lend that\nam't to Jeff to pay it back. May-be the draft will not come off after all;\nI should say it was very doubtful if they can carry it out in N. Y. and\nBrooklyn--and besides, it is only one chance out of several, to be drawn\nif it does. I don't wonder dear brother Jeff feels the effect it would\nhave on domestic affairs; I think it is right to feel so, full as strongly\nas a man can. I do hope all will go well and without such an additional\ntrouble falling upon us, but as it can be met with money, I hope Jeff and\nMat and all of you, dear mother, will not worry any more about it. I wrote\nto Jeff a few lines last Sunday, I suppose he got. Mother, I don't know\nwhether you have had a kind of gloomy week the past week, but somehow I\nfeel as if you all had; but I hope it has passed over. How is dear sister\nMat, and how is Miss Mannahatta, and little Black Head? I sometimes feel\nas if I _must_ come home and see you all--I want to very much.\n\nMy hospital life still continues the same--I was in Armory all day\nyesterday--and day and night before. They have the men wounded in the\nrailroad accident at Laurel station (bet. here and Baltimore), about 30\nsoldiers, some of them horribly injured at 3 o'clock A. M. last Saturday\nby collision--poor, poor, poor men. I go again this afternoon and night--I\nsee so much of butcher sights, so much sickness and suffering, I must get\naway a while, I believe, for self-preservation. I have felt quite well\nthough the past week--we have had rain continually. Mother, I have not\nheard from George since, have you? I shall write Han to-day and send\nGeorge's letter--if you or Jeff has not written this week, I hope Jeff\nwill write on receiving this. Good-bye for present, dearest mother, and\nJeff, and Mat.\n\n    WALT.\n\nMother, the army is to be paid off two months more, right away. Of course\nGeorge will get two months more pay. Dear Mother, I hope you will keep\nuntouched and put in bank every cent you can. I want us to have a ranch\nsomewhere by or before next spring.\n\n\nXVIII\n\n_Washington, Aug. 11, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--I sent Jeff a letter on\nSunday--I suppose he got it at the office. I feel so anxious to hear from\nGeorge; one cannot help feeling uneasy, although these days sometimes it\ncannot help being long intervals without one's hearing from friends in\nthe army. O I do hope we shall hear soon, and that it is all right with\nhim. It seems as if the 9th Corps had returned to Vicksburg, and some\nacc'ts say that part of the Corps had started to come up the river\nagain--toward Kentucky, I suppose. I have sent George two letters within a\nweek past, hoping they might have the luck to get to him, but hardly\nexpect it either.\n\nMother, I feel very sorry to hear Andrew is so troubled in his throat yet.\nI know it must make you feel very unhappy. Jeff wrote me a good deal about\nit, and seems to feel very bad about Andrew's being unwell; but I hope it\nwill go over, and that a little time will make him recover--I think about\nit every day.\n\nMother, it has been the hottest weather here that I ever experienced, and\nstill continues so. Yesterday and last night was the hottest. Still, I\nslept sound, have good ventilation through my room, little as it is (I\nstill hire the same room in L street). I was quite wet with sweat this\nmorning when I woke up, a thing I never remember to have happened to me\nbefore, for I was not disturbed in my sleep and did not wake up once all\nnight. Mother, I believe I did not tell you that on the 1st of June (or a\nwhile before) the O'Connors, the friends I took my meals with so long,\nmoved to other apartments for more room and pleasanter--not far off\nthough, I am there every day almost, a little--so for nearly two months\nand a half I have been in the habit of getting my own breakfast in my room\nand my dinner at a restaurant. I have a little spirit lamp, and always\nhave a capital cup of tea, and some bread, and perhaps some preserved\nfruit; for dinner I get a good plate of meat and plenty of potatoes, good\nand plenty for 25 or 30 cents. I hardly ever take any thing more than\nthese two meals, both of them are pretty hearty--eat dinner about 3--my\nappetite is plenty good enough, and I am about as fleshy as I was in\nBrooklyn. Mother, I feel better the last ten days, and at present, than I\ndid the preceding six or eight weeks. There was nothing particular the\nmatter with me, but I suppose a different climate and being so continually\nin the hospitals--but as I say, I feel better, more strength, and better\nin my head, etc. About the wound in my hand and the inflammation, etc., it\nhas thoroughly healed, and I have not worn anything on my hand, nor had\nany dressing for the last five days. Mother, I hope you get along with the\nheat, for I see it is as bad or worse in New York and Brooklyn--I am\nafraid you suffer from it; it must be distressing to you. Dear mother, do\nlet things go, and just sit still and fan yourself. I think about you\nthese hot days. I fancy I see you down there in the basement. I suppose\nyou have your coffee for breakfast; I have not had three cups of coffee in\nsix months--tea altogether (I must come home and have some coffee for\nbreakfast with you).\n\nMother, I wrote to you about Erastus Haskell, Co. K, 141st, N. Y.--his\nfather, poor old man, come on here to see him and found him dead three\ndays. He had the body embalmed and took home. They are poor folks but very\nrespectable. I was at the hospital yesterday as usual--I never miss a day.\nI go by my feelings--if I should feel that it would be better for me to\nlay by for a while, I should do so, but not while I feel so well as I do\nthe past week, for all the hot weather; and while the chance lasts I would\nimprove it, for by and by the night cometh when no man can work (ain't I\ngetting pious!). I got a letter from Probasco yesterday; he sent $4 for my\nsick and wounded--I wish Jeff to tell him that it came right, and give him\nthe men's thanks and my love.\n\nMother, have you heard anything from Han? And about Mary's Fanny--I hope\nyou will write me soon and tell me everything, tell me exactly as things\nare, but I know you will--I want to hear family affairs before anything\nelse. I am so glad to hear Mat is good and hearty--you must write me about\nHat and little Black Head too. Mother, how is Eddy getting along? and\nJess, is he about the same? I suppose Will Brown is home all right; tell\nhim I spoke about him, and the Browns too. Dearest Mother, I send you my\nlove, and to Jeff too--must write when you can.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXIX\n\n_Washington, Aug. 18, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--I was mighty glad to get\nGeorge's letter, I can tell you--you have not heard since, I suppose. They\nmust be now back again in Kentucky, or that way, as I see [by] a letter\nfrom Cairo (up the Mississippi river) that boats had stopt there with the\n9th Corps on from Vicksburg, going up towards Cincinnati--I think the\nletter was dated Aug. 10. I have no doubt they are back again up that way\nsomewhere. I wrote to George four or five days ago--I directed it Ohio,\nMississippi, or elsewhere. Mother, I was very glad indeed to get your\nletter--I am so sorry Andrew does not get any better; it is very\ndistressing about losing the voice; he must not be so much alarmed, as\nthat continues some times years and the health otherwise good. ..........\nMother, I wrote to Han about five days ago; told her we had heard from\nGeorge, and all the news--I must write to Mary too, without fail--I should\nlike to hear from them all, and from Fanny. There has been a young man\nhere in hospital, from Farmingdale; he was wounded; his name is\nHendrickson; he has gone home on a furlough; he knows the Van Nostrands\nvery well--I told him to go and see Aunt Fanny. I was glad you gave Emma\nPrice my direction here; I should [like] to hear from Mrs. Price and her\ngirls first rate, I think a great deal about them--and mother, I wish you\nto tell any of them so; they always used me first rate, and always stuck\nup for me--if I knew their street and number I should write.\n\nIt has been awful hot here now for twenty-one days; ain't that a spell of\nweather? The first two weeks I got along better than I would have thought,\nbut the last week I have felt it more, have felt it in my head a little--I\nno more stir without my umbrella, in the day time, than I would without my\nboots. I am afraid of the sun affecting my head and move pretty cautious.\nMother, I think every day, I wonder if the hot weather is affecting mother\nmuch; I suppose it must a good deal, but I hope it cannot last much\nlonger. Mother, I had a letter in the N. Y. _Times_ of last Sunday--did\nyou see it? I wonder if George can't get a furlough and come home for a\nwhile; that furlough he had was only a flea-bite. If he could it would be\nno more than right, for no man in the country has done his duty more\nfaithful, and without complaining of anything or asking for anything, than\nGeorge. I suppose they will fill up the 51st with conscripts, as that\nseems the order of the day--a good many are arriving here, from the North,\nand passing through to join Meade's army. We are expecting to hear of more\nrows in New York about the draft; it commences there right away I\nsee--this time it will be no such doings as a month or five weeks ago; the\nGov't here is forwarding a large force of regulars to New York to be ready\nfor anything that may happen--there will be no blank cartridges this time.\nWell, I thought when I first heard of the riot in N. Y. I had some\nfeeling for them, but soon as I found what it really was, I felt it was\nthe devil's own work all through. I guess the strong arm will be exhibited\nthis time up to the shoulder. Mother, I want to see you and all very much.\nAs I wish to be here at the opening of Congress, and during the winter, I\nhave an idea I will try to come home for a month, but I don't know when--I\nwant to see the young ones and Mat and Jeff and everybody. Well, mother, I\nshould like to know all the domestic affairs at home; don't you have the\nusual things eating, etc.? Why, mother, I should think you would eat\nnearly all your meals with Mat--I know you must when they have anything\ngood (and I know Mat will have good things if she has got a cent left).\nMother, don't you miss _Walt_ loafing around, and carting himself off to\nNew York toward the latter part of every afternoon? How do you and the\nBrowns get along?--that hell hole over the way, what a nuisance it must be\nnights, and I generally have a very good sleep. Mother, I suppose you\nsleep in the back room yet--I suppose the new houses next door are\noccupied. How I should like to take a walk on old Fort Greene--tell\nMannahatta her Uncle Walt will be home yet, from the sick soldiers, and\nhave a good walk all around, if she behaves to her grandmother and don't\ncut up. Mother, I am scribbling this hastily in Major Hapgood's office; it\nis not so hot to-day, quite endurable. I send you my love, dear mother,\nand to all, and wish Jeff and you to write as often as you can.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXX\n\n_Washington, Aug. 25, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--The letter from George, and your\nlines, and a few from Jeff came yesterday, and I was glad indeed to be\ncertain that George had got back to Kentucky safe and well--while so many\nfall that we know, or, what is about as bad, get sick or hurt in the\nfight, and lay in hospital, it seems almost a miracle that George should\nhave gone through so much, South and North and East and West, and been in\nso many hard-fought battles, and thousands of miles of weary and\nexhausting marches, and yet have stood it so, and be yet alive and in good\nhealth and spirits. O mother, what would we [have] done if it had been\notherwise--if he had met the fate of so many we know--if he had been\nkilled or badly hurt in some of those battles? I get thinking about it\nsometimes, and it works upon me so I have to stop and turn my mind on\nsomething else. Mother, I feel bad enough about Andrew, and I know it must\nbe so with you too--one don't know what to do; if we had money he would be\nwelcome to it, if it would do any good. If George's money comes from\nKentucky this last time, and you think some of it would do Andrew any real\ngood, I advise you to take some and give him--I think it would be proper\nand George would approve of it. I believe there is not much but trouble\nin this world, and if one hasn't any for himself he has it made up by\nhaving it brought close to him through others, and that is sometimes worse\nthan to have it touch one's self. Mother, you must not let Andrew's case\nand the poor condition of his household comforts, etc., work upon you, for\nI fear you will--but, mother, it's no use to worry about such things. I\nhave seen so much horrors that befall men (so bad and such suffering and\nmutilations, etc., that the poor men can defy their fate to do anything\nmore or any harder misfortune or worse a-going) that I sometimes think I\nhave grown callous--but no, I don't think it is that, but nothing of\nordinary misfortune seems as it used to, and death itself has lost all its\nterrors--I have seen so many cases in which it was so welcome and such a\nrelief.\n\nMother, you must just resign yourself to things that occur--but I hardly\nthink it is necessary to give you any charge about it, for I think you\nhave done so for many years, and stood it all with good courage.\n\nWe have a second attack of hot weather--Sunday was the most burning day I\never yet saw. It is very dry and dusty here, but to-day we are having a\nmiddling good breeze--I feel pretty well, and whenever the weather for a\nday or so is passably cool I feel really first rate, so I anticipate the\ncooler season with pleasure. Mother, I believe I wrote to you I had a\nletter in N. Y. _Times_, Sunday, 16th--I shall try to write others and\nmore frequently. The three _Eagles_ came safe; I was glad to get them--I\nsent them and another paper to George. Mother, none of you ever mention\nwhether you get my letters, but I suppose they come safe--it is not\nimpossible I may miss some week, but I have not missed a single one for\nmonths past. I wish I could send you something worth while, and I wish I\ncould send something for Andrew--mother, write me exactly how it is with\nhim.... Mother, I have some idea Han is getting some better; it is only my\nidea somehow--I hope it is so from the bottom of my heart. Did you hear\nfrom Mary's Fanny since? And how are Mat's girls? So, Mannahatta, you tear\nUncle George's letters, do you? You mustn't do so, little girl, nor Uncle\nWalt's either; but when you get to be a big girl you must have them all\nnice, and read them, for Grandmother will perhaps leave them to you in her\nwill, if you behave like a lady. Matty, my dear sister, how are you\ngetting along? I really want to see you bad, and the baby too--well,\nmay-be we shall all come together and have some good times yet. Jeff, I\nhope by next week this time we shall be in possession of Charleston--some\npapers say Burnside is moving for Knoxville, but it is doubtful--I think\nthe 9th Corps might take a rest awhile, anyhow. Good-bye, mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXI\n\n_Washington, Sept. 1, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--I have been thinking to-day and\nall yesterday about the draft in Brooklyn, and whether Jeff would be\ndrafted; you must some of you write me just as soon as you get this--I\nwant to know; I feel anxious enough I can tell you--and besides, it seems\na good while since I have received any letters from home. Of course it is\nimpossible for Jeff to go, in case it should turn out he was drafted--the\nway our family is all situated now, it would be madness. If the Common\nCouncil raise the money to exempt men with families dependent on them, I\nthink Jeff ought to have no scruples in taking advantage of it, as I think\nhe is in duty bound--but we will see what course to take, when we know the\nresult, etc.; write about it right away.\n\nThe _Eagles_ came; this is the second time; I am glad to get them--Jeff,\nwait till you get four or five, and then send them with a two-cent stamp.\nI have not had any letter from George. Mother, have you heard anything?\ndid the money come? Dear mother, how are you nowadays? I do hope you feel\nwell and in good spirits--I think about you every day of my life out here.\nSometimes I see women in the hospitals, mothers come to see their sons,\nand occasionally one that makes me think of my dear mother--one did very\nmuch, a lady about 60, from Pennsylvania, come to see her son, a captain,\nvery badly wounded and his wound gangrened, and they after a while\nremoved him to a tent by himself. Another son of hers, a young man, came\nwith her to see his brother. She was a pretty full-sized lady, with\nspectacles; she dressed in black--looked real Velsory.[17] I got very well\nacquainted with her; she had a real Long Island old-fashioned way--but I\nhad to avoid the poor captain, as it was that time that my hand was cut in\nthe artery, and I was liable to gangrene myself--but she and the two sons\nhave gone home now, but I doubt whether the wounded one is alive, as he\nwas very low. Mother, I want to hear about Andrew too, whether he went to\nRockland lake. You have no idea how many soldiers there are who have lost\ntheir voices, and have to speak in whispers--there are a great many, I\nmeet some almost every day; as far as that alone is concerned, Andrew must\nnot be discouraged, as the general health may be good as common\nirrespective of that. I do hope Andrew will get along better than he\nthinks for--it is bad enough for a poor man to be out of health even\npartially, but he must try to look on the bright side. Mother, have you\nheard anything from Han since, or from Mary's folks? I got a letter from\nMrs. Price last week; if you see Emma tell her I was pleased to get it,\nand shall answer it very soon. Mother, I have sent another letter to the\nN. Y. _Times_--it may appear, if not to-day, within a few days. I am\nfeeling excellent well these days, it is so moderate and pleasant weather\nnow; I was getting real exhausted with the heat. I thought of you too, how\nit must have exhausted you those hot days. I still occupy the same 3rd\nstory room, 394 L st., and get my breakfast in my room in the morning\nmyself, and dinner at a restaurant about 3 o'clock--I get along very well\nand very economical (which is a forced put, but just as well). But I must\nget another room or a boarding-house soon, as the folks are all going to\nmove this month. My good and real friends the O'Connors live in the same\nblock; I am in there every day. Dear mother, tell Mat and Miss Mannahatta\nI send them my love--I want to see them both. O how I want to see Jeff and\nyou, mother; I sometimes feel as if I should just get in the cars and come\nhome--and the baby too, you must always write about her. Dear mother,\ngood-bye for present.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXII\n\n_Washington, Sept. 8, 1863, Tuesday morning._ DEAREST MOTHER--I wrote to\nJeff Sunday last that his letter sent Sept. 3rd, containing your letter\nand $5 from Mr. Lane, had miscarried--this morning when I came down to\nMajor Hapgood's office I found it on my table, so it is all\nright--singular where it has been all this while, as I see the postmark on\nit is Brooklyn, Sept. 3, as Jeff said. Mother, what to do about Andrew I\nhardly know--as it is I feel about as much pity for you as I do for my\npoor brother Andrew, for I know you will worry yourself about him all the\ntime. I was in hopes it was only the trouble about the voice, etc., but I\nsee I was mistaken, and it is probably worse. I know you and Jeff and Mat\nwill do all you can--and will have patience with all (it is not only the\nsick who are poorly off, but their friends; but it is best to have the\ngreatest forbearance, and do and give, etc., whatever one can--but you\nknow that, and practice it too, dear mother). Mother, if I had the means,\nO how cheerfully I would give them, whether they availed anything for\nAndrew or not--yet I have long made up my mind that money does not amount\nto so much, at least not so very much, in serious cases of sickness; it is\njudgment both in the person himself, and in those he has to do with--and\ngood heart in everything. (Mother, you remember Theodore Gould, how he\nstuck it out, though sickness and death has had hold of him, as you may\nsay, for fifteen years.) But anyhow, I hope we will all do what we can for\nAndrew. Mother, I think I must try to come home for a month--I have not\ngiven up my project of lecturing I spoke about before, but shall put it in\npractice yet; I feel clear it will succeed enough. (I wish I had some of\nthe money already; it would be satisfaction to me to contribute something\nto Andrew's necessities, for he must have bread.) I will write to you, of\ncourse, before I come. Mother, I hope you will live better--Jeff tells me\nyou and Jess and Ed live on poor stuff, you are so economical. Mother, you\nmustn't do so as long as you have a cent--I hope you will, at least four\nor five times a week, have a steak of beef or mutton, or something\nsubstantial for dinner. I have one good meal of that kind every day, or at\nleast five or six days out of the seven--but for breakfast I have nothing\nbut a cup of tea and some bread or crackers (first-rate tea though, with\nmilk and good white sugar). Well, I find it is hearty enough--more than\nhalf the time I never eat anything after dinner, and when I do it is only\na cracker and cup of tea. Mother, I hope you will not stint yourselves--as\nto using George's money for your and Jess's and Ed's needful living\nexpenses, I know George would be mad and hurt in his feelings if he\nthought you was afraid to. Mother, you have a comfortable time as much as\nyou can, and get a steak occasionally, won't you? I suppose Mat got her\nletter last Saturday; I sent it Friday. O I was so pleased that Jeff was\nnot drawn, and I know how Mat must have felt too; I have no idea the\nGovernment will try to draft again, whatever happens--they have carried\ntheir point, but have not made much out of it. O how the conscripts and\nsubstitutes are deserting down in front and on their way there--you don't\nhear anything about it, but it is incredible--they don't allow it to get\nin the papers. Mother, I was so glad to get your letter; you must write\nagain--can't you write to-morrow, so I can get it Friday or\nSaturday?--you know though you wrote more than a week ago I did not get it\ntill this morning. I wish Jeff to write too, as often as he can. Mother, I\nwas gratified to hear you went up among the soldiers--they are rude in\nappearance, but they know what is decent, and it pleases them much to have\nfolks, even old women, take an interest and come among them. Mother, you\nmust go again, and take Mat. Well, dear mother, I must close. I am first\nrate in health, so much better than a month and two months ago--my hand\nhas entirely healed. I go to hospital every day or night--I believe no men\never loved each other as I and some of these poor wounded sick and dying\nmen love each other. Good-bye, dearest mother, for present.\n\n    WALT.\n\n_Tuesday afternoon._ Mother, it seems to be certain that Meade has gained\nthe day, and that the battles there in Pennsylvania have been about as\nterrible as any in the war--I think the killed and wounded there on both\nsides were as many as eighteen or twenty thousand--in one place, four or\nfive acres, there were a thousand dead at daybreak on Saturday morning.\nMother, one's heart grows sick of war, after all, when you see what it\nreally is; every once in a while I feel so horrified and disgusted--it\nseems to me like a great slaughter-house and the men mutually butchering\neach other--then I feel how impossible it appears, again, to retire from\nthis contest, until we have carried our points (it is cruel to be so\ntossed from pillar to post in one's judgment). Washington is a pleasant\nplace in some respects--it has the finest trees, and plenty of them\neverywhere, on the streets and grounds. The Capitol grounds, though small,\nhave the finest cultivated trees I ever see--there is a great variety, and\nnot one but is in perfect condition. After I finish this letter I am going\nout there for an hour's recreation. The great sights of Washington are the\npublic buildings, the wide streets, the public grounds, the trees, the\nSmithsonian institute and grounds. I go to the latter occasionally--the\ninstitute is an old fogy concern, but the grounds are fine. Sometimes I go\nup to Georgetown, about two and a half miles up the Potomac, an old\ntown--just opposite it in the river is an island, where the niggers have\ntheir first Washington reg't encamped. They make a good show, are often\nseen in the streets of Washington in squads. Since they have begun to\ncarry arms, the Secesh here and in Georgetown (about three fifths) are not\ninsulting to them as formerly.\n\nOne of the things here always on the go is long trains of army\nwagons--sometimes they will stream along all day; it almost seems as if\nthere was nothing else but army wagons and ambulances. They have great\ncamps here in every direction, of army wagons, teamsters, ambulance camps,\netc.; some of them are permanent, and have small hospitals. I go to them\n(as no one else goes; ladies would not venture). I sometimes have the\nluck to give some of the drivers a great deal of comfort and help. Indeed,\nmother, there are camps here of everything--I went once or twice to the\ncontraband camp, to the hospital, etc., but I could not bring myself to go\nagain--when I meet black men or boys among my own hospitals, I use them\nkindly, give them something, etc.--I believe I told you that I do the same\nto the wounded Rebels, too--but as there is a limit to one's sinews and\nendurance and sympathies, etc., I have got in the way, after going\nlightly, as it were, all through the wards of a hospital, and trying to\ngive a word of cheer, if nothing else, to every one, then confining my\nspecial attentions to the few where the investment seems to tell best, and\nwho want it most. Mother, I have real pride in telling you that I have the\nconsciousness of saving quite a number of lives by saving them from giving\nup--and being a good deal with them; the men say it is so, and the doctors\nsay it is so--and I will candidly confess I can see it is true, though I\nsay it of myself. I know you will like to hear it, mother, so I tell you.\nI am finishing this in Major Hapgood's office, about 1 o'clock--it is\npretty warm, but has not cleared off yet. The trees look so well from\nwhere I am, and the Potomac--it is a noble river; I see it several miles,\nand the Arlington heights. Mother, I see some of the 47th Brooklyn every\nday or two; the reg't is on the heights back of Arlington house, a fine\ncamp ground. O Matty, I have just thought of you--dear sister, how are\nyou getting along? Jeff, I will write you truly. Good-bye for the\npresent, dearest mother, and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXIII\n\n_Washington, Sept. 15, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--Your letters were very\nacceptable--one came just as I was putting my last in the post office--I\nguess they all come right. I have written to Han and George and sent\nGeorge papers. Mother, have you heard anything whether the 51st went on\nwith Burnside, or did they remain as a reserve in Kentucky? Burnside has\nmanaged splendidly so far, his taking Knoxville and all together--it is a\nfirst-class success. I have known Tennessee Union men here in hospital,\nand I understand it, therefore--the region where Knoxville is is mainly\nUnion, but the Southerners could not exist without it, as it is in their\nmidst, so they determined to pound and kill and crush out the\nUnionists--all the savage and monstrous things printed in the papers about\ntheir treatment are true, at least that kind of thing is, as bad as the\nIrish in the mob treated the poor niggers in New York. We North don't\nunderstand some things about Southerners; it is very strange, the\ncontrast--if I should pick out the most genuine Union men and real\npatriots I have ever met in all my experience, I should pick out two or\nthree Tennessee and Virginia Unionists I have met in the hospitals,\nwounded or sick. One young man I guess I have mentioned to you in my\nletters, John Barker, 2nd Tennessee Vol. (Union), was a long while a\nprisoner in Secesh prisons in Georgia, and in Richmond--three times the\ndevils hung him up by the heels to make him promise to give up his\nUnionism; once he was cut down for dead. He is a young married man with\none child. His little property destroyed, his wife and child turned\nout--he hunted and tormented--and any moment he could have had anything if\nhe would join the Confederacy--but he was firm as a rock; he would not\neven take an oath to not fight for either side. They held him about eight\nmonths--then he was very sick, scurvy, and they exchanged him and he came\nup from Richmond here to hospital; here I got acquainted with him. He is a\nlarge, slow, good-natured man, somehow made me often think of father;\nshrewd, very little to say--wouldn't talk to anybody but me. His whole\nthought was to get back and fight; he was not fit to go, but he has gone\nback to Tennessee. He spent two days with his wife and young one there,\nand then to his regiment--he writes to me frequently and I to him; he is\nnot fit to soldier, for the Rebels have destroyed his health and strength\n(though he is only 23 or 4), but nothing will keep him from his regiment,\nand fighting--he is uneducated, but as sensible a young man as I ever met,\nand understands the whole question. Well, mother, Jack Barker is the most\ngenuine Union man I have ever yet met. I asked him once very gravely why\nhe didn't take the Southern oath and get his liberty--if he didn't think\nhe was foolish to be so stiff, etc. I never saw such a look as he gave me,\nhe thought I was in earnest--the old devil himself couldn't have had put a\nworse look in his eyes. Mother, I have no doubt there are quite a good\nmany just such men. He is down there with his regiment (one of his\nbrothers was killed)--when he fails in strength he gets the colonel to\ndetach him to do teamster's duty for a few days, on a march till he\nrecruits his strength--but he always carries his gun with him--in a battle\nhe is always in the ranks--then he is so sensible, such decent manly ways,\nnothing shallow or mean (he must have been a giant in health, but now he\nis weaker, has a cough too). Mother, can you wonder at my getting so\nattached to such men, with such love, especially when they show it to\nme--some of them on their dying beds, and in the very hour of death, or\njust the same when they recover, or partially recover? I never knew what\nAmerican young men were till I have been in the hospitals. Well, mother, I\nhave got writing on--there is nothing new with me, just the same old\nthing, as I suppose it is with you there. Mother, how is Andrew? I wish to\nhear all about him--I do hope he is better, and that it will not prove\nanything so bad. I will write to him soon myself, but in the meantime you\nmust tell him to not put so much faith in medicine--drugs, I mean--as in\nthe true curative things; namely, diet and careful habits, breathing good\nair, etc. You know I wrote in a former letter what is the cause and\nfoundation of the diseases of the throat and what must be the remedy that\ngoes to the bottom of the thing--sudden attacks are to be treated with\napplications and medicines, but diseases of a seated character are not to\nbe cured by them, only perhaps a little relieved (and often aggravated,\nmade firmer).\n\nDearest mother, I hope you yourself are well, and getting along good.\nAbout the letter in the _Times_, I see ever since I sent they have been\nvery crowded with news that must be printed--I think they will give it\nyet. I hear there is a new paper in Brooklyn, or to be one--I wish Jeff\nwould send me some of the first numbers without fail, and a stray _Eagle_\nin same parcel to make up the 4 ounces. I am glad to hear Mat was going to\nwrite me a good long letter--every letter from home is so good, when one\nis away (I often see the men crying in the hospital when they get a\nletter). Jeff too, I want him to write whenever he can, and not forget the\nnew paper. We are having pleasant weather here; it is such a relief from\nthat awful heat (I can't think of another such siege without feeling sick\nat the thought).\n\nMother, I believe I told you I had written to Mrs. Price--do you see Emma?\nAre the soldiers still on Fort Greene? Well, mother, I have writ quite a\nletter--it is between 2 and 3 o'clock--I am in Major Hapgood's all\nalone--from my window I see all the Potomac, and all around\nWashington--Major and all gone down to the army to pay troops, and I keep\nhouse. I am invited to dinner to-day at 4 o'clock at a Mr. Boyle's--I am\ngoing (hope we shall have something good). Dear mother, I send you my\nlove, and some to Jeff and Mat and all, not forgetting Mannahatta (who I\nhope is a help and comfort to her grandmother). Well, I must scratch off\nin a hurry, for it is nearly an hour [later] than I thought. Good-bye for\nthe present, dear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXIV\n\n_Washington, Sept. 29, 1863._ DEAR MOTHER--Well, here I sit this forenoon\nin a corner by the window in Major Hapgood's office, all the Potomac, and\nMaryland, and Virginia hills in sight, writing my Tuesday letter to you,\ndearest mother. Major has gone home to Boston on sick leave, and only the\nclerk and me occupy the office, and he not much of the time. At the\npresent moment there are two wounded officers come in to get their\npay--one has crutches; the other is drest in the light-blue uniform of the\ninvalid corps. Way up here on the 5th floor it is pretty hard scratching\nfor cripples and very weak men to journey up here--often they come up here\nvery weary and faint, and then find out they can't get their money, some\nred-tape hitch, and the poor soldiers look so disappointed--it always\nmakes me feel bad.\n\nMother, we are having perfect weather here nowadays, both night and day.\nThe nights are wonderful; for the last three nights as I have walked home\nfrom the hospital pretty late, it has seemed to me like a dream, the moon\nand sky ahead of anything I ever see before. Mother, do you hear anything\nfrom George? I wrote to him yesterday and sent him your last letter, and\nJeff's enclosed--I shall send him some papers to-day--I send him papers\nquite often. (Why hasn't Jeff sent me the _Union_ with my letter in? I\nwant much to see it, and whether they have misprinted it.)\n\nMother, I don't think the 51st has been in any of the fighting we know of\ndown there yet--what is to come of course nobody can tell. As to Burnside,\nI suppose you know he is among his _friends_, and I think this quite\nimportant, for such the main body of East Tennesseans are, and are far\ntruer Americans anyhow than the Copperheads of the North. The Tennesseans\nwill fight for us too. Mother, you have no idea how the soldiers, sick,\netc. (I mean the American ones, to a man) all feel about the Copperheads;\nthey never speak of them without a curse, and I hear them say, with an air\nthat shows they mean it, they would shoot them sooner than they would a\nRebel. Mother, the troops from Meade's army are passing through here night\nand day, going West and so down to reinforce Rosecrans I suppose--the\npapers are not permitted to mention it, but it is so. Two Army Corps, I\nshould think, have mostly passed--they go through night and day--I hear\nthe whistle of the locomotive screaming away any time at night when I wake\nup, and the rumbling of the trains.\n\nMother dear, you must write to me soon, and so must Jeff. I thought Mat\nwas going to send me a great long letter--I am always looking for it; I\nhope it will be full of everything about family matters and doings, and\nhow everybody really is. I go to Major's box three or four times a day. I\nwant to hear also about Andrew, and indeed about every one of you and\neverything--nothing is too trifling, nothing uninteresting.\n\nO mother, who do you think I got a letter from, two or three days ago?\nAunt Fanny, Ansel's mother--she sent it by a young man, a wounded soldier\nwho has been home to Farmingdale on furlough, and lately returned. She\nwrites a first-rate letter, Quaker all over--I shall answer it. She says\nMary and Ansel and all are well. I have received another letter from Mrs.\nPrice--she has not good health. I am sorry for her from my heart; she is a\ngood, noble woman, no better kind. Mother, I am in the hospitals as\nusual--I stand it better the last three weeks than ever before--I go among\nthe worst fevers and wounds with impunity. I go among the smallpox, etc.,\njust the same--I feel to go without apprehension, and so I go. Nobody else\ngoes; and as the darkey said there at Charleston when the boat run on a\nflat and the Reb sharpshooters were peppering them, \"somebody must jump in\nde water and shove de boat off.\"\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXV\n\n_Washington, Oct. 6, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Your letter and George's came\nsafe--dear brother George, one don't more than get a letter from him\nbefore you want to hear again, especially as things are looking pretty\nstormy that way--but mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is\nstill in Kentucky, at or near where George last wrote; but of course that\nis only my guess. I send George papers and occasionally letters. Mother, I\nsent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not\nto tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him; but\nI sent it. Mother, I think Rosecrans and Burnside will be too much for the\nRebels down there yet. I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in\nthe midst of _friends_, and such friends too--they will fight and fight up\nto the handle, and kill somebody (it seems as if it was coming to that\npass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed). Mother, I wish\nyou would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, and tell me\nabout Andrew, if there is anything different with him--I think about him\nevery day and night. I believe I must come home, even if it is only for a\nweek--I want to see you all very much. Mother, I know you must have a\ngreat deal to harass and trouble you; I don't mean about Andrew\npersonally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, and\ndo anything to nourish him, but about the children and Nancy--but, mother,\nyou must not let anything chafe you, and you must not be squeamish about\nsaying firmly at times not to have little Georgy too much to trouble you\n(poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he\ngrows older); and while you are pleasant with Nancy you must be\nsufficiently plain with her--only, mother, I know you will, and Jeff and\nMat will too, be invariably good to Andrew, and not mind his being\nirritable at times; it is his disease, and then his temper is naturally\nfretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness--and always do\nanything for him that you can in reason. Mat, my dear sister, I know you\nwill, for I know your nature is to come out a first-class girl in times of\ntrouble and sickness, and do anything. Mother, you don't know how pleased\nI was to read what you wrote about little Sis. I want to see her so bad I\ndon't know what to do; I know she must be just the best young one on Long\nIsland--but I hope it will not be understood as meaning any slight or\ndisrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle\nWalt, I hope, has heart and gizzard big enough for both his little nieces\nand as many more as the Lord may send.\n\nMother, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office, as usual. I am all\nalone to-day--Major is still absent, unwell, and the clerk is away\nsomewhere. O how pleasant it is here--the weather I mean--and other things\ntoo, for that matter. I still occupy my little room, 394 L st.; get my own\nbreakfast there; had good tea this morning, and some nice biscuit\n(yesterday morning and day before had peaches cut up). My friends the\nO'Connors that I wrote about recommenced cooking the 1st of this month\n(they have been, as usual in summer, taking their meals at a family hotel\nnear by). Saturday they sent for me to breakfast, and Sunday I eat dinner\nwith them--very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes, etc.\nThey are truly friends to me. I still get my dinner at a restaurant\nusually. I have a very good plain dinner, which is the only meal of any\naccount I make during the day; but it is just as well, for I would be in\ndanger of getting fat on the least encouragement, and I have no ambition\nthat way. Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, and that\nthings are upon the whole pleasant personally, for every day of my life I\nsee enough to make one's heart ache with sympathy and anguish here in the\nhospitals, and I do not know as I could stand it if it was not\ncounterbalanced outside. It is curious, when I am present at the most\nappalling things--deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of\nmaggots)--I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but\nkeep singularly cool; but often hours afterward, perhaps when I am home\nor out walking alone, I feel sick and actually tremble when I recall the\nthing and have it in my mind again before me. Mother, did you see my\nletter in the N. Y. _Times_ of Sunday, Oct. 4? That was the long-delayed\nletter. Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the _Union_ with my\nletter in--I wish very much he could do so yet; and always when I have a\nletter in a paper I would like to have one sent. If you take the _Union_,\nsend me some once in a while. Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those?\nTell him if so I was much obliged; and if he or Mr. and Mrs. Brown take\nany interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let them read the\nletters, of course. O, I must not close without telling you the highly\nimportant intelligence that I have cut my hair and beard--since the event\nRosecrans, Charleston, etc., etc., have among my acquaintances been hardly\nmentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison. Jeff, my dearest\nbrother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or\nthree weeks past; will try to yet, so it will reach you for Sunday\nreading--so good-bye, Jeff, and good-bye for present, mother dear, and\nall, and tell Andrew he must not be discouraged yet.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXVI\n\n_Washington, Oct. 11, 1863._ DEAR FRIEND[18]--Your letters were both\nreceived, and were indeed welcome. Don't mind my not answering them\npromptly, for you know what a wretch I am about such things. But you must\nwrite just as often as you conveniently can. Tell me all about your folks,\nespecially the girls, and about Mr. A. Of course you won't forget\nArthur,[19] and always when you write to him send my love. Tell me about\nMrs. U. and the dear little rogues. Tell Mrs. B. she ought to be here,\nhospital matron, only it is a harder pull than folks anticipate. You wrote\nabout Emma;[20] she thinks she might and ought to come as nurse for the\nsoldiers. Dear girl, I know it would be a blessed thing for the men to\nhave her loving spirit and hand, and whoever of the poor fellows had them\nwould indeed think it so. But, my darling, it is a dreadful thing--you\ndon't know these wounds, sickness, etc., the sad condition in which many\nof the men are brought here, and remain for days; sometimes the wounds\nfull of crawling corruption, etc. Down in the field-hospitals in front\nthey have no proper care (can't have), and after a battle go for many days\nunattended to.\n\nAbby, I think often about you and the pleasant days, the visits I used to\npay you, and how good it was always to be made so welcome. O, I wish I\ncould come in this afternoon and have a good tea with you, and have three\nor four hours of mutual comfort, and rest and talk, and be all of us\ntogether again. Is Helen home and well? and what is she doing now? And\nyou, my dear friend, how sorry I am to hear that your health is not\nrugged--but, dear Abby, you must not dwell on anticipations of the worst\n(but I know that is not your nature, or did not use to be). I hope this\nwill find you quite well and in good spirits. I feel so well myself--I\nwill have to come and see you, I think--I am so fat, out considerable in\nthe open air, and all red and tanned worse than ever. You see, therefore,\nthat my life amid these sad and death-stricken hospitals has not told upon\nme, for I am this fall so running over with health, and I feel as if I\nought to go on, on that account, working among all the sick and deficient;\nand O how gladly I would bestow upon you a liberal share of my health,\ndear Abby, if such a thing were possible.\n\nI am continually moving around among the hospitals. One I go to oftenest\nthe last three months is \"Armory-square,\" as it is large, generally full\nof the worst wounds and sickness, and is among the least visited. To this\nor some other I never miss a day or evening. I am enabled to give the men\nsomething, and perhaps some trifle to their supper all around. Then there\nare always special cases calling for something special. Above all the poor\nboys welcome magnetic friendship, personality (some are so fervent, so\nhungering for this)--poor fellows, how young they are, lying there with\ntheir pale faces, and that mute look in their eyes. O, how one gets to\nlove them--often, particular cases, so suffering, so good, so manly and\naffectionate! Abby, you would all smile to see me among them--many of them\nlike children. Ceremony is mostly discarded--they suffer and get exhausted\nand so weary--not a few are on their dying beds--lots of them have grown\nto expect, as I leave at night, that we should kiss each other, sometimes\nquite a number; I have to go round, poor boys. There is little petting in\na soldier's life in the field, but, Abby, I know what is in their hearts,\nalways waiting, though they may be unconscious of it themselves.\n\nI have a place where I buy very nice homemade biscuits, sweet crackers,\netc. Among others, one of my ways is to get a good lot of these, and, for\nsupper, go through a couple of wards and give a portion to each man--next\nday two wards more, and so on. Then each marked case needs something to\nitself. I spend my evenings altogether at the hospitals--my days often. I\ngive little gifts of money in small sums, which I am enabled to do--all\nsorts of things indeed, food, clothing, letter-stamps (I write lots of\nletters), now and then a good pair of crutches, etc., etc. Then I read to\nthe boys. The whole ward that can walk gathers around me and listens.\n\nAll this I tell you, my dear, because I know it will interest you. I like\nWashington very well. (Did you see my last letter in the New York _Times_\nof October 4th, Sunday?) I have three or four hours' work every day\ncopying, and in writing letters for the press, etc.; make enough to pay my\nway--live in an inexpensive manner anyhow. I like the mission I am on\nhere, and as it deeply holds me I shall continue.\n\n_October 15._ Well, Abby, I guess I send you letter enough. I ought to\nhave finished and sent off the letter last Sunday, when it was written. I\nhave been pretty busy. We are having new arrivals of wounded and sick now\nall the time--some very bad cases. Abby, should you come across any one\nwho feels to help contribute to the men through me, write me. (I may then\nsend word some purchases I should find acceptable for the men). But this\nonly if it happens to come in that you know or meet any one, perfectly\nconvenient. Abby, I have found some good friends here, a few, but true as\nsteel--W. D. O'Connor and wife above all. He is a clerk in the\nTreasury--she is a Yankee girl. Then C. W. Eldridge[21] in Paymaster's\nDepartment. He is a Boston boy, too--their friendship has been unswerving.\n\nIn the hospitals, among these American young men, I could not describe to\nyou what mutual attachments, and how passing deep and tender these boys.\nSome have died, but the love for them lives as long as I draw breath.\nThese soldiers know how to love too, when once they have the right person\nand the right love offered them. It is wonderful. You see I am running off\ninto the clouds, but this is my element. Abby, I am writing this note this\nafternoon in Major H's office--he is away sick--I am here a good deal of\nthe time alone. It is a dark rainy afternoon--we don't know what is going\non down in front, whether Meade is getting the worst of it or not--(but\nthe result of the big elections cheers us). I believe fully in\nLincoln--few know the rocks and quicksands he has to steer through. I\nenclose you a note Mrs. O'C. handed me to send you--written, I suppose,\nupon impulse. She is a noble Massachusetts woman, is not very rugged in\nhealth--I am there very much--her husband and I are great friends too.\nWell, I will close--the rain is pouring, the sky leaden, it is between 2\nand 3. I am going to get some dinner, and then to the hospital. Good-bye,\ndear friends, and I send my love to all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXVII\n\n_Washington, Oct. 13, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Nothing particular new with\nme. I am well and hearty--think a good deal about home. Mother, I so much\nwant to see you, even if only for a couple of weeks, for I feel I must\nreturn here and continue my hospital operations. They are so much needed,\nalthough one can do only such a little in comparison, amid these\nthousands. Then I desire much to see Andrew. I wonder if I could cheer him\nup any. Does he get any good from that treatment with the baths, etc.?\nMother, I suppose you have your hands full with Nancy's poor little\nchildren, and one worry and another (when one gets old little things\nbother a great deal). Mother, I go down every day looking for a letter\nfrom you or Jeff--I had two from Jeff latter part of the week. I want to\nsee Jeff much. I wonder why he didn't send me the _Union_ with my letter\nin; I am disappointed at not getting it. I sent Han a N. Y. _Times_ with\nmy last letter, and one to George too. Have you heard anything from George\nor Han? There is a new lot of wounded now again. They have been arriving\nsick and wounded for three days--first long strings of ambulances with the\nsick, but yesterday many with bad and bloody wounds, poor fellows. I\nthought I was cooler and more used to it, but the sight of some of them\nbrought tears into my eyes. Mother, I had the good luck yesterday to do\nquite a great deal of good. I had provided a lot of nourishing things for\nthe men, but for another quarter--but I had them where I could use them\nimmediately for these new wounded as they came in faint and hungry, and\nfagged out with a long rough journey, all dirty and torn, and many pale\nas ashes and all bloody. I distributed all my stores, gave partly to the\nnurses I knew that were just taking charge of them--and as many as I could\nI fed myself. Then besides I found a lot of oyster soup handy, and I\nprocured it all at once. Mother, it is the most pitiful sight, I think,\nwhen first the men are brought in. I have to bustle round, to keep from\ncrying--they are such rugged young men--all these just arrived are cavalry\nmen. Our troops got the worst of it, but fought like devils. Our men\nengaged were Kilpatrick's Cavalry. They were in the rear as part of\nMeade's retreat, and the Reb cavalry cut in between and cut them off and\nattacked them and shelled them terribly. But Kilpatrick brought them out\nmostly--this was last Sunday.\n\nMother, I will try to come home before long, if only for six or eight\ndays. I wish to see you, and Andrew--I wish to see the young ones; and\nMat, you must write. I am about moving. I have been hunting for a room\nto-day--I shall [write] next [time] how I succeed. Good-bye for present,\ndear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n_Washington, Oct. 20, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I got your last letter Sunday\nmorning, though it was dated Thursday night. Mother, I suppose you got a\nletter from me Saturday last, as I sent one the day before, as I was\nconcerned about Andrew. If I thought it would be any benefit to Andrew I\nshould certainly leave everything else and come back to Brooklyn. Mother,\ndo you recollect what I wrote last summer about throat diseases, when\nAndrew was first pretty bad? Well, that's the whole groundwork of the\nbusiness; any true physician would confirm it. There is no great charm\nabout such things; as to any costly and mysterious baths, there are no\nbetter baths than warm water, or vapor (and perhaps sulphur vapor). There\nis nothing costly or difficult about them; one can have a very good\nsweating bath, at a pinch, by having a pan of warm water under a chair\nwith a couple of blankets around him to enclose the vapor, and heating a\ncouple of bricks or stones or anything to put in one after another, and\nsitting on the chair--it is a very wholesome sweat, too, and not to be\nsneezed at if one wishes to do what is salutary, and thinks of the sense\nof a thing, and not what others do. Andrew mustn't be discouraged; those\ndiseases are painful and tedious, but he can recover, and will yet. Dear\nmother, I sent your last letter to George, with a short one I wrote\nmyself. I sent it yesterday. I sent a letter last Wednesday (14th) to him\nalso, hoping that if one don't reach him another will. Hasn't Jeff seen\nCapt. Sims or Lieut. McReady yet, and don't they hear whether the 51st is\nnear Nicholasville, Kentucky, yet? I send George papers now and then.\nMother, one of your letters contains part of my letter to the _Union_ (I\nwish I could have got the whole of it). It seems to me mostly as I\nintended it, barring a few slight misprints. Was my last name signed at\nthe bottom of it? Tell me when you write next. Dear mother, I am real\nsorry, and mad too, that the water works people have cut Jeff's wages down\nto $50; this is a pretty time to cut a man's wages down, the mean old\npunkin heads. Mother, I can't understand it at all; tell me more of the\nparticulars. Jeff, I often wish you was on here; you would be better\nappreciated--there are big salaries paid here sometimes to civil\nengineers. Jeff, I know a fellow, E. C. Stedman; has been here till\nlately; is now in Wall street. He is poor, but he is in with the big\nbankers, Hallett & Co., who are in with Fremont in his line of Pacific\nrailroad. I can get his (Stedman's) address, and should you wish it any\ntime I will give you a letter to him. I shouldn't wonder if the big men,\nwith Fremont at head, were going to push their route works, road, etc.,\netc., in earnest, and if a fellow could get a good managing place in it,\nwhy it might be worth while. I think after Jeff has been with the Brooklyn\nw[ater] w[orks] from the beginning, and so faithful and so really\nvaluable, to put down to $50--the mean, low-lived old shoats! I have felt\nas indignant about it, the meanness of the thing, and mighty inconvenient,\ntoo--$40 a month makes a big difference. Mother, I hope Jeff won't get and\nkeep himself in a perpetual fever, with all these things and others and\nbotherations, both family and business ones. If he does, he will just wear\nhimself down before his time comes. I do hope, Jeff, you will take things\nequally all round, and not brood or think too deeply. So I go on giving\nyou all good advice. O mother, I must tell you how I get along in my new\nquarters. I have moved to a new room, 456 Sixth street, not far from\nPennsylvania avenue (the big street here), and not far from the Capitol.\nIt is in the 3d story, an addition back; seems to be going to prove a very\ngood winter room, as it is right under the roof and looks south; has low\nwindows, is plenty big enough; I have gas. I think the lady will prove a\ngood woman. She is old and feeble. (There is a little girl of 4 or 5; I\nhear her sometimes calling _Grandma, Grandma_, just exactly like Hat; it\nmade me think of you and Hat right away.) One thing is I am quite by\nmyself; there is no passage up there except to my room, and right off\nagainst my side of the house is a great old yard with grass and some trees\nback, and the sun shines in all day, etc., and it smells sweet, and good\nair--good big bed; I sleep first rate. There is a young wench of 12 or 13,\nLucy (the niggers here are the best and most amusing creatures you ever\nsee)--she comes and goes, gets water, etc. She is pretty much the only one\nI see. Then I believe the front door is not locked at all at night. (In\nthe other place the old thief, the landlord, had two front doors, with\nfour locks and bolts on one and three on the other--and a big bulldog in\nthe back yard. We were well fortified, I tell you. Sometimes I had an\nawful time at night getting in.) I pay $10 a month; this includes gas, but\nnot fuel. Jeff, you can come on and see me easy now. Mother, to give you\nan idea of prices here, while I was looking for rooms, about like our two\nin Wheeler's houses (2nd story), nothing extra about them, either in\nlocation or anything, and the rent was $60 a month. Yet, quite curious,\nvacant houses here are not so very dear; very much the same as in\nBrooklyn. Dear mother, Jeff wrote in his letter latter part of last week,\nyou was real unwell with a very bad cold (and that you didn't have enough\ngood meals). Mother, I hope this will find you well and in good spirits. I\nthink about you every day and night. Jeff thinks you show your age more,\nand failing like. O my dear mother, you must not think of failing yet. I\nhope we shall have some comfortable years yet. Mother, don't allow things,\ntroubles, to take hold of you; write a few lines whenever you can; tell me\nexactly how things are. Mother, I am first rate and well--only a little of\nthat deafness again. Good-bye for present.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXIX\n\n_Washington, Oct. 27, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER,--Yours and George's letter\ncame, and a letter from Jeff too--all good. I had received a letter a day\nor so before from George too. I am very glad he is at Camp Nelson,\nKentucky, and I hope and pray the reg't will be kept there--for God knows\nthey have tramped enough for the last two years, and fought battles and\nbeen through enough. I have sent George papers to Camp Nelson, and will\nwrite to-morrow. I send him the _Unions_ and the late New York papers.\nMother, you or Jeff write and tell me how Andrew is; I hope he will prove\nto be better. Such complaints are sometimes very alarming for awhile, and\nthen take such a turn for the better. Common means and steadily pursuing\nthem, about diet especially, are so much more reliable than any course of\nmedicine whatever. Mother, I have written to Han; I sent her George's\nletter to me, and wrote her a short letter myself. I sent it four or five\ndays ago. Mother, I am real pleased to hear Jeff's explanation how it is\nthat his wages is cut down, and that it was not as I fancied from the\nmeanness of the old coons in the board. I felt so indignant about it, as I\ntook it into my head, (though I don't know why) that it was done out of\nmeanness, and was a sort of insult. I was quite glad Jeff wrote a few\nlines about it--and glad they appreciate Jeff, too. Mother, if any of my\nsoldier boys should ever call upon you (as they are often anxious to have\nmy address in Brooklyn) you just use them as you know how to without\nceremony, and if you happen to have pot luck and feel to ask them to take\na bite, don't be afraid to do so. There is one very good boy, Thos. Neat,\n2nd N. Y. Cavalry, wounded in leg. He is now home on furlough--his folks\nlive, I think, in Jamaica. He is a noble boy. He may call upon you. (I\ngave him here $1 toward buying his crutches, etc.) I like him very much.\nThen possibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks from Western New York,\nmay call--he had a son died here, a very fine boy. I was with him a good\ndeal, and the old man and his wife have written me, and asked me my\naddress in Brooklyn. He said he had children in N. Y. city and was\noccasionally down there. Mother, when I come home I will show you some of\nthe letters I get from mothers, sisters, fathers, etc.--they will make you\ncry. There is nothing new with my hospital doings--I was there yesterday\nafternoon and evening, and shall be there again to-day. Mother, I should\nlike to hear how you are yourself--has your cold left you, and do you feel\nbetter? Do you feel quite well again? I suppose you have your good stove\nall fired up these days--we have had some real cool weather here. I must\nrake up a little cheap second-hand stove for my room, for it was in the\nbargain that I should get that myself. Mother, I like my place quite well,\nbetter on nearly every account than my old room, but I see it will only do\nfor a winter room. They keep it clean, and the house smells clean, and the\nroom too. My old room, they just let everything lay where it was, and you\ncan fancy what a litter of dirt there was--still it was a splendid room\nfor air, for summer, as good as there is in Washington. I got a letter\nfrom Mrs. Price this morning--does Emmy ever come to see you?\n\nMatty, my dear sister, and Miss Mannahatta, and the little one (whose name\nI don't know, and perhaps hasn't got any name yet), I hope you are all\nwell and having good times. I often, often think about you all. Mat, do\nyou go any to the Opera now? They say the new singers are so good--when I\ncome home we'll try to go. Mother, I am very well--have some cold in my\nhead and my ears stopt up yet, making me sometimes quite hard of hearing.\nI am writing this in Major Hapgood's office. Last Sunday I took dinner at\nmy friends the O'Connors--had two roast chickens, stewed tomatoes,\npotatoes, etc. I took dinner there previous Sunday also.\n\nWell, dear mother, how the time passes away--to think it will soon be a\nyear I have been away! It has passed away very swiftly, somehow, to me. O\nwhat things I have witnessed during that time--I shall never forget them.\nAnd the war is not settled yet, and one does not see anything at all\ncertain about the settlement yet; but I have finally got for good, I\nthink, into the feeling that our triumph is assured, whether it be sooner\nor whether it be later, or whatever roundabout way we are led there, and I\nfind I don't change that conviction from any reverses we meet, or any\ndelays or Government blunders. There are blunders enough, heaven knows,\nbut I am thankful things have gone on as well for us as they\nhave--thankful the ship rides safe and sound at all. Then I have finally\nmade up my mind that Mr. Lincoln has done as good as a human man could do.\nI still think him a pretty big President. I realize here in Washington\nthat it has been a big thing to have just kept the United States from\nbeing thrown down and having its throat cut; and now I have no doubt it\nwill throw down Secession and cut its throat--and I have not had any doubt\nsince Gettysburg. Well, dear, dear mother, I will draw to a close. Andrew\nand Jeff and all, I send you my love. Good-bye, dear mother and dear Matty\nand all hands.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXX\n\n_Washington, Dec. 15, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--The last word I got from home\nwas your letter written the night before Andrew was buried--Friday night,\nnearly a fortnight ago. I have not heard anything since from you or Jeff.\nMother, Major Hapgood has moved from his office, cor. 15th street, and I\nam not with him any more. He has moved his office to his private room. I\nam writing this in my room, 456 Sixth street, but my letters still come to\nMajor's care; they are to be addrest same as ever, as I can easily go and\nget them out of his box (only nothing need be sent me any time to the old\noffice, as I am not there, nor Major either). Anything like a telegraphic\ndispatch or express box or the like should be addrest 456 Sixth street,\n3rd story, back room. Dear mother, I hope you are well and in good\nspirits. I wish you would try to write to me everything about home and the\nparticulars of Andrew's funeral, and how you all are getting along. I have\nnot received the _Eagle_ with the little piece in. I was in hopes Jeff\nwould have sent it. I wish he would yet, or some of you would; I want to\nsee it. I think it must have been put in by a young man named Howard; he\nis now editor of the _Eagle_, and is very friendly to me.\n\nMother, I am quite well. I have been out this morning early, went down\nthrough the market; it is quite a curiosity--I bought some butter, tea,\netc. I have had my breakfast here in my room, good tea, bread and butter,\netc.\n\nMother, I think about you all more than ever--and poor Andrew, I often\nthink about him. Mother, write to me how Nancy and the little boys are\ngetting along. I got thinking last night about little California.[22] O\nhow I wished I had her here for an hour to take care of--dear little girl.\nI don't think I ever saw a young one I took to so much--but I mustn't\nslight Hattie; I like her too. Mother, I am still going among the\nhospitals; there is plenty of need, just the same as ever. I go every day\nor evening. I have not heard from George--I have no doubt the 51st is\nstill at Crab Orchard.\n\nMother, I hope you will try to write. I send you my love, and to Jeff and\nMat and all--so good-bye, dear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\n\n\nLETTERS OF 1864\n\n\nI\n\n_Washington, Friday afternoon, Jan. 29. '64._ DEAR MOTHER--Your letter of\nTuesday night came this forenoon--the one of Sunday night I received\nyesterday. Mother, you don't say in either of them whether George has\nre-enlisted or not--or is that not yet decided positively one way or the\nother?\n\nO mother, how I should like to be home (I don't want more than two or\nthree days). I want to see George (I have his photograph on the wall,\nright over my table all the time), and I want to see California--you must\nalways write in your letters how she is. I shall write to Han this\nafternoon or to-morrow morning and tell her probably George will come out\nand see her, and that if he does you will send her word beforehand.\n\nJeff, my dear brother, if there should be the change made in the works,\nand things all overturned, you mustn't mind--I dare say you will pitch\ninto something better. I believe a real overturn in the dead old beaten\ntrack of a man's life, especially a young man's, is always likely to turn\nout best, though it worries one at first dreadfully. Mat, I want to see\nyou most sincerely--they haven't put in anything in the last two or three\nletters about you, but I suppose you are well, my dear sister.\n\nMother, the young man that I took care of, Lewis Brown, is pretty well,\nbut very restless--he is doing well now, but there is a long road before\nhim yet; it is torture for him to be tied so to his cot, this weather; he\nis a very noble young man and has suffered very much. He is a Maryland boy\nand (like the Southerners when they _are_ Union) I think he is as strong\nand resolute a Union boy as there is in the United States. He went out in\na Maryland reg't, but transferred to a N. Y. battery. But I find so many\nnoble men in the ranks I have ceased to wonder at it. I think the soldiers\nfrom the New England States and the Western States are splendid, and the\ncountry parts of N. Y. and Pennsylvania too. I think less of the great\ncities than I used to. I know there are black sheep enough even in the\nranks, but the general rule is the soldiers are noble, very.\n\nMother, I wonder if George thinks as I do about the best way to enjoy a\nvisit home, after all. When I come home again, I shall not go off\ngallivanting with my companions half as much nor a quarter as much as I\nused to, but shall spend the time quietly home with you while I do stay;\nit is a great humbug spreeing around, and a few choice friends for a man,\nthe real right kind in a quiet way, are enough.\n\nMother, I hope you take things easy, don't you? Mother, you know I was\nalways advising you to let things go and sit down and take what comfort\nyou can while you do live. It is very warm here; this afternoon it is\nwarm enough for July--the sun burns where it shines on your face; it is\npretty dusty in the principal streets.\n\nCongress is in session; I see Odell, Kalbfleisch, etc., often. I have got\nacquainted with Mr. Garfield, an M. C. from Ohio, and like him very much\nindeed (he has been a soldier West, and I believe a good brave one--was a\nmajor general). I don't go much to the debates this session yet. Congress\nwill probably keep in session till well into the summer. As to what course\nthings will take, political or military, there's no telling. I think,\nthough, the Secesh military power is getting more and more shaky. How they\ncan make any headway against our new, large, and fresh armies next season\npasses my wit to see.\n\nMother, I was talking with a pretty high officer here, who is behind the\nscenes--I was mentioning that I had a great desire to be present at a\nfirst-class battle; he told me if I would only stay around here three or\nfour weeks longer my wish would probably be gratified. I asked him what he\nmeant, what he alluded to specifically, but he would not say anything\nfurther--so I remain as much in the dark as before--only there seemed to\nbe some meaning in his remark, and it was made to me only as there was no\none else in hearing at the moment (he is quite an admirer of my poetry).\n\nThe re-enlistment of the veterans is the greatest thing yet; it pleases\neverybody but the Rebels--and surprises everybody too. Mother, I am well\nand fat (I must weigh about 206), so Washington must agree with me. I work\nthree or four hours a day copying. Dear mother, I send you and Hattie my\nlove, as you say she is a dear little girl. Mother, try to write every\nweek, even if only a few lines. Love to George and Jeff and Mat.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nII\n\n_Washington, Feb. 2, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I am writing this by the side\nof the young man you asked about, Lewis Brown in Armory-square hospital.\nHe is getting along very well indeed--the amputation is healing up good,\nand he does not suffer anything like as much as he did. I see him every\nday. We have had real hot weather here, and for the last three days wet\nand rainy; it is more like June than February. Mother, I wrote to Han last\nSaturday--she must have got it yesterday. I have not heard anything from\nhome since a week ago (your last letter). I suppose you got a letter from\nme Saturday last. I am well as usual. There has been several hundred sick\nsoldiers brought in here yesterday. I have been around among them to-day\nall day--it is enough to make me heart-sick, the old times over again;\nthey are many of them mere wrecks, though young men (sickness is worse in\nsome respects than wounds). One boy about 16, from Portland, Maine, only\ncame from home a month ago, a recruit; he is here now very sick and\ndown-hearted, poor child. He is a real country boy; I think has\nconsumption. He was only a week with his reg't. I sat with him a long\ntime; I saw [it] did him great good. I have been feeding some their\ndinners. It makes me feel quite proud, I find so frequently I can do with\nthe men what no one else at all can, getting them to eat (some that will\nnot touch their food otherwise, nor for anybody else)--it is sometimes\nquite affecting, I can tell you. I found such a case to-day, a soldier\nwith throat disease, very bad. I fed him quite a dinner; the men, his\ncomrades around, just stared in wonder, and one of them told me afterwards\nthat he (the sick man) had not eat so much at a meal in three months.\nMother, I shall have my hands pretty full now for a while--write all about\nthings home.\n\n    WALT.\n\nLewis Brown says I must give you his love--he says he knows he would like\nyou if he should see you.\n\n\nIII\n\n_Washington, Friday afternoon, Feb. 5, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I am going\ndown in front, in the midst of the army, to-morrow morning, to be gone for\nabout a week--so I thought I would write you a few lines now, to let you\nknow.\n\nMother, I suppose you got my letter written last Tuesday--I have not got\nany from home now for a number of days. I am well and hearty. The young\nman Lewis Brown is able to be up a little on crutches. There is quite a\nnumber of sick young men I have taken in hand, from the late arrivals,\nthat I am sorry to leave. Sick and down-hearted and lonesome, they think\nso much of a friend, and I get so attached to them too--but I want to go\ndown in camp once more very much; and I think I shall be back in a week. I\nshall spend most of my time among the sick and wounded in the camp\nhospitals. If I had means I should stop with them, poor boys, or go among\nthem periodically, dispensing what I had, as long as the war lasts, down\namong the worst of it (although what are collected here in hospital seem\nto me about as severe and needy cases as any, after all).\n\nMother, I want to hear about you all, and about George and how he is\nspending his time home. Mother, I do hope you are well and in good\nspirits, and Jeff and Mat and all, and dear little California and\nHattie--I send them all my love. Mother, I may write to you from down in\nfront--so good-bye, dear mother, for present.\n\n    WALT.\n\nI hope I shall find several letters waiting for me when I get back here.\n\n\nIV\n\n_Culpepper, Virginia, Friday night, Feb. 12, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I am\nstill stopping down in this region. I am a good deal of the time down\nwithin half a mile of our picket lines, so that you see I can indeed call\nmyself in the front. I stopped yesterday with an artillery camp in the 1st\nCorps at the invitation of Capt. Crawford, who said that he knew me in\nBrooklyn. It is close to the lines--I asked him if he did not think it\ndangerous. He said, No, he could have a large force of infantry to help\nhim there, in very short metre, if there was any sudden emergency. The\ntroops here are scattered all around, much more apart than they seemed to\nme to be opposite Fredericksburg last winter. They mostly have good huts\nand fireplaces, etc. I have been to a great many of the camps, and I must\nsay I am astonished [how] good the houses are almost everywhere. I have\nnot seen one regiment, nor any part of one, in the poor uncomfortable\nlittle shelter tents that I saw so common last winter after\nFredericksburg--but all the men have built huts of logs and mud. A good\nmany of them would be comfortable enough to live in under any\ncircumstances. I have been in the division hospitals around here. There\nare not many men sick here, and no wounded--they now send them on to\nWashington. I shall return there in a few days, as I am very clear that\nthe real need of one's services is there after all--there the worst cases\nconcentrate, and probably will, while the war lasts. I suppose you know\nthat what we call hospital here in the field is nothing but a collection\nof tents on the bare ground for a floor--rather hard accommodation for a\nsick man. They heat them there by digging a long trough in the ground\nunder them, covering it over with old railroad iron and earth, and then\nbuilding a fire at one end and letting it draw through and go out at the\nother, as both ends are open. This heats the ground through the middle of\nthe hospital quite hot. I find some poor creatures crawling about pretty\nweak with diarrhoea; there is a great deal of that; they keep them until\nthey get very bad indeed, and then send them to Washington. This\naggravates the complaint, and they come into Washington in a terrible\ncondition. O mother, how often and how many I have seen come into\nWashington from this awful complaint after such an experience as I have\ndescribed--with the look of death on their poor young faces; they keep\nthem so long in the field hospitals with poor accommodations the disease\ngets too deeply seated.\n\nTo-day I have been out among some of the camps of the 2nd division of the\n1st Corps. I have been wandering around all day, and have had a very good\ntime, over woods, hills, and gullies--indeed, a real soldier's march. The\nweather is good and the travelling quite tolerable. I have been in the\ncamps of some Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York regiments. I have\nfriends in them, and went out to see them, and see soldiering generally,\nas I can never cease to crave more and more knowledge of actual soldiers'\nlife, and to be among them as much as possible. This evening I have also\nbeen in a large wagoners' camp. They had good fires and were very\ncheerful. I went to see a friend there, too, but did not find him in. It\nis curious how many I find that I know and that know me. Mother, I have no\ndifficulty at all in making myself at home among the soldiers, teamsters,\nor any--I most always find they like to have me very much; it seems to do\nthem good. No doubt they soon feel that my heart and sympathies are truly\nwith them, and it is both a novelty and pleases them and touches their\nfeelings, and so doubtless does them good--and I am sure it does that to\nme. There is more fun around here than you would think for. I told you\nabout the theatre the 14th Brooklyn has got up--they have songs and\nburlesques, etc.; some of the performers real good. As I write this I have\nheard in one direction or another two or three good bands playing--and\nhear one tooting away some gay tunes now, though it is quite late at\nnight. Mother, I don't know whether I mentioned in my last letter that I\ntook dinner with Col. Fowler one day early part of the week. His wife is\nstopping here. I was down at the 14th as I came along this evening,\ntoo--one of the officers told me about a presentation to George of a\nsword, etc.--he said he see it in the papers. The 14th invited me to come\nand be their guest while I staid here, but I have not been able to\naccept. Col. Fowler uses me tip-top--he is provost marshal of this\nregion; makes a good officer. Mother, I could get no pen and ink to-night.\nWell, dear mother, I send you my love, and to George and Jeff and Mat and\nlittle girls and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\nDirect to care of Major Hapgood as before, and write soon. Mother, I\nsuppose you got a letter I wrote from down here last Monday.\n\n\nV\n\n_Washington, March 2, 1864._ DEAR MOTHER--You or Jeff must try to write as\nsoon as you receive this and let me know how little Sis is. Tell me if she\ngot entirely over the croup and how she is--also about George's trunks. I\ndo hope he received them; it was such a misfortune; I want to hear the end\nof it; I am in hopes I shall hear that he has got them. I have not seen in\nthe papers whether the 51st has left New York yet. Mother, I want to hear\nall about home and all the occurrences, especially the two things I have\njust mentioned, and how you are, for somehow I was thinking from your\nletters lately whether you was as well as usual or not. Write how my dear\nsister Mat is too, and whether you are still going to stay there in\nPortland avenue the coming year. Well, dear mother, I am just the same\nhere--nothing new. I am well and hearty, and constantly moving around\namong the wounded and sick. There are a great many of the latter coming\nup--the hospitals here are quite full--lately they have [been] picking out\nin the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered, and sending them back\nto their regiments. They seem to be determined to strengthen the army this\nspring to the utmost. They are sending down many to their reg'ts that are\nnot fit to go in my opinion--then there are squads and companies, and\nreg'ts, too, passing through here in one steady stream, going down to the\nfront, returning from furlough home; but then there are quite a number\nleaving the army on furlough, re-enlisting, and going North for a while.\nThey pass through here quite largely. Mother, Lewis Brown is getting quite\nwell; he will soon be able to have a wooden leg put on. He is very\nrestless and active, and wants to go round all the time. Sam Beatty is\nhere in Washington. We have had quite a snow storm, but [it] is clear and\nsunny to-day here, but sloshy. I am wearing my army boots--anything but\nthe dust. Dear Mother, I want to see you and Sis and Mat and all very\nmuch. If I can get a chance I think I shall come home for a while. I want\nto try to bring out a book of poems, a new one, to be called \"Drum-Taps,\"\nand I want to come to New York for that purpose, too.\n\nMother, I haven't given up the project of lecturing, either, but whatever\nI do, I shall for the main thing devote myself for years to come to these\nwounded and sick, what little I can. Well, good-bye, dear mother, for\npresent--write soon.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nVI\n\n_Washington, March 15, 1861._ DEAREST MOTHER--I got a letter from Jeff\nlast Sunday--he says you have a very bad cold indeed. Dear Mother, I feel\nvery much concerned about it; I do hope it has passed over before this.\nJeff wrote me about the house. I hope it will be so you can both remain in\nthe same house; it would be much more satisfaction.... The poor boy very\nsick of brain fever I was with, is dead; he was only 19 and a noble boy,\nso good though out of his senses some eight days, though still having a\nkind of idea of things. No relative or friend was with him. It was very\nsad. I was with him considerable, only just sitting by him soothing him.\nHe was wandering all the time. His talk was so affecting it kept the tears\nin my eyes much of the time. The last twenty-four hours he sank very\nrapidly. He had been sick some months ago and was put in the 6th Invalid\nCorps--they ought to have sent him home instead. The next morning after\nhis death his brother came, a very fine man, postmaster at Lyne Ridge,\nPa.--he was much affected, and well he might be.\n\nMother, I think it worse than ever here in the hospitals. We are getting\nthe dregs as it were of the sickness and awful hardships of the past three\nyears. There is the most horrible cases of diarrhoea you ever conceived\nof and by the hundreds and thousands; I suppose from such diet as they\nhave in the army. Well, dear mother, I will not write any more on the\nsick, and yet I know you wish to hear about them. Every one is so\nunfeeling; it has got to be an old story. There is no good nursing. O I\nwish you were--or rather women of such qualities as you and Mat--were here\nin plenty, to be stationed as matrons among the poor sick and wounded men.\nJust to be present would be enough--O what good it would do them. Mother,\nI feel so sick when I see what kind of people there are among them, with\ncharge over them--so cold and ceremonious, afraid to touch them. Well,\nmother, I fear I have written you a flighty kind of a letter--I write in\nhaste.\n\n    WALT.\n\nThe papers came right, mother--love to Jeff, Mat, and all.\n\n\nVII\n\n_Washington, March 22, 1861._ DEAREST MOTHER--I feel quite bad to hear\nthat you are not well--have a pain in your side, and a very bad cold. Dear\nMother, I hope it is better. I wish you would write to me, or Jeff would,\nright away, as I shall not feel easy until I hear. I rec'd George's\nletter. Jeff wrote with it, about your feeling pretty sick, and the pain.\nMother, I also rec'd your letter a few days before. You say the Browns\nacted very mean, and I should say they did indeed, but as it is going to\nremain the same about the house, I should let it all pass. I am very glad\nMat and Jeff are going to remain; I should not have felt satisfied if they\nand you had been separated. I have written a letter to Han, with others\nenclosed, a good long letter (took two postage stamps). I have written to\nGeorge too, directed it to Knoxville. Mother, everything is the same with\nme; I am feeling very well indeed, the old trouble of my head stopt and my\nears affected, has not troubled me any since I came back here from\nBrooklyn. I am writing this in Major Hapgood's old office, cor. 15th and F\nstreets, where I have my old table and window. It is dusty and chilly\nto-day, anything but agreeable. Gen. Grant is expected every moment now in\nthe Army of the Potomac to take active command. I have just this moment\nheard from the front--there is nothing yet of a movement, but each side is\ncontinually on the alert, expecting something to happen. O mother, to\nthink that we are to have here soon what I have seen so many times, the\nawful loads and trains and boat loads of poor bloody and pale and wounded\nyoung men again--for that is what we certainly will, and before very long.\nI see all the little signs, geting ready in the hospitals, etc.; it is\ndreadful when one thinks about it. I sometimes think over the sights I\nhave myself seen, the arrival of the wounded after a battle, and the\nscenes on the field too, and I can hardly believe my own recollections.\nWhat an awful thing war is! Mother, it seems not men but a lot of devils\nand butchers butchering each other.\n\nDear mother, I think twenty times a day about your sickness. O, I hope it\nis not so bad as Jeff wrote. He said you was worse than you had ever been\nbefore, and he would write me again. Well, he must, even if only a few\nlines. What have you heard from Mary and her family, anything? Well, dear\nmother, I hope this will find you quite well of the pain, and of the\ncold--write about the little girls and Mat and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nVIII\n\n_Washington, March 29, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have written to George\nagain to Knoxville. Things seem to be quiet down there so far. We think\nhere that our forces are going to be made strongest here in Virginia this\nspring, and every thing bent to take Richmond. Grant is here; he is now\ndown at headquarters in the field, Brandy station. We expect fighting\nbefore long; there are many indications. I believe I told you they had\nsent up all the sick from front. [_The letter is here mutilated so as to\nbe illegible; from the few remaining words, however, it is possible to\ngather that the writer is describing the arrival of a_ train of wounded,\nover 600, _in Washington during_ a terribly rainy afternoon. _The letter\ncontinues_:] I could not keep the tears out of my eyes. Many of the poor\nyoung men had to be moved on stretchers, with blankets over them, which\nsoon soaked as wet as water in the rain. Most were sick cases, but some\nbadly wounded. I came up to the nearest hospital and helped. Mother, it\nwas a dreadful night (last Friday night)--pretty dark, the wind gusty, and\nthe rain fell in torrents. One poor boy--this is a sample of one case out\nof the 600--he seemed to be quite young, he was quite small (I looked at\nhis body afterwards), he groaned some as the stretcher bearers were\ncarrying him along, and again as they carried him through the hospital\ngate. They set down the stretcher and examined him, and the poor boy was\ndead. They took him into the ward, and the doctor came immediately, but it\nwas all of no use. The worst of it is, too, that he is entirely\nunknown--there was nothing on his clothes, or any one with him to identity\nhim, and he is altogether unknown. Mother, it is enough to rack one's\nheart--such things. Very likely his folks will never know in the world\nwhat has become of him. Poor, poor child, for he appeared as though he\ncould be but 18. I feel lately as though I must have some intermission. I\nfeel well and hearty enough, and was never better, but my feelings are\nkept in a painful condition a great part of the time. Things get worse and\nworse, as to the amount and sufferings of the sick, and as I have said\nbefore, those who have to do with them are getting more and more callous\nand indifferent. Mother, when I see the common soldiers, what they go\nthrough, and how everybody seems to try to pick upon them, and what\nhumbug there is over them every how, even the dying soldier's money stolen\nfrom his body by some scoundrel attendant, or from [the] sick one, even\nfrom under his head, which is a common thing, and then the agony I see\nevery day, I get almost frightened at the world. Mother, I will try to\nwrite more cheerfully next time--but I see so much. Well, good-bye for\npresent, dear mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nIX\n\n_Washington, Thursday afternoon, March 31, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have\njust this moment received your letter dated last Monday evening. Dear\nmother, I have not seen anything in any paper where the 51st is, nor heard\nanything, but I do not feel any ways uneasy about them. I presume they are\nat Knoxville, Tennessee. Mother, they are now paying off many of the\nregiments in this army--but about George, I suppose there will be delays\nin sending money, etc. Dear mother, I wish I had some money to send you,\nbut I am living very close by the wind. Mother, I will try somehow to send\nyou something worth while, and I do hope you will not worry and feel\nunhappy about money matters; I know things are very high. Mother, I\nsuppose you got my letter written Tuesday last, 29th March, did you not? I\nhave been going to write to Jeff for more than a month--I laid out to\nwrite a good long letter, but something has prevented me, one thing and\nanother; but I will try to write to-morrow sure. Mother, I have been in\nthe midst of suffering and death for two months worse than ever--the only\ncomfort is that I have been the cause of some beams of sunshine upon their\nsuffering and gloomy souls, and bodies too. Many of the dying I have been\nwith, too.\n\nWell, mother, you must not worry about the grocery bill, etc., though I\nsuppose you will say that it is easier said than followed (as to me, I\nbelieve I worry about worldly things less than ever, if that is possible).\nTell Jeff and Mat I send them my love. Gen. Grant has just come in town\nfrom front. The country here is all mad again. I am going to a\nspiritualist medium this evening--I expect it will be a humbug, of course.\nI will tell you next letter. Dear mother, keep a good heart.\n\n    WALT.\n\nHow is California? Tell Hat her Uncle Walt will come home one of these\ndays, and take her to New York to walk in Broadway. Poor little Jim, I\nshould like to see him. There is a rich young friend of mine wants me to\ngo to Idaho with him to make money.\n\n\nX\n\n_Washington, Tuesday afternoon, April 5, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I got a\nletter from Jeff yesterday--he says you often work too hard, exposing\nyourself; I suppose, scrubbing, etc., and the worst of it is I am afraid\nit is true. Mother, I would take things easy, and let up on the scrubbing\nand such things; they may be needed perhaps, but they ain't half as much\nneeded as that you should be as well as possible, and free from rheumatism\nand cold. Jeff says that ---- has had the chicken pox. Has she got all\nover it? I want to hear. So Nance has had another child, poor little one;\nthere don't seem to be much show for it, poor little young one, these\ntimes. We are having awful rainy weather here. It is raining to-day steady\nand spiteful enough. The soldiers in camp are having the benefit of it,\nand the sick, many of them. There is a great deal of rheumatism and also\nthroat disease, and they are affected by the weather. I have writ to\nGeorge again, directed to Knoxville. Mother, I got a letter this morning\nfrom Lewis Brown, the young man that had his leg amputated two months or\nso ago (the one that I slept in the hospital by several nights for fear of\nhemorrhage from the amputation). He is home at Elkton, Maryland, on\nfurlough. He wants me to come out there, but I believe I shall not go--he\nis doing very well. There are many very bad now in hospital, so many of\nthe soldiers are getting broke down after two years, or two and a half,\nexposure and bad diet, pork, hard biscuit, bad water or none at all, etc.,\netc.--so we have them brought up here. Oh, it is terrible, and getting\nworse, worse, worse. I thought it was bad; to see these I sometimes think\nis more pitiful still.\n\nWell, mother, I went to see the great spirit medium, Foster. There were\nsome little things some might call curious, perhaps, but it is a shallow\nthing and a humbug. A gentleman who was with me was somewhat impressed,\nbut I could not see anything in it worth calling supernatural. I wouldn't\nturn on my heel to go again and see such things, or twice as much. We had\ntable rappings and lots of nonsense. I will give you particulars when I\ncome home one of these days. Jeff, I believe there is a fate on your long\nletter; I thought I would write it to-day, but as it happens I will hardly\nget this in the mail, I fear, in time for to-day. O how I want to see you\nall, and Sis and Hat. Well, I have scratched out a great letter just as\nfast as I could write.\n\n_Wednesday forenoon._ Mother, I didn't get the letter in the mail\nyesterday. I have just had my breakfast, some good tea and good toast and\nbutter. I write this in my room, 456 Sixth st. The storm seems to be over.\nDear mother, I hope you are well and in good spirits--write to me often as\nyou can, and Jeff too. Any news from Han?\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXI\n\n_Washington, April 10, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I rec'd your letter and sent\nthe one you sent for George immediately--he must have got it the next day.\nI had got one from him before yours arrived. I mean to go to Annapolis\nand see him.\n\nMother, we expect a commencement of the fighting below very soon; there is\nevery indication of it. We have had about as severe rain storms here\nlately as I ever see. It is middling pleasant now. There are exciting\ntimes in Congress--the Copperheads are getting furious and want to\nrecognize the Southern Confederacy. This is a pretty time to talk of\nrecognizing such villains after what they have done, and after what has\ntranspired the last three years. After first Fredericksburg I felt\ndiscouraged myself, and doubted whether our rulers could carry on the\nwar--but that has passed away. The war must be carried on, and I could\nwillingly go myself in the ranks if I thought it would profit more than at\npresent, and I don't know sometimes but I shall as it is. Mother, you\ndon't know what a feeling a man gets after being in the active sights and\ninfluences of the camp, the army, the wounded, etc. He gets to have a deep\nfeeling he never experienced before--the flag, the tune of Yankee Doodle\nand similar things, produce an effect on a fellow never such before. I\nhave seen some bring tears on the men's cheeks, and others turn pale,\nunder such circumstances. I have a little flag; it belonged to one of our\ncavalry reg'ts; presented to me by one of the wounded. It was taken by the\nSecesh in a cavalry fight, and rescued by our men in a bloody little\nskirmish. It cost three men's lives, just to get one little flag, four by\nthree. Our men rescued it, and tore it from the breast of a dead\nRebel--all that just for the name of getting their little banner back\nagain. The man that got it was very badly wounded, and they let him keep\nit. I was with him a good deal; he wanted to give me something, he said,\nhe didn't expect to live, so he gave me the little banner as a keepsake. I\nmention this, mother, to show you a specimen of the feeling. There isn't a\nreg't, cavalry or infantry, that wouldn't do the same on occasion.\n\n_Tuesday morning, April 12._ Mother, I will finish my letter this morning.\nIt is a beautiful day to-day. I was up in Congress very late last night.\nThe house had a very excited night session about expelling the men that\nwant to recognize the Southern Confederacy. You ought to hear the soldiers\ntalk. They are excited to madness. We shall probably have hot times here,\nnot in the army alone. The soldiers are true as the North Star. I send you\na couple of envelopes, and one to George. Write how you are, dear mother,\nand all the rest. I want to see you all. Jeff, my dear brother, I wish you\nwas here, and Mat too. Write how Sis is. I am well, as usual; indeed first\nrate every way. I want to come on in a month and try to print my\n\"Drum-Taps.\" I think it may be a success pecuniarily, too. Dearest mother,\nI hope this will find you entirely well, and dear sister Mat and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXII\n\n_Washington, Tuesday noon, April 19, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I haven't\nheard any news from home now in more than a week. I hope you are well,\ndear mother, and all the rest too. There is nothing new with me. I can\nonly write the same old story about going to the hospitals, etc., etc. I\nhave not heard anything since from George--have you heard anything\nfurther? I have written to him to Annapolis. We are having it pretty warm\nhere to-day, after a long spell of rain storms, but the last two or three\ndays very fine. Mother, I suppose you got my letter of last Tuesday, 12th.\nI went down to the Capitol the nights of the debate on the expulsion of\nMr. Long last week. They had night sessions, very late. I like to go to\nthe House of Representatives at night; it is the most magnificent hall, so\nrich and large, and lighter at night than it is days, and still not a\nlight visible--it comes through the glass roof--but the speaking and the\nability of the members is nearly always on a low scale. It is very curious\nand melancholy to see such a rate of talent there, such tremendous times\nas these--I should say about the same range of genius as our old friend\nDr. Swaim, just about. You may think I am joking, but I am not, mother--I\nam speaking in perfect earnest. The Capitol grows upon one in time,\nespecially as they have got the great figure on top of it now, and you can\nsee it very well. It is a great bronze figure, the Genius of Liberty I\nsuppose. It looks wonderful towards sundown. I love to go and look at it.\nThe sun when it is nearly down shines on the headpiece and it dazzles and\nglistens like a big star; it looks quite curious.\n\nWell, mother, we have commenced on another summer, and what it will bring\nforth who can tell? The campaign of this summer is expected here to be\nmore active and severe than any yet. As I told you in a former letter,\nGrant is determined to bend everything to take Richmond and break up the\nbanditti of scoundrels that have stuck themselves up there as a\n\"government.\" He is in earnest about it; his whole soul and all his\nthoughts night and day are upon it. He is probably the most in earnest of\nany man in command or in the Government either--that's something, ain't\nit, mother?--and they are bending everything to fight for their last\nchance--calling in their forces from Southwest, etc. Dear mother, give my\nlove to dear brother Jeff and Mat and all. I write this in my room, 6th\nst.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXIII\n\n_Washington, April 26, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--Burnside's army passed\nthrough here yesterday. I saw George and walked with him in the regiment\nfor some distance and had quite a talk. He is very well; he is very much\ntanned and looks hardy. I told him all the latest news from home. George\nstands it very well, and looks and behaves the same noble and good fellow\nhe always was and always will be. It was on 14th st. I watched three hours\nbefore the 51st came along. I joined him just before they came to where\nthe President and Gen. Burnside were standing with others on a balcony,\nand the interest of seeing me, etc., made George forget to notice the\nPresident and salute him. He was a little annoyed at forgetting it. I\ncalled his attention to it, but we had passed a little too far on, and\nGeorge wouldn't turn round even ever so little. However, there was a great\nmany more than half the army passed without noticing Mr. Lincoln and the\nothers, for there was a great crowd all through the streets, especially\nhere, and the place where the President stood was not conspicuous from the\nrest. The 9th Corps made a very fine show indeed. There were, I should\nthink, five very full regiments of new black troops, under Gen. Ferrero.\nThey looked and marched very well. It looked funny to see the President\nstanding with his hat off to them just the same as the rest as they passed\nby. Then there [were the] Michigan regiments; one of them was a regiment\nof sharpshooters, partly composed of Indians. Then there was a pretty\nstrong force of artillery and a middling force of cavalry--many New York,\nPennsylvania, Massachusetts, R. I., etc., reg'ts. All except the blacks\nwere veterans [that had] seen plenty of fighting. Mother, it is very\ndifferent to see a real army of fighting men, from one of those shows in\nBrooklyn, or New York, or on Fort Greene. Mother, it was a curious sight\nto see these ranks after rank of our own dearest blood of men, mostly\nyoung, march by, worn and sunburnt and sweaty, with well-worn clothes and\nthin bundles, and knapsacks, tin cups, and some with frying pans strapt\nover their backs, all dirty and sweaty, nothing real neat about them\nexcept their muskets; but they were all as clean and bright as silver.\nThey were four or five hours passing along, marching with wide ranks\npretty quickly, too. It is a great sight to see an army 25 or 30,000 on\nthe march. They are all so gay, too. Poor fellows, nothing dampens their\nspirits. They all got soaked with rain the night before. I saw Fred\nMcReady and Capt. Sims, and Col. Le Gendre, etc. I don't know exactly\nwhere Burnside's army is going. Among other rumors it is said they [are]\nto go [with] the Army of the Potomac to act as a reserve force, etc.\nAnother is that they are to make a flank march, to go round and get Lee on\nthe side, etc. I haven't been out this morning and don't know what\nnews--we know nothing, only that there is without doubt to be a terrible\ncampaign here in Virginia this summer, and that all who know deepest about\nit are very serious about it. Mother, it is serious times. I do not feel\nto fret or whimper, but in my heart and soul about our country, the\nforthcoming campaign with all its vicissitudes and the wounded and\nslain--I dare say, mother, I feel the reality more than some because I am\nin the midst of its saddest results so much. Others may say what they\nlike, I believe in Grant and in Lincoln, too. I think Grant deserves to be\ntrusted. He is working continually. No one knows his plans; we will only\nknow them when he puts them in operation. Our army is very large here in\nVirginia this spring, and they are still pouring in from east and west.\nYou don't see about it in the papers, but we have a very large army here.\n\nMother, I am first rate in health, thank God; I never was better. Dear\nmother, have you got over all that distress and sickness in your head? You\nmust write particular about it. Dear brother Jeff, how are you, and how is\nMatty, and how the dear little girls? Jeff, I believe the devil is in it\nabout my writing you; I have laid out so many weeks to write you a good\nlong letter, and something has shoved it off each time. Never mind,\nmother's letters keep you posted. You must write, and don't forget to tell\nme all about Sis. Is she as good and interesting as she was six months\nago? Mother, have you heard anything from Han? Mother, I have just had my\nbreakfast. I had it in my room--some hard biscuit warmed on the stove, and\na bowl of strong tea with good milk and sugar. I have given a Michigan\nsoldier his breakfast with me. He relished it, too; he has just gone.\nMother, I have just heard again that Burnside's troops are to be a reserve\nto protect Washington, so there may be something in it.\n\n    WALT.\n\nIt is very fine weather here yesterday and to-day. The hospitals are very\nfull; they are putting up hundreds of hospital tents.\n\n\nXIV\n\n_Washington, April 28, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I thought I would write you\njust a line, though I have nothing of importance--only the talk of the\nstreet here seems more and more to assert that Burnside's army is to\nremain near here to protect Washington and act as a reserve, so that Grant\ncan move the Army of the Potomac upon Richmond, without being compelled to\nturn and be anxious about the Capital; also that Burnside can attend to\nLee if the latter should send any force up west of here (what they call\nthe valley of the Shenandoah), or invade Pennsylvania again. I thought you\nwould like to hear this; it looks plausible, but there are lots of rumors\nof all kinds. I cannot hear where Burnside's army is, as they don't allow\nthe papers to print army movements, but I fancy they are very near\nWashington, the other side of Arlington heights, this moment. Mother, I\nwrote yesterday to Han, and sent one of George's letters from Annapolis.\nMother, I suppose you got my letter of Tuesday, 26th. I have not heard\nanything from you in quite a little while. I am still well. The weather is\nfine; quite hot yesterday. Mother, I am now going down to see a poor\nsoldier who is very low with a long diarrhoea--he cannot recover. When\nI was with him last night, he asked me before I went away to ask God's\nblessing on him. He says, I am no scholar and you are--poor dying man, I\ntold him I hoped from the bottom of my heart God would bless him, and\nbring him up yet. I soothed him as well as I could; it was affecting, I\ncan tell you. Jeff, I wrote to Mr. Kirkwood yesterday to 44 Pierrepont st.\nHe sent me some money last Monday. Is Probasco still in the store in\nN. Y.? Dear sister Mat, I quite want to see you and California, not\nforgetting my little Hattie, too.\n\n    WALT.\n\n_2 o'clock, 28th April._ DEAREST MOTHER--Just as I was going to mail this\nI received authentic information [that] Burnside's army is now about 16 or\n18 miles south of here, at a place called Fairfax Court House. They had\nlast night no orders to move at present, and I rather think they will\nremain there, or near there. What I have written before as a rumor about\ntheir being to be held as a reserve, to act whenever occasion may need\nthem, is now quite decided on. You may hear a rumor in New York that they\nhave been shipped in transports from Alexandria--there is no truth in it\nat all. Grant's Army of the Potomac is probably to do the heavy work. His\narmy is strong and full of fight. Mother, I think it is to-day the noblest\narmy of soldiers that ever marched--nobody can know the men as well as I\ndo, I sometimes think.\n\nMother, I am writing this in Willard's hotel, on my way down to hospital\nafter I leave this at post office. I shall come out to dinner at 4 o'clock\nand then go back to hospital again in evening.\n\nGood bye, dear mother and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXV\n\n_Washington, May 3, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I received your letter dated\nlast Friday afternoon, with one from Mr. Heyde. It seems by that Han is\nbetter, but, as you say, it would be much more satisfactory if Han would\nwrite to us herself. Mother, I believe I told you I sent a letter to Han\nlast week, enclosing one of George's from Annapolis. I was glad to get\nHeyde's letter, though, as it was. Mother, I am sorry you still have\nreturns of your cold. Does it affect your head like it did? Dear mother, I\nhope you will not expose yourself, nor work too much, but take things\neasier. I have nothing different to write about the war, or movements\nhere. What I wrote last Thursday, about Burnside's Corps being probably\nused as a reserve, is still talked of here, and seems to be probable. A\nlarge force is necessary to guard the railroad between here and Culpepper,\nand also to keep from any emergency that might happen, and I shouldn't\nwonder if the 9th would be used for such purpose, at least for the\npresent. I think the 51st must be down not very far from Fairfax Court\nHouse yet, but I haven't heard certain.\n\nMother, I have seen a person up from front this morning. There is no\nmovement yet and no fighting started. The men are in their camps yet. Gen.\nGrant is at Culpepper. You need not pay the slightest attention to such\nthings as you mention in the _Eagle_, about the 9th Corps--the writer of\nit, and very many of the writers on war matters in those papers, don't\nknow one bit more on what they are writing about than Ed does. Mother, you\nsay in your letter you got my letter the previous afternoon. Why, mother,\nyou ought to [have] got it Wednesday forenoon, or afternoon at furthest.\nThis letter now will get in New York Wednesday morning, by daylight--you\nought to get it before noon. The postmaster in Brooklyn must have a pretty\nset of carriers, to take twice as long to take a letter from New York to\nyou as it does to go from Washington to N. Y. Mother, I suppose you got a\nletter from me Friday, also, as I wrote a second letter on Thursday last,\ntelling you the 9th Corps was camped then about sixteen miles from here.\n\nAbout George's pictures, perhaps you better wait till I hear from him,\nbefore sending them. I remain well as usual. The poor fellow I mentioned\nin one of my letters last week, with diarrhoea, that wanted me to ask\nGod's blessing on him, was still living yesterday afternoon, but just\nliving. He is only partially conscious, is all wasted away to nothing, and\nlies most of the time in half stupor, as they give him brandy copiously.\nYesterday I was there by him a few minutes. He is very much averse to\ntaking brandy, and there was some trouble in getting him to take it. He is\nalmost totally deaf the last five or six days. There is no chance for him\nat all. Quite a particular friend of mine, Oscar Cunningham, an Ohio boy,\nhad his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh. It was a pretty\ntough operation. He was badly wounded just a year ago to-day at\nChancellorsville and has suffered a great deal; lately got erysipelas in\nhis leg and foot. I forget whether I have mentioned him before or not. He\nwas a very large, noble-looking young man when I first see him. The doctor\nthinks he will live and get up, but I consider [it] by no means so\ncertain. He is very much prostrated. Well, dear mother, you must write and\nJeff too--I do want to see you all very much. How does Mat get along, and\nhow little Sis and all? I send my love to you and Jeff and all. We are\nhaving a very pleasant, coolish day here. I am going down to post office\nto leave this, and then up to my old friends the O'Connors to dinner, and\nthen down to hospital. Well, good-bye, dear mother, for present.\n\n    WALT.\n\n_Tuesday afternoon, 3 o'clock._ Mother, just as I was going to seal my\nletter, Major Hapgood has come in from the P. O. and brings me a few lines\nfrom George, which I enclose--you will see they were written four days\nago.\n\n\nXVI\n\n_Washington, May 6, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I write you a few lines, as I\nknow you feel anxious these times. I suppose the New York papers must have\nit in this morning that the Army of the Potomac has made a move, and has\ncrossed the Rapidan river. At any rate that is the case. As near as I can\nlearn about Burnside's army, that lies in the rear of the Army of the\nPotomac (from Warrenton, Virginia and so to Rappahannock river and up\ntoward Manassas). It still appears to be kept as a reserve and for\nemergencies, etc. I have not heard anything from the 51st. Mother, of\ncourse you got my letter of Tuesday, 3rd, with the letter from George\ndated Bristoe station. I have writ to George since, and addressed the\nletter Warrenton, Va., or elsewhere, thinking he might get it.\n\nMother, the idea is entertained quite largely here that the Rebel army\nwill retreat to Richmond, as it is well known that Grant is very strong\n(most folks say too strong for Lee). I suppose you know we menace them\nalmost as much from up Fortress Monroe as we do from the Rapidan. Butler\nand W. F. Smith are down there with at least fifty or sixty thousand men,\nand will move up simultaneously with Grant. The occasion is very serious,\nand anxious, but somehow I am full of hope, and feel that we shall take\nRichmond--(I hope to go there yet before the hot weather is past). Dear\nmother, I hope you are well, and little California--love to Jeff and Mat\nand all.\n\n    WALT.\n\nMother, you ought to get this letter Saturday forenoon, as it will be in\nN. Y. by sunrise Saturday, 7th.\n\nMother, the poor soldier with diarrhoea is still living, but, O, what a\nlooking object; death would be a boon to him; he cannot last many hours.\nCunningham, the Ohio boy with leg amputated at thigh, has picked up beyond\nexpectation now!--looks altogether like getting well. The hospitals are\nvery full. I am very well indeed--pretty warm here to-day.\n\n\nXVII\n\n_Washington, Monday, 2 o'clock--May 9, '64._ DEAREST MOTHER--There is\nnothing from the army more than you know in the N. Y. papers. The fighting\nhas been hard enough, but the papers make lots of additional items, and a\ngood deal that they just entirely make up. There are from 600 to 1000\nwounded coming up here--not 6 to 8000 as the papers have it. I cannot hear\nwhat part the 9th Corps took in the fight of Friday and afterwards, nor\nwhether they really took any at all--(they, the papers, are determined to\nmake up just anything). Mother, I received your letter and Han's--and was\nglad indeed to get both. Mother, you must not be under such apprehension,\nas I think it is not warranted.\n\nSo far as we get news here, we are gaining the day, so far _decidedly_. If\nthe news we hear is true that Lee has been repulsed and driven back by\nGrant, and that we are masters of the field, and pursuing them--then I\nthink Lee will retreat south, and Richmond will be abandoned by the Rebs.\nBut of course time only can develope what will happen. Mother, I will\nwrite again Wednesday, or before, if I hear anything to write. Love to\nJeff and Mat and all.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXVIII\n\n_Washington, May 10, '64_ (_1/2 past 2 p.m._) DEAREST MOTHER--There is\nnothing perhaps more than you see in the N. Y. papers. The fighting down\nin the field on the 6th I think ended in our favor, though with pretty\nsevere losses to some of our divisions. The fighting is about 70 miles\nfrom here, and 50 from Richmond--on the 7th and 8th followed up by the\nRebel army hauling off, they say retreating, and Meade pursuing. It is\nquite mixed yet, but I guess we have the best of it. If we really have,\nRichmond is a goner, for they cannot do any better than they have done.\nThe 9th Corps was in the fight, and where I cannot tell yet, but from the\nwounded I have seen I don't think that Corps was deeply in. I have seen\n300 wounded. They came in last night. I asked for men of 9th Corps, but\ncould not find any at all. These 300 men were not badly wounded, mostly in\narms, hands, trunk of body, etc. They could all walk, though some had an\nawful time of it. They had to fight their way with the worst in the middle\nout of the region of Fredericksburg, and so on where they could get across\nthe Rappahannock and get where they found transportation to Washington.\nThe Gov't has decided, (or rather Gen. Meade has) to occupy Fredericksburg\nfor depot and hospital--(I think that is a first rate decision)--so the\nwounded men will receive quick attention and surgery, instead of being\nracked through the long journey up here. Still, many come in here. Mother,\nmy impression is that we have no great reason for alarm or sadness about\nGeorge so far. Of course I _know_ nothing. Well, good-bye, dearest mother.\n\n    WALT.\n\nMother, I wrote you yesterday, too. Tell dear brother Jeff to write me.\nLove to Mat. The poor diarrhoea man died, and it was a boon. Oscar\nCunningham, 82nd Ohio, has had a relapse. I fear it is going bad with him.\nLung diseases are quite plenty--night before last I staid in hospital all\nnight tending a poor fellow. It has been awful hot here--milder to-day.\n\n\nXIX\n\n[_Washington_] _May 12, 1/2 past 5 p.m._ DEAREST MOTHER--George is all\nright, unhurt, up to Tuesday morning, 10th inst. The 51st was in a bad\nbattle last Friday; lost 20 killed, between 40 and 50 wounded. I have just\nseen some of the 51st wounded just arrived, one of them Fred Saunders,\nCorporal Co. K, George's company. He said when he left the 51st was in\nrear on guard duty. He left Tuesday morning last. The papers have it that\nBurnside's Corps was in a fight Tuesday, but I think it most probable the\n51st was not in it.\n\nFred McReady is wounded badly, but not seriously. Sims is safe. You see Le\nGendre is wounded--he was shot through the bridge of nose.\n\nMother, you ought to get this Friday forenoon, 13th. I will write again\nsoon. Wrote once before to-day.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXX\n\n_Washington, May 13, 1864, 2 o'clock p. m._ DEAREST MOTHER--I wrote you a\nhurried letter late yesterday afternoon but left it myself at the P. O. in\ntime for the mail. You ought to have got it this forenoon, or afternoon at\nfurthest. I sent you two letters yesterday. I hope the carrier brings you\nyour letters the same day. I wrote to the Brooklyn postmaster about it. I\nhave heard from George up to Tuesday morning last, 10th, till which time\nhe was safe. The battle of Friday, 6th, was very severe. George's Co. K\nlost one acting sergeant, Sturgis, killed, 2 men killed, 4 wounded. As I\nwrote yesterday, I have seen here Corp. Fred Saunders of Co. K, who was\nwounded in side, nothing serious, in Friday's fight, and came up here. I\nalso talked with Serg. Brown, Co. F, 51st, rather badly wounded in right\nshoulder. Saunders said, when he left Tuesday morning he heard (or saw\nthem there, I forget which) the 51st and its whole division were on guard\nduty toward the rear. The 9th Corps, however, has had hard fighting since,\nbut whether the division or brigade the 51st is in was in the fights of\nTuesday, 10th, (a pretty severe one) or Wednesday, I cannot tell, and it\nis useless to make calculations--and the only way is to wait and hope for\nthe best. As I wrote yesterday, there were some 30 of 51st reg't killed\nand 50 wounded in Friday's battle, 6th inst. I have seen Col. Le Gendre.\nHe is here in Washington not far from where I am, 485 12th st. is his\naddress. Poor man, I felt sorry indeed for him. He is badly wounded and\ndisfigured. He is shot through the bridge of the nose, and left eye\nprobably lost. I spent a little time with him this forenoon. He is\nsuffering very much, spoke of George very kindly; said \"Your brother is\nwell.\" His orderly told me he saw him, George, Sunday night last, well.\nFred McReady is wounded in hip, I believe bone fractured--bad enough, but\nnot deeply serious. I cannot hear of his arrival here. If he comes I shall\nfind him immediately and take care of him myself. He is probably yet at\nFredericksburg, but will come up, I think. Yesterday and to-day the badly\nwounded are coming in. The long lists of _previous arrivals_, (I suppose\nthey are all reprinted at great length in N. Y. papers) are of men\nthree-fourths of them quite slightly wounded, and the rest hurt pretty\nbad. I was thinking, mother, if one could see the men who arrived in the\nfirst squads, of two or three hundred at a time, one wouldn't be alarmed\nat those terrible long lists. Still there is a sufficient sprinkling of\ndeeply distressing cases. I find my hands full all the time, with new and\nold cases--poor suffering young men, I think of them, and do try, mother,\nto do what I can for them, (and not think of the vexatious skedaddlers and\nmerely scratched ones, of whom there are too many lately come here).\n\nDearest mother, hope you and all are well--you must keep a good heart.\nStill, the fighting is very mixed, but it _seems steadily turning into\nreal successes_ for Grant. The news to-day here is very good--you will see\nit [in the] N. Y. papers. I steadily believe Grant is going to succeed,\nand that we shall have Richmond--but O what a price to pay for it. We have\nhad a good rain here and it is pleasanter and cooler. I shall write very\nsoon again.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXI\n\n_Washington, May 18, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I will only write you a hasty\nnote this time, as I am pretty tired, and my head feels disagreeable from\nbeing in too much. I was up yesterday to Carver hospital and again saw the\nman of the 51st, Thos. McCowell, who told me of George, up to latter part\nof Thursday, 12th inst. I questioned him, and his story was very clear, so\nI felt perfectly satisfied. He is wounded in hand; will be transferred\nsoon to New York and may call on you. He is a young Irishman, and seems to\nbe a very good fellow indeed. I have written to George, day before\nyesterday. Did you send my last letter to Han? If not, send it yet.\nMother, I see such awful things. I expect one of these days, if I live, I\nshall have awful thoughts and dreams--but it is such a great thing to be\nable to do some real good; assuage these horrible pains and wounds, and\nsave life even--that's the only thing that keeps a fellow up.\n\nWell, dear mother, I make such reckoning of yet coming on and seeing you.\nHow I want to see Jeff, too--O, it is too bad I have not written to him so\nlong--and Mat, too, and little California and all. I am going out now a\nlittle while. I remain first rate, as well as ever.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXII\n\n_Washington, Monday forenoon, May 23, '64._ DEAR BROTHER JEFF--I received\nyour letter yesterday. I too had got a few lines from George, dated on the\nfield, 16th. He said he had also just written to mother. I cannot make out\nthere has been any fighting since in which the 9th Corps has been engaged.\nI do hope mother will not get despondent and so unhappy. I suppose it is\nidle to say I think George's chances are very good for coming out of this\ncampaign safe, yet at present it seems to me so--but it is indeed idle to\nsay so, for no one can tell what a day may bring forth. Sometimes I think\nthat should it come, when it _must_ be, to fall in battle, one's anguish\nover a son or brother killed would be tempered with much to take the edge\noff. I can honestly say it has no terrors for me, if I had to be hit in\nbattle, as far as I myself am concerned. It would be a noble and manly\ndeath and in the best cause. Then one finds, as I have the past year, that\nour feelings and imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole\nmatter. Of the many I have seen die, or known of, the past year, I have\nnot seen or heard of _one_ who met death with any terror. Yesterday\nafternoon I spent a good part of the afternoon with a young man of 17,\nnamed Charles Cutter, of Lawrence city, Mass., 1st Mass. heavy artillery,\nbattery M. He was brought in to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in\nabdomen. Well, I thought to myself as I sat looking at him, it ought to be\na relief to his folks after all, if they could see how little he suffered.\nHe lay very placid in a half lethargy with his eyes closed. It was very\nwarm, and I sat a long while fanning him and wiping the sweat. At length\nhe opened his eyes quite wide and clear and looked inquiringly around. I\nsaid, \"What is it, my dear? do you want anything?\" He said quietly, with a\ngood natured smile, \"O nothing; I was only looking around to see who was\nwith me.\" His mind was somewhat wandering, yet he lay so peaceful, in his\ndying condition. He seemed to be a real New England country boy, so good\nnatured, with a pleasant homely way, and quite a fine looking boy. Without\nany doubt he died in course of night.\n\nThere don't seem to be any war news of importance very late. We have been\nfearfully disappointed with Sigel not making his junction from the lower\npart of the valley, and perhaps harassing Lee's left or left rear, which\nthe junction or equivalent to it was an indispensable part of Grant's\nplan, we think. This is one great reason why things have lagged so with\nthe Army. Some here are furious with Sigel. You will see he has been\nsuperseded. His losses [in] his repulse are not so important, though\nannoying enough, but it was of the greatest consequence that he should\nhave hastened through the gaps ten or twelve days ago at all hazards and\ncome in from the west, keeping near enough to our right to have assistance\nif he needed it. Jeff, I suppose you know that there has been quite a\nlarge army lying idle, mostly of artillery reg'ts, manning the numerous\nforts around here. They have been the fattest and heartiest reg'ts\nanywhere to be seen, and full in numbers, some of them numbering 2000 men.\nWell, they have all, every one, been shoved down to the front. Lately we\nhave had the militia reg'ts pouring in here, mostly from Ohio. They look\nfirst rate. I saw two or three come in yesterday, splendid American young\nmen, from farms mostly. We are to have them for a hundred days and\nprobably they will not refuse to stay another hundred. Jeff, tell mother I\nshall write Wednesday certain (or if I hear anything I will write\nto-morrow). I still think we shall get Richmond.\n\n    WALT.\n\nJeff, you must take this up to mother as soon as you go home. Jeff, I have\nchanged my quarters. I moved Saturday last. I am now at 502 Pennsylvania\nav., near 3rd st. I still go a little almost daily to Major Hapgood's,\ncor. 15th and F sts., 5th floor. Am apt to be there about 12 or 1. See\nFred McReady and others of 51st. George's letter to me of 16th I sent to\nHan. Should like to see Mr. Worther if he comes here--give my best\nremembrance to Mr. Lane.\n\nI may very likely go down for a few days to Ball Plain and Fredericksburg,\nbut one is wanted here permanently more than any other place. I have\nwritten to George several times in hopes one at least may reach him.\nMatty, my dear sister, how are you getting along? O how I should like to\nsee you this very day.\n\n\nXXIII\n\n_Washington, May 25, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have not heard anything of\nGeorge or the reg't or Corps more than I have already written. I got\nJeff's letter on Sunday and wrote to him next day, which you have seen,\nmother, of course. I have written to Han and sent her George's letter to\nme dated 16th. I have heard that the 9th Corps has been moved to the\nextreme left of the army. I should think by accounts this morning that the\narmy must be nearly half way from Fredericksburg to Richmond. The advance\ncan't be more than 30 to 35 miles from there. I see Fred McReady about\nevery other day. I have to go down to Alexandria, about 6 miles from\nhere. He is doing quite well, but very tired of the confinement. I still\ngo around daily and nightly among wounded. Mother, it is just the same old\nstory; poor suffering young men, great swarms of them, come up here now\nevery day all battered and bloody--there have 4000 arrived here this\nmorning, and 1500 yesterday. They appear to be bringing them all up here\nfrom Fredericksburg. The journey from the field till they get aboard the\nboats at Ball plain is horrible. I believe I wrote several times about\nOscar Cunningham, 82nd Ohio, amputation of right leg, wounded over a year\nago, a friend of mine here. He is rapidly sinking; said to me yesterday,\nO, if he could only die. The young lad Cutter, of 1st Massachusetts heavy\nartillery, I was with Sunday afternoon, (I wrote about in Jeff's letter)\nstill holds out. Poor boy, there is no chance for him at all.\n\nBut mother, I shall make you gloomy enough if I go on with these kind of\nparticulars--only I know you like to hear about the poor young men, after\nI have once begun to mention them. Mother, I have changed my quarters--am\nat 502 Pennsylvania av., near 3d street, only a little way from the\nCapitol. Where I was, the house was sold and the old lady I hired the room\nfrom had to move out and give the owner possession. I like my new quarters\npretty well--I have a room to myself, 3d story hall bedroom. I have my\nmeals in the house. Mother, it must be sad enough about Nance and the\nyoung ones. Is the little baby still hearty? I believe you wrote a few\nweeks after it was born that it was quite a fine child. I see you had a\ndraft in the 3d Congressional district. I was glad enough to see Jeff's\nname was not drawn. We have had it awful hot here, but there was a sharp\nstorm of thunder and lightning last night, and to-day it is fine. Mother,\ndo any of the soldiers I see here from Brooklyn or New York ever call upon\nyou? They sometimes say they will here. Tell Jeff I got a letter yesterday\nfrom W. E. Worthen, in which he sent me some money for the men. I have\nacknowledged it to Mr. W. by letter. Well, dear mother, I must close. O,\nhow I want to see you all--I will surely have to come home as soon as this\nRichmond campaign is decided--then I want to print my new book. Love to\nMat--write to a fellow often as you can.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXIV\n\n_Washington, May 30, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have no news at all to write\nthis time. I have not heard anything of the 51st since I last wrote you,\nand about the general war news only what you see in the papers. Grant is\ngradually getting nearer and nearer to Richmond. Many here anticipate that\nshould Grant go into Richmond, Lee will make a side movement and march up\nwest into the North, either to attempt to strike Washington, or to go\nagain into Pennsylvania. I only say if that should happen, I for one shall\nnot be dissatisfied so very much. Well, mother, how are you getting along\nhome?--how do you feel in health these days, dear mother? I hope you are\nwell and in good heart yet. I remain pretty well: my head begins to\ntrouble me a little with a sort of fullness, as it often does in the hot\nweather. Singular to relate, the 1st Mass. artillery boy, Charles Cutter,\nis still living, and may get well. I saw him this morning. I am still\naround among wounded same, but will not make you feel blue by filling my\nletter with sad particulars.\n\nI am writing this in Willard's hotel, hurrying to catch this afternoon's\nmail. Mother, do you get your letters now next morning, as you ought? I\ngot a letter from the postmaster of Brooklyn about it--said if the letters\nwere neglected again, to send him word. I have not heard from home now in\nsome days. I am going to put up a lot of my old things in a box and send\nthem home by express. I will write when I send them. Have you heard\nanything from Mary or Han lately? I should like to hear. Tell Jeff he must\nwrite, and you must, too, mother. I have been in one of the worst\nhospitals all the forenoon, it containing about 1600. I have given the men\npipes and tobacco. (I am the only one that gives them tobacco.) O how much\ngood it does some of them--the chaplains and most of the doctors are down\nupon it--but I give them and let them smoke. To others I have given\noranges, fed them, etc. Well, dear mother, good-bye--love to Matty and\nSis.\n\n    WALT.\n\nFred McReady is coming home very soon on furlough--have any of the\nsoldiers called on you?\n\n\nXXV\n\n_Washington, June 3, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--Your letter came yesterday. I\nhave not heard the least thing from the 51st since--no doubt they are down\nthere with the army near Richmond. I have not written to George lately. I\nthink the news from the Army is very good. Mother, you know of course that\nit is now very near Richmond indeed, from five to ten miles. Mother, if\nthis campaign was not in progress I should not stop here, as it is now\nbeginning to tell a little upon me, so many bad wounds, many putrefied,\nand all kinds of dreadful ones, I have been rather too much with--but as\nit is, I certainly remain here while the thing remains undecided. It is\nimpossible for me to abstain from going to see and minister to certain\ncases, and that draws me into others, and so on. I have just left Oscar\nCunningham, the Ohio boy--he is in a dying condition--there is no hope for\nhim--it would draw tears from the hardest heart to look at him--he is all\nwasted away to a skeleton, and looks like some one fifty years old. You\nremember I told you a year ago, when he was first brought in, I thought\nhim the noblest specimen of a young Western man I had seen, a real giant\nin size, and always with a smile on his face. O what a change. He has long\nbeen very irritable to every one but me, and his frame is all wasted away.\nThe young Massachusetts 1st artillery boy, Cutter, I wrote about is dead.\nHe is the one that was brought in a week ago last Sunday badly wounded in\nbreast. The deaths in the principal hospital I visit, Armory-square,\naverage one an hour.\n\nI saw Capt. Baldwin of the 14th this morning; he has lost his left arm--is\ngoing home soon. Mr. Kalbfleisch and Anson Herrick, (M. C. from New York),\ncame in one of the wards where I was sitting writing a letter this\nmorning, in the midst of the wounded. Kalbfleisch was so much affected by\nthe sight that he burst into tears. O, I must tell you, I [gave] in Carver\nhospital a great treat of ice cream, a couple of days ago--went round\nmyself through about 15 large wards--(I bought some ten gallons, very\nnice). You would have cried and been amused too. Many of the men had to be\nfed; several of them I saw cannot probably live, yet they quite enjoyed\nit. I gave everybody some--quite a number [of] Western country boys had\nnever tasted ice cream before. They relish such things [as] oranges,\nlemons, etc. Mother, I feel a little blue this morning, as two young men I\nknew very well have just died. One died last night, and the other about\nhalf an hour before I went to the hospital. I did not anticipate the death\nof either of them. Each was a very, very sad case, so young. Well mother,\nI see I have written you another gloomy sort of letter. I do not feel as\nfirst rate as usual.\n\n    WALT.\n\nYou don't know how I want to come home and see you all; you, dear mother,\nand Jeff and Mat and all. I believe I am homesick--something new for\nme--then I have seen all the horrors of soldiers' life and not been kept\nup by its excitement. It is awful to see so much, and not be able to\nrelieve it.\n\n\nXXVI\n\n_Washington, June 7, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I cannot write you anything\nabout the 51st, as I have not heard a word. I felt very much disturbed\nyesterday afternoon, as Major Hapgood came up from the paymaster general's\noffice, and said that news had arrived that Burnside was killed, and that\nthe 9th Corps had had a terrible slaughter. He said it was believed at the\npaymaster general's office. Well, I went out to see what reliance there\nwas on it. The rumor soon spread over town, and was believed by many--but\nas near as I can make it out, it proves to be one of those unaccountable\nstories that get started these times. Saturday night we heard that Grant\nwas routed completely, etc. etc.--so that's the way stories fly. I suppose\nyou hear the same big lies there in Brooklyn. Well, the truth is sad\nenough, without adding anything to it--but Grant is not destroyed yet, but\nI think is going into Richmond yet, but the cost is terrible. Mother, I\nhave not felt well at all the last week. I had spells of deathly faintness\nand bad trouble in my head too, and sore throat (quite a little budget,\nain't they?) My head was the worst, though I don't know, the faint spells\nwere not very pleasant--but I feel so much better this forenoon I believe\nit has passed over. There is a very horrible collection in Armory\nbuilding, (in Armory-square hospital)--about 200 of the worst cases you\never see, and I had been probably too much with them. It is enough to melt\nthe heart of a stone; over one third of them are amputation cases. Well,\nmother, poor Oscar Cunningham is gone at last. He is the 82d Ohio boy\n(wounded May 3d, '63). I have written so much of him I suppose you feel as\nif you almost knew him. I was with him Saturday forenoon and also evening.\nHe was more composed than usual, could not articulate very well. He died\nabout 2 o'clock Sunday morning--very easy they told me. I was not there.\nIt was a blessed relief; his life has been misery for months. The cause of\ndeath at last was the system absorbing the pus, the bad matter, instead of\ndischarging it from [the] wound. I believe I told you I was quite blue\nfrom the deaths of several of the poor young men I knew well, especially\ntwo I had strong hopes of their getting up. Things are going pretty badly\nwith the wounded. They are crowded here in Washington in immense numbers,\nand all those that come up from the Wilderness and that region, arrived\nhere so neglected, and in such plight, it was awful--(those that were at\nFredericksburg and also from Ball Plain). The papers are full of puffs,\netc., but the truth is, the largest proportion of worst cases got little\nor no attention. We receive them here with their wounds full of\nworms--some all swelled and inflamed. Many of the amputations have to be\ndone over again. One new feature is that many of the poor afflicted young\nmen are crazy. Every ward has some in it that are wandering. They have\nsuffered too much, and it is perhaps a privilege that they are out of\ntheir senses. Mother, it is most too much for a fellow, and I sometimes\nwish I was out of it--but I suppose it is because I have not felt first\nrate myself. I am going to write to George to-day, as I see there is a\ndaily mail to White House. O, I must tell you that we get the wounded from\nour present field near Richmond much better than we did from the\nWilderness and Fredericksburg. We get them now from White House. They are\nput on boats there, and come all the way here, about 160 or 170 miles.\nWhite House is only twelve or fifteen miles from the field, and is our\npresent depot and base of supplies. It is very pleasant here to-day, a\nlittle cooler than it has been--a good rain shower last evening. The\nWestern reg'ts continue to pour in here, the 100 days men;--may go down to\nfront to guard posts, trains, etc.\n\nWell, mother, how do things go on with you all? It seems to me if I could\nonly be home two or three days, and have some good teas with you and Mat,\nand set in the old basement a while, and have a good time and talk with\nJeff, and see the little girls, etc., I should be willing to keep on\nafterward among these sad scenes for the rest of the summer--but I shall\nremain here until this Richmond campaign is settled, anyhow, unless I get\nsick, and I don't anticipate that. Mother dear, I hope you are well and in\nfair spirits--you must try to. Have you heard from sister Han?\n\n    WALT.\n\nYou know I am living at 502 Pennsylvania av. (near 3d st.)--it is not a\nvery good place. I don't like it so well as I did cooking my own grub--and\nthe air is not good. Jeff, you must write.\n\n\nXXVII\n\n_Washington, June 10, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER--I got your letter dated last\nWednesday. I do not always depend on ----'s accounts. I think he is apt to\nmake things full as bad as they are, if not worse.\n\nMother, I was so glad to get a letter from Jeff this morning, enclosing\none from George dated June 1st. It was so good to see his handwriting once\nmore. I have not heard anything of the reg't--there are all sorts of\nrumors here, among others that Burnside does not give satisfaction to\nGrant and Meade, and that it is expected some one else will be placed in\ncommand of 9th Corps. Another rumor more likely is that our base of the\narmy is to be changed to Harrison's Landing on James river instead of\nWhite House on Pamunkey.\n\nMother, I have not felt well again the last two days as I was Tuesday, but\nI feel a good deal better this morning. I go round, but most of the time\nfeel very little like it. The doctor tells me I have continued too long in\nthe hospitals, especially in a bad place, Armory building, where the worst\nwounds were, and have absorbed too much of the virus in my system--but I\nknow it is nothing but what a little relief and sustenance of [the] right\nsort will set right. I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office. He is\nvery busy paying off some men whose time is out; they are going home to\nNew York. I wrote to George yesterday. We are having very pleasant weather\nhere just now. Mother, you didn't mention whether Mary had come, so I\nsuppose she has not. I should like to see her and Ansel too. The wounded\nstill come here in large numbers--day and night trains of ambulances. Tell\nJeff the $10 from Mr. Lane for the soldiers came safe. I shall write to\nJeff right away. I send my love to Mat and all. Mother, you must try to\nkeep good heart.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n_Washington, June 14, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER. I am not feeling very well\nthese days--the doctors have told me not to come inside the hospitals for\nthe present. I send there by a friend every day; I send things and aid to\nsome cases I know, and hear from there also, but I do not go myself at\npresent. It is probable that the hospital poison has affected my system,\nand I find it worse than I calculated. I have spells of faintness and very\nbad feeling in my head, fullness and pain--and besides sore throat. My\nboarding place, 502 Pennsylvania av., is a miserable place, very bad air.\nBut I shall feel better soon, I know--the doctors say it will pass\nover--they have long told me I was going in too strong. Some days I think\nit has all gone and I feel well again, but in a few hours I have a spell\nagain. Mother, I have not heard anything of the 51st. I sent George's\nletter to Han. I have written to George since. I shall write again to him\nin a day or two. If Mary comes home, tell her I sent her my love. If I\ndon't feel better before the end of this week or beginning of next, I may\ncome home for a week or fortnight for a change. The rumor is very strong\nhere that Grant is over the James river on south side--but it is not in\nthe papers. We are having quite cool weather here. Mother, I want to see\nyou and Jeff so much. I have been working a little at copying, but have\nstopt it lately.\n\n    WALT.\n\n\nXXIX\n\n_Washington, June 17, 1864._ DEAREST MOTHER. I got your letter this\nmorning. This place and the hospitals seem to have got the better of me. I\ndo not feel so badly this forenoon--but I have bad nights and bad days\ntoo. Some of the spells are pretty bad--still I am up some and around\nevery day. The doctors have told me for a fortnight I must leave; that I\nneed an entire change of air, etc.\n\nI think I shall come home for a short time, and pretty soon. (I will try\nit two or three days yet though, and if I find my illness goes over I will\nstay here yet awhile. All I think about is to be here if any thing should\nhappen to George).\n\nWe don't hear anything more of the army than you do there in the papers.\n\n    WALT.\n\nMother, if I should come I will write a day or so before.\n\n\n_The letter of June 17, 1864, is the last of Whitman's, written from\nWashington at or about this time, that has been preserved and come down to\nus. Many, probably many more than have been kept, have been lost; indeed,\nit is a wonder that so many were saved, for they were sent about from one\nmember of the family to another, and when once read seem to have been\nlittle valued. The reader will have noticed a certain change of tone in\nthe later letters, showing that Whitman was beginning to feel the inroads\nwhich the fatigues, the unhealthy surroundings of the hospitals, and\nespecially the mental anxiety and distress inseparable from his work\nthere, were making upon even his superb health. Down to the time of his\nhospital work he had never known a day's sickness, but thereafter he never\nagain knew, except at intervals which grew shorter and less frequent as\ntime went on, the buoyant vigor and vitality of his first forty-four\nyears. From 1864 to the end of 1872 the attacks described in his \"Calamus\"\nletters became from year to year more frequent and more severe, until, in\nJanuary, 1873, they culminated in an attack of paralysis which never left\nhim and from the indirect effects of which he died in 1892._\n\n_But for years, though often warned and sent away by the doctors, during\nhis better intervals and until his splendid health was quite broken by\nhospital malaria and the poison absorbed from gangrenous wounds, he\ncontinued his ministrations to the sick and the maimed of the war. Those\nwho joined the ranks and fought the battles of the Republic did well; but\nwhen the world knows, as it is beginning to know, how this man, without\nany encouragement from without, under no compulsion, simply, without beat\nof drum or any cheers of approval, went down into those immense lazar\nhouses and devoted his days and nights, his heart and soul, and at last\nhis health and life, to America's sick and wounded sons, it will say that\nhe did even better._\n\n_R.

Hat doch Whitman\nselbst oft genug von sämtlichen Dichtern der Veruneinigten Staaten\nEuropas, übrigens in Worten größten Respektes, gesagt, daß sie der\nVergangenheit und dem Zeitalter des Feudalismus angehören, mit Ausnahme\ndes einen Goethe, der seine besondere Stellung dadurch hat, daß er ein\nKönig ohne Land, ein Dichter ohne Nation ist. Amerika ist für Walt\nWhitman das Reich der Zukunft, der noch nicht fertigen, sondern erst\nzusammenwachsenden, anschießenden Volksgemeinschaft.\n\nEs wäre nüchterne Kleinlichkeit, vielleicht auch so etwas wie politische\nEifersucht, wollte man dem Dichter einwenden, solcher Standpunkt zeuge\ndoch von gefährlichem, übertriebenem Hochmut. Denn um Whitmans\nSelbstgefühl, das er von sich und seinem Volke hat, zu verstehen, muß\nman die Art Politik beiseite lassen; die wohnt etliche Stockwerke tiefer\nals solche Kulturbetrachtung aus der Höhe der wollenden\nDichterphantasie. Whitman hat -- wiewohl er es nicht gerade so ausdrückt\n-- von seinem Volke das Gefühl, daß es ein neuer Beginn ist, frische,\naus Völkermischung entstandene Barbaren, die einen Abschnitt in die\nGeschichte bringen. Man denke daran, wie die Germanen, schon zu den\nZeiten des Arminius, der sogar seinen Namen von der römischen gens\nArminia genommen hat -- wie hieß er in Wahrheit? Gewiß nicht Hermann,\naber vielleicht Sigfrid? --, wie diese Germanen vielfach vertraut waren\nmit der großen griechisch-römischen Kultur, und wie sie doch, zumal als\nder neue Mythos, das Christentum, über sie gekommen war, mit einer ganz\nneuen, primitiver scheinenden Kultur anheben mußten. So sind für\nWhitman, der in sich selbst die große, wilde, durch keinerlei Konvention\ngebrochene Natur fühlt, die Amerikaner ein eben erst werdendes neues\nVolk, Barbaren und Beginnende: und den neuen, großen Glauben, die neue\nKunst, die allem großen Volke vorleuchten muß, will er selbst ihnen\nschaffen helfen. Sein Selbstgefühl ist viel mehr ein Gefühl seines Volks\nals seiner selbst; man darf sich durch das mystische »Myself« (Ich)\nseiner Verse nicht irre machen lassen; er hat es ganz klar empfunden und\ngesagt, daß er nur ein erster, kleiner Beginn ist, ein früher Vorläufer\neines amerikanisch-perikleischen Zeitalters. Und er hat überdies immer\ngemeint, daß Amerika nur den besonderen Beruf hat, ein paar Schritte\nvoraus zu sein, daß aber alle Völker der Erde den nämlichen Weg gehen\nwerden.\n\nWelchen Weg? Er sagt ihn uns in seinen »Trommelschlägen«, die er während\ndes Krieges ertönen ließ:\n\n  Seid nicht verzagt, Empfindung wird den Weg zur Freiheit bahnen jetzt;\n  Die sich lieben untereinander, sollen die Unbesieglichen werden.\n  ... Dachtet ihr, Advokaten schüfen euch den Zusammenhalt?\n  Oder Verträge auf einem Papier? oder die Waffen?\n  Nein fürwahr, so ist weder die Welt, noch irgendein lebendes Ding\n      zusammengewachsen.\n\nSeine »Demokratie« ist ein freies Volk tätiger Menschen, die alle\nHemmnisse des Kastengeistes hinter sich gelassen, alle Gespinste\nüberjährter Vergangenheit durchbrochen haben; jeder auf seiner Scholle\noder in seinem Handwerk, an seiner Maschine, ein Mann für sich selbst.\nWhitman vereint gleich Proudhon, mit dem er in vielem geistig verbunden\nist, konservativen und revolutionären Geist, Individualismus und\nSozialismus. Die Liebe aber zwischen den Menschen, die noch notwendig\ndazu kommen muß, ist nach seiner Lehre, für sein Künstlergefühl, keine\nvage, im allgemeinen verschwimmende Menschenliebe; sie soll vielmehr,\nwie die Liebe, die die Familie gegründet hat, vom Geiste der\nAusschließlichkeit beseelt sein, sie soll bestimmte Menschen, Männer mit\nMännern, Frauen mit Frauen und natürlich auch Männer mit Frauen zu neuen\nsozialen Gruppen zusammenschließen. Das ist der Zusammenhang, in dem die\nKameradschaft, der Whitmans schönste und innigste Gedichte gelten, mit\nall seinen Träumen von neuen Lebens- und Volksgestalten steht. Es ist\nvergebliches Bemühen modischer Pseudowissenschaft, in diesen\nKameradschaftsgefühlen irgend etwas Perverses oder Pathologisches oder\ngar Degeneriertes finden zu wollen. Wir müssen wieder lernen, daß starke\nMänner und starke Zeiten sentimental sind; und daß schwächliche Zeiten\nund Generationen es sind, die sich scheuen, sich rückhaltlos und\ninbrünstig ihren Gefühlen, für das geliebte Weib, oder den innig\ngeliebten Freund, oder das Meer und die Landschaft und das Weltall\nhinzugeben. Whitman war diese kosmische Liebe und dieser Überschwang des\nGefühls zu eigen; und nur aus diesem Chaos und Abgrund der Innigkeit\nkann, so ist sein Glaube, sein neues Volk erstehen. Auch hier, ohne daß\ner je auf Parallelen aus ist oder nur an sie denkt, deutliche Anklänge\nan die Geisteswelt des Künstlervolkes, der Griechen, und an ihre\ngesellschaftlichen Einrichtungen und Gewöhnungen. Eine besondere\nRichtung des Empfindens hat Whitman gehabt; daraus auf eine besondere\nVeranlagung seiner Natur zu schließen, sei solchen überlassen, die sich\nauf einer Zwischenstufe der Wissenschaft befinden.\n\nDer besonderen Natur jeder gestaltenden Phantasie entspricht es, daß in\nallem Gefühl und in allem Geformten die Erotik lebt. Hätte Whitman so\nwie Faust das Evangelium Johannis zu übersetzen unternommen, sein erster\nSatz hätte wohl lauten müssen: »Im Anfang war das Gefühl.« Er betont das\nGefühl und damit die Poesie als den Anfang alles Lebens und alles Volkes\naber auch ganz bewußt, weil er weiß, von welcher Seite her den\nAmerikanern die Gefahr droht: »Was der amerikanischen Bevölkerung am\ngefährlichsten ist,« sagt er, »das ist ein Übermaß von Wohlstand,\n»Geschäft«, Weltlichkeit, Materialismus; was am meisten fehlt ... das\nist ein warmes und glühendes Volksgefühl, das alle Teile zu einem Ganzen\nvereinigen würde. Wer anders als eine Schar erhabenster Dichter kann\njene Gefahr in Zukunft abwehren, diesen Mangel ausfüllen?« Nur ein\ngroßes Volk, meint er, kann große Dichter haben; aber vorher muß die\nPoesie es sein, die das große Volk gestaltet, »künstlerischen Charakter,\nGeistigkeit und Würde« ihm verleiht.\n\nDer Dichter also, der Walt Whitman in seinem Gefühl von sich selbst und\nseiner Aufgabe sein will, ist Priester, Prophet, Schöpfer. Daß er\naußerordentliche Gewalt auf sein Volk und die geistige Macht seines\nVolkes -- und derer, die in fremden Völkern als einzelne zu seinem Volke\ngehören -- ausgeübt hat und weiter übt, ist sicher. Wie die Geschichte\nweiter geht, ob sein kühnstes Verkünden so Wirklichkeit wird, wie\nPhantasie und Wollen sich irgend erfüllen können, indem sie eine\nWirklichkeit, die nicht genau gerade so aussieht, räumlich schaffen\nhelfen, das kann keiner heute sagen. Aber das ist gewiß, daß er Amerikas\ngrößter Dichter und ein innig starker Lyriker für uns alle ist; und daß\ner der Lyrik eine neue Form und ein ungeheures neues Stoffgebiet -- alle\nTatsächlichkeiten der körperlichen und geistigen Welt -- gegeben hat.\n\n  Ich glaube, ein Grashalm ist nichts Geringeres, als das Tagwerk der\n      Sterne.\n\nIn diesem Sinne hat er sein erstes Gedichtbuch (1855) »Grashalme«\ngenannt und hat dann im Lauf von mehr als dreißig Jahren sein ganzes\ndichterisches Werk in immer neuen Auflagen in dieses Buch, sein Buch,\ndas er selbst ist, eingefügt.\n\nWhitman, geboren am 31. Mai 1819 als Sohn eines Zimmermanns und\nHausbauers im Staate New York, hat einen typisch amerikanischen\nLebenslauf gehabt, bis recht spät der Dichter aus ihm herausbrach; er\nbesuchte die Volksschule, war eine Art Laufbursche erst bei einem\nRechtsanwalt, dann einem Arzt, wurde Setzerlehrling und, im Alter von\nneunzehn Jahren, Dorfschullehrer. Dann gründet er ein Wochenblatt, reist\nals Setzer und Journalist vielfach im Lande hin und her und wird\nschließlich Zimmermann wie sein Vater in Brooklyn. Vorher hatte er\nvielerlei Aufsätze, auch kleine und größere Novellen veröffentlicht.\nWährend er Zimmermann war -- aber nicht gerade durch die körperliche\nArbeit, sondern durch die Muße; man beklagte sich wohl in der Familie\nüber sein vieles Spazierengehen und Herumliegen -- kam das Neue über\nihn: auf einmal und zugleich der neue Geist, die neue Form, und mit dem\nUnendlichkeitsgefühl auch der Unendlichkeitsstoff. Später, während des\nKrieges, ist er drei Jahre lang freiwilliger Krankenpfleger, wobei er\nden Kranken durch sein Geplauder und durch sein teilnahmsvolles\nschweigendes Bei-ihnen-Sitzen, durch seine Liebe und die suggestive\nKraft seiner Person -- alle seine Bilder zeigen, daß die Innigkeit, die\nVersunkenheit und die Mitteilsamkeit seines Wesens sich auch in seiner\nLeiblichkeit gestaltet hatte -- am meisten Gutes tat. Eine Zeitlang\nbekleidete er dann einen untergeordneten Posten in einem Ministerium,\nwobei er der Maßreglung um seiner Gedichte willen nicht entging; 1873\nerlitt er den ersten Schlaganfall, war aber noch lange in starker\ngeistiger Kraft tätig; lebte von den Erträgnissen seiner Schriften und\nUnterstützungen des Kreises, der sich mehr und mehr an ihn schloß; in\nCamden, New Jersey, ist er am 26. März 1892 gestorben.\n\nIm Alter von über dreißig Jahren also ist Whitman zu seiner Dichterkraft\ngekommen; was er vorher geschrieben, hat kaum eine Beziehung zu dem\nWesen, das nun herauskam. Einer, der langsam reift und über den es dann\nnoch mit vehementer Plötzlichkeit kommt, ist er. Das Vorwort, das er\n1855 seinem Buche mitgab, vereinigte die Reife des Mannes, der wie\neingewachsen auf seinem Platze steht, mit der blutjungen Hingerissenheit\ndes Beginnenden. »Der reichste Mann ist der, der aller Pracht, die er\nsieht, Gleichartiges aus dem größeren Vorrat seines eigenen Selbst\nentgegenstellt.« Das ist seine erste Entdeckung, zu der erst später\nEinflüsse von Fichte und Hegel gekommen sind, während, wie Bertz in\neinem übrigens ungenießbaren Buch richtig zeigt, Emerson schon damals\neingewirkt hat: daß der Mensch in seinem Ich, in seiner Geistigkeit die\nganze Welt trägt, daß die Welt nur eine unendliche Fülle von Mikrokosmen\nist, eine Pluralität und Unzähligkeit von »Identitäten«, von\nselbstbewußten Kreuzungspunkten der Weltenströme. Was er also den\nAmerikanern als Religion des Geist- und Universalgefühls bringt, ist\neine neue Form der ewigen Lehre der Philosophen und Mystiker von Indien\nüber die christliche Mystik zu den Magikern der Renaissancezeit und\nweiter über Berkeley und Fichte bis in unsere Tage: der heute sogenannte\nMonismus dagegen hat nur schwache Ähnlichkeit mit dieser Erkenntnis. Am\nmeisten Verwandtschaft hat Whitmans Lehre noch mit dem nicht\nentsagungsvollen, sondern freudig dem vollen Leben zugewandten magischen\nPantheismus, wie er sich in der Renaissance von Nicolaus Cusanus her bei\nParacelsus, Agrippa von Nettesheim und ähnlichen Geistern gebildet\nhatte. Der viele Aberglaube bei diesen darf unsere Vergleichung nicht\nstören; das war ihre gerade erst von ihnen geschaffene Natur»wissenschaft«,\nwie Whitman in unserer Natur»wissenschaft« und Technik schwelgt.\nJa, sogar in der Form findet man bei jenen Magiern der Renaissance\n-- die Whitman kaum gekannt haben wird -- Verwandtes; so hat\nAgrippa von Nettesheim ein gewaltiges Motto zu seinem Buch »Von der\nEitelkeit der Wissenschaften«[1], das nach Geist und Form völlig\nwhitmanisch ist. Ich führe es hier an:\n\n  Unter Göttern bleibt keiner ungezaust von Momus.\n  Unter Heroen jagt nach jedweden Ungeheuern Herkules.\n  Unter Dämonen wütet der König der Unterwelt Pluton gegen alle Schatten.\n  Unter Philosophen lacht über alles Demokritus.\n  Dagegen weint über das Ganze Heraklitus.\n  Nichts weiß von gar nichts Pyrrhon.\n  Und alles zu wissen dünkt sich Aristoteles.\n  Verächter des Ganzen ist Diogenes.\n  Von all dem nichts fehlt hier Agrippa. (Whitmans Myself, Ich.)\n  Verachtet, weiß, weiß nicht, weint, lacht, wütet, jagt, zaust alles.\n  Selbst Philosoph, Dämon, Heros, Gott und die ganze Welt.\n\n  [1] In zwei Bänden bei Georg Müller, München deutsch erschienen, von\n  Fritz Mauthner neu herausgegeben.\n\nAber auch mit uralten indischen Gedichten berührt sich Whitman aufs\nengste, die ja durchaus nicht alle mit dem Gefühl, daß das Ich eine\nWeltidentität sei, den Pessimismus oder die Weltflucht verbanden; wie\nman denn in Amerika gleich sagte, diese Gedichte Whitmans seien wie ein\nKonglomerat aus der »Bhagavad-Gita« und dem »New York Herald«. Das war\nsehr witzig, aber sehr falsch, denn die »Bhagavad-Gita« enthält das, was\nman da den »New York Herald« nennt, nämlich die kataloghafte Aufzählung\nder konkreten Tatsächlichkeiten der ganzen Welt, schon völlig selbst in\nsich, und die Dinge, die das indische Gedicht aufzählt, um ein Bild von\nder unendlichen Mannigfaltigkeit zu geben, waren einmal ebenso modern,\nwie die Welt der Technik, der Natur und Kultur, die Whitman in seine\nGedichte aufnimmt.\n\nNichts drängt sich beim Lesen dieser Gedichte so auf, wie das Gefühl der\nUnmittelbarkeit, der gänzlichen Abwesenheit der literarischen\nReminiszenz oder irgendwelchen Alexandrinismus. Obwohl Whitman viel\ngelesen hat, war er doch gar kein Leser und Zusammenleser, nahm nur das\nin sich auf, was schon vorher in ihm war. Darum ist es so überaus wahr,\nwas er in seinen »Grashalmen« dem Leser als Abschiedswort sagt:\n\n  Camerado, dies ist kein Buch,\n  Wer dies berührt, berührt einen Menschen ...\n\nWie jeder echte Künstler hat auch Whitman die volle Bewußtheit seines\nSchaffens, und das Beste, was ästhetisch-kritisch über ihn zu sagen ist,\nsagt er uns selbst. Das Bezeichnende an seiner Poesie ist ihre\n»suggestiveness«; ihre Suggestivkraft, in der er, wie ein Dirigent eines\nOrchesters nicht fürs Ohr, sondern fürs Auge, immer neues\nGestaltengewoge vor uns hinschweben läßt, uns die »Atmosphäre des Themas\noder Gedankens« gibt, in der dann unser eigenes Erleben weiter\ndahinfliegt. Er ist ein Dichter von ganz ungemeiner Sinnlichkeit und\nGegenständlichkeit; er scheint nur mit den Sinnen gedacht zu haben; auch\nseine ganz im inneren Erlebnis versunkenen Abstraktionen bewahren diesen\nkonkreten Charakter. Auch wenn er das Unsagbare sagen will, und wenn er\nsagen, fast stammeln will, daß es unsäglich ist, schreit er wie aus\ntiefster Besinnung zum Beginn des Gedichts etwa auf:\n\n  Das da ist in mir -- ich weiß nicht, was es ist -- doch ich weiß, es ist\n      in mir\n\nund schafft uns dadurch sofort die Stimmung des leibhaftigen Erlebens.\n\nDaß übrigens die konkrete Aufzählung einzelner Wirklichkeiten, die zu\neinem Ganzen gehören, selbst ohne Ausdruck der Empfindung des\nMiterlebenden, wenn die angeführten Tatsächlichkeiten nur von starker\nSinnfälligkeit erfüllt sind, wie ein Gedicht wirken kann, möchte ich an\neinem Beispiel zeigen, mit dem ich schon ab und zu Freunde hineingelegt\nhabe. Wie mancher möchte das folgende für ein Gedicht Whitmans halten,\ndas etwa den Titel »Nacht im Feldlager« führen könnte:\n\n  Werda! der Schildwache vorm Zelt.\n  Werda! der Infanterieposten.\n  Werda! wenn die Runde kam.\n  Hin- und Wiedergehen der Schildwache.\n  Geklapper des Säbels auf dem Sporn.\n  Bellen der Hunde fern.\n  Knurren der Hunde nahe.\n  Krähen der Hähne.\n  Scharren der Pferde.\n  Schnauben der Pferde.\n  Häckerlingschneiden.\n  Singen, Diskurrieren und Zanken der Leute.\n  Kanonendonner.\n  Brüllen des Rindviehs.\n  Schreien der Maulesel.\n\nSo, in scheinbare Verse abgeteilt findet sich das bei Goethe. Sind aber\nkeine Verse, sondern ein Versuch, bei Gelegenheit der Belagerung von\nMainz, »die mannigfaltigen fern und nah erregten Töne« »genau zu\nunterscheiden« und aufzuzeichnen. Ich kenne manches »impressionistische«\n»Gedicht« manches Modernen, das schlechter ist als dieser Tönekatalog\nGoethes.\n\nDaher, daß sein poetisches Empfinden, sein rhythmisches Verklären und\nsein Wahrnehmen immer beieinander sind, daher kommt es, daß es nichts in\nder Welt gibt, was sich unter Whitmans Hand nicht zu Dichterischem\nwandelt, daß er auch ganz und gar nicht auf die literarisch überlieferte\nMustertafel der Gleichnisse angewiesen ist, sondern ihm in einer\nwahrhaft homerischen Fülle Neues und Ungewohntes zum Bilde wird. Ist\naber dieses Beisammenwohnen des Sehens und des Empfindens, des Denkens\nmit allen Gegenständen der Welt nicht dasselbe, was er aus den Menschen\nherausholen will: Liebe?\n\n  Denn wer hundert Meter ohne Liebe wandelt, der wandelt in seinem\n      Totenhemd mit seinem eignen Begräbnis.\n\nDie Form Whitmans, die so wenig improvisierte Begeisterungsrede ist, wie\nein impressionistisches Bild, das den Eindruck der Augenblicklichkeit\nschafft, mit ein paar Pinselhieben hingeworfen wird, ist ein streng\nrhythmisches Gefüge, das aber nur das Gesetz des Tempos anerkennt, im\nübrigen sich durch keine Traditionen der Poetik binden läßt. Das\nChaotische und Massenhafte, das nicht objektiv gebändigt dargestellt\nwerden sollte, sondern in aller Gegenständlichkeit immer ein Erleben der\nEmpfindung, ein Ausfluß der Subjektivität ist, hat zu dieser Form\ngeführt, die wie ein gewaltig fortreißendes Heraussprechen und\nHerausbrechen aus einem Erleben wirkt, das mehr als ein schmales,\nisoliertes Menschen-Ich ist, das vielmehr alles, was draußen vorgefunden\nwird, aus der eigenen Universalität herausgeholt zu haben scheint.\n\nEines Tages, in der Zeit, als er die Kriegsverwundeten pflegte, schrieb\nWhitman in sein Tagebuch: »Es ist seltsam: solange ich bei den\nentsetzlichsten Szenen zugegen bin, Sterben, Operationen, ekelhafte\nWunden (vielleicht voller Maden), bleibe ich ruhig und fest und\nenergisch, wenn auch mein Mitgefühl sehr erregt ist; aber oft,\nstundenlang nachher, vielleicht wenn ich zu Hause bin oder allein\nspazieren gehe, wird es mir schlecht, und ich zittere tatsächlich, wenn\nich mich an den bestimmten Fall wieder erinnere.« Das hat er nur so\naufgeschrieben, um die Tatsache zu verzeichnen; es ist ihm nichts dabei\neingefallen, was die Tatsache zum Sinnbild gemacht hätte. Aber es kann\neinem dabei seine ganze Natur und die ganze und besondere Größe seines\nDichtertums aufgehen. Denn daß die Erlebnisse, wenn sie schon vorbei\nsind, auf einmal mit verstärkter Wucht wiederkehren, daß die\nErinnerungen mit der vollen Kraft des Erlebens auf ihn einstürmen, das\nist ein Zeichen seiner manchmal bis ins Visionäre gesteigerten\nPhantasie, ebenso wie sein Verhalten in der Mitte des Geschehnisses von\nseiner unverbrüchlichen Sachlichkeit, seiner geborenen Tapferkeit,\nseiner beherrschten Menschenliebe Kunde gibt.\n\n\n\n\nDAS SELBST SING ICH\n\n\n  _Das Selbst_ sing ich, schlechtweg den Einzelmenschen,\n  Doch äußere dazu das Wort Demokratisch, das Wort En- masse.\n\n  Physiologie sing ich von Kopf zu Fuß,\n  Nicht Physiognomie noch Hirn allein ist würdig der Muse, falls völlige\n      Form die würdigste ist,\n  Das Weibliche sing ich gleichen Rangs mit dem Männlichen.\n\n  Weiten des Lebens, Gluten, Drang und Macht,\n  Freudig um freieste Tat, erstanden aus Gottesrecht,\n  Den modernen Menschen sing ich.\n\n\n\n\nALS ICH SCHWEIGEND BRÜTETE\n\n\n  Als ich schweigend brütete,\n  Von meinen Gedichten nicht loskam, erwägend, verweilend,\n  Erhob sich vor mir ein Gespenst unheimlichen Anblicks,\n  Furchtbar in Schönheit, Alter und Macht,\n  Geist von Dichtern alter Lande,\n  Als werfe es auf mich seine Augen wie Flamme,\n  Und mit dem Finger auf viele unsterbliche Dichtungen deutend,\n  Und drohender Stimme _Was singst du?_ sprach es,\n  _Weißt du nicht, daß es für Sänger, die dauern, ein Thema nur gibt?_\n  _Und das ist das Thema des Kriegs, das Glück der Schlachten,_\n  _Die Zeugung vollkommner Soldaten._\n\n  _Sei's drum_, gab ich zur Antwort,\n  _Ich, hoffärtger Schatten, singe auch Krieg, längern und größern, als je\n      einer war,_\n  _Angehoben in meinem Buch mit wechselndem Glück,_\n  _Mit Flucht, Vormarsch und Rückzug, vertagtem und schwankendem Sieg,_\n  _(Sicherm doch, dünkt mich, oder so gut wie sicherm, am Ende,) das\n      Schlachtfeld die Welt,_\n  _Um Leben und Tod, um den LEIB und um die ewige SEELE,_\n  _Siehe, auch ich bin gekommen im Singen des Schlachtgesangs,_\n  _Ich vor allem bringe tapfre Soldaten hervor._\n\n\n\n\nIN ENGEN SCHIFFEN ZUR SEE\n\n\n  In engen Schiffen zur See,\n  Endloses Blau ringsum gedehnt,\n  Mit pfeifenden Winden, Musik der Wogen, breiter, herrischer Wogen,\n  Oder einsam winziges Boot, Boje auf weiten Gewässern,\n  Das froh, vertrauend, weiße Segel spreitend,\n  Den Äther spaltet im Schaum und Glitzern des Tags, oder unter wechselnden\n      Sternen zur Nacht,\n  Von Matrosen, jungen und alten, wie's kommt, sei ich, Nachklang vom Land,\n      gelesen,\n  In voller Beziehung endlich.\n\n  _Hier sind unsre Gedanken, Seefahrergedanken,_\n  _Hier liegt nicht Land bloß, Festland vor_, mag dann ihre Rede gehen,\n  _Der Himmel wölbt sich hier, wir spüren das wogende Deck untern Füßen,_\n  _Wir spüren das lange Pulsieren, Ebbe und Flut endloser Regung,_\n  _Die Töne des niegesehen Geheimen, die weiten schweifenden Zeichen und\n      Reize der Salzwelt, die flüssigen Laute und Silben,_\n  _Der Duft, das leise Knarren des Tauwerks, das Maß der Schwermut,_\n  _Ohne Grenzen die Sicht, weit und verdämmernd der Horizont, alles ist\n      hier,_\n  _Und das ist Meeresgedicht._\n\n  Dann wanke nicht, mein Buch, erfülle dein Geschick,\n  Du nicht ein Nachklang nur des Lands allein,\n  Du auch wie ein einsam winziges Boot, das den Äther spaltet, unbekannter\n      Bestimmung, doch immer vertrauend.\n  Genosse jeglichen Schiffs, das fährt, fahr zu!\n  Bring ihnen meine Liebe gefaltet (liebe Matrosen, ich falte sie hier in\n      jedes Blatt für euch;)\n  Spute dich, Buch!
