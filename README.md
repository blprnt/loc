# Library of Congress Residency  2017-2018
Jer Thorp - [jer@ocr.nyc](mailto:jer@ocr.nyc)

This is a repository of code, data, and miscellanea tied to my residency at the LOC. I will be endeavouring to post as much here as I can. For a complete record of research during this residency, please visit the [OSF Project I've set up](https://osf.io/b7e6w/). 

As the library is a fundamentally public institution, feedback of any kind is welcome throughout my residency. I'd love to hear from you!
